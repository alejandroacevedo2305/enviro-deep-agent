# USER REPORT FOR SITE

**Project: Intersección 1** **Template: Default Site User**

**Report**

**Site: 101 [Caso Base 2026 PM]**

New Site
Site Category: (None)
Stop (Two-Way)

Site Level of Service (LOS) Method: Delay (SIDRA). Site LOS Method is specified in the Parameter Settings dialog (Site tab).
NA: Intersection LOS for Vehicles is Not Applicable for two-way sign control since the average intersection delay is not a good
LOS measure due to zero delays associated with major road movements.
SIDRA Standard Delay Model is used. Control Delay includes Geometric Delay.
Site Model Variability Index (Iterations 3 to N): 0,0 %
Number of Iterations: 2 (Maximum: 10)
Largest change in Lane Degrees of Saturation for the last three Flow-Capacity Iterations: 0,0% 53,8% 0,1%

Site Level of Service (LOS) Method: Delay (SIDRA). Site LOS Method is specified in the Parameter Settings dialog (Site tab).
NA (TWSC): Level of Service is not defined for major road approaches or the intersection as a whole for Two-Way Sign Control
(HCM LOS rule).
SIDRA Standard Delay Model is used. Control Delay includes Geometric Delay.
