Abstract

PM 10 concentration and chemical composition (ions and carbon compounds) at three sampling stations in Rome and in its surroundings was
determined daily during a one-month field study, carried out during December 2003.
PM concentration at the traffic station was considerably higher than at the urban background and semi-rural stations; elemental carbon was
detected as one of the chemical components responsible for this increase. The difference in the concentration of sulphate and ammonium was
negligible, as it was expected for secondary pollutants. A negative artefact in the determination of ammonium nitrate by means of heated
automatic monitors was highlighted.
The dilution properties of the lower atmosphere were traced by means of a natural radioactivity monitor. This parameter has been found to play
an essential role in pollution buildup. A considerable increase in PM concentration was observed to coincide with periods of atmospheric stability.
The main difference in PM composition between periods of high concentration and periods of “clean” air was found to be in the increase of
ammonium nitrate concentration.

1. Introduction

It is widely recognised that atmospheric particles are responsible for adverse effects on the ecosystem, the climate and
the health of human beings (Arden Pope and Dockery, 2006, and
therein cited literature). However, particulate matter (PM) is a
very complex mixture of many inorganic and organic compounds of primary and secondary origin and this is the main
reason why the desired reduction of its concentration and the
identification of its many sources constitute a very difficult task.
In recent years many studies have been carried out to determine the chemical composition of atmospheric particulate matter
(among others: Chan et al., 1997; Lenschow et al., 2001;
Marcazzan et al., 2001; Harrison et al., 2004; Rees at al., 2004;
Hueglin et al., 2005; Ho et al., 2006; Vecchi et al., 2007). Most of

these studies were devoted to the identification of the main

particle sources, with the purpose to identify viable strategies for
their reduction. Less effort has been made to identify the reasons
for the daily variations of PM concentration and for the identification of the compounds that are mainly responsible for its
increase in polluted air conditions.
Understanding the different mechanisms that stay behind the
increase in PM air concentration is particularly important also in
the light of the limit values set in the European Union by the
First Daughter Directive to the Air Quality Framework
Directive, which addresses both the annual average concentration of PM 10 (40 μg/m [3] ) and its daily average concentration
(50 μg/m [3], to be exceeded no more than 35 times a year).
As in most Italian cities, the concentration of PM 10 in Rome is
often higher than the limit values stated by the Directive,
particularly during the winter season: in 2005 the yearly average
of PM 10 concentration at the traffic stations was between 40 and
50 μg/m [3] and the number of daily exceedances was between 90
and 130 (APAT Report, 2006). With its surface area of 1300 km [2]

and 2.5 million inhabitants, Rome is the largest single conurbation

622 C. Perrino et al. / Environment International 34 (2008) 621-628

in Italy, located on the west coast, about 25 km from the
Tyrrhenian sea. In the area around Rome there are no heavy
industries and the nearest power plant is at about 100 km from the
urban area. The main source for particle pollution is vehicle
emission, with more than 700 passenger cars per 1000 inhabitants
(about 70% gasoline and 30% diesel oil) (APAT Report, 2006).
The chemical composition of atmospheric particles in Rome
and in the surrounding area has been addressed by a one-month
field study, carried out in Rome in December 2003 at one semirural, one urban background and one traffic sampling stations.
The results obtained during this study enable us to get some
answers about the differences in PM concentration and composition between semi-rural and urban sites, about the influence of
atmospheric stability conditions on the mass concentration of
particulate matter and about the chemical nature of the compounds that are mainly responsible for the increase of PM under
stability conditions. The air concentration of a pollutant, in fact, is
the result of its emission rate and production rate, of contributions
of mesoscale origin, of the capacity of the atmosphere to dilute it.
In order to understand the reasons for the increase in pollutants
concentration it is thus necessary to get information not only
about pollutant emission and transformations but also about the
contribution of mesoscale sources and of the dilution properties of
the atmosphere.

2. Experimental

The data reported in this paper have been collected during a
field study carried out during December 2003 in the framework
of a research project funded by the Municipality of Rome and
addressed to obtain a first characterisation of the chemical nature

of particulate matter in the Rome area. The determinations were
carried out at the urban background station of Villa Ada (UB),
sited inside a park in the urban area of Rome, at a traffic station in
Rome (TS) and at the semi-rural station of Montelibretti (SR),
sited about 30 km NE of the centre of the city.
Particulate matter concentration was determined on a daily
basis by means of two beta monitors: SWAM5a (FAI Instruments,
Fontenuova, RM-I) at TS and SM200 (Opsis AB, Furulund-S) at
UB and SR; all monitors were equipped with Teflon filters to
allow the chemical analysis of the collected material.
EC/OC compounds were determined over 6-h time periods
by means of a automatic monitor employing a direct-measuring
thermal-CO 2 technique (Series 5400 Ambient Carbon Particulate Monitor, Rupprecht & Patashnick Co, NY-USA).
For the analysis of ions, Teflon filters were extracted in a water

− =
solution and analysed for their anionic (Cl [−], NO 3, SO 4 ) and
cationic (Na [+], NH4 [+], K [+], Mg [++] Ca [++] ) content by ion chromatography (IC, DX100, Dionex Corporation, CA-U.S.A.).
For the monitoring of the dispersion properties of the
boundary layer we used the technique based on the monitoring
of natural radioactivity due to Radon short-lived decay products.
Radon is supplied by the Earth's crust and its emission flow into
the atmosphere depends on the type, porosity, dampness and
temperature of the soil (Nagaraja et al., 2003). For a given
geographical location and for the time scale of our observation
(weeks), however, the emission flux of Radon can be considered

to be constant and the air concentration of Radon and [222] Radon
short-lived daughters ( [218] Po, [214] Pb, [214] Bi and [214] Po) can be
assumed to depend only on the dilution factor (Shweikani et al.,
1995; Porstendorfer, 1991). By monitoring natural radioactivity
due to Radon progeny attached to atmospheric particles we
obtain a reliable picture of the dilution properties of the lower
atmosphere and are able to identify periods characterised by
atmospheric stability, which favours the buildup of pollution, as
well as periods characterised by advection, which favours the
dispersion of locally emitted pollutants (Perrino et al., 2001b;
Sesana et al., 2003; Vecchi et al., 2004, 2007).
Natural radioactivity was measured by means of an automated stability monitor (PBL Mixing Monitor, FAI Instruments,
Fontenuova, RM-I) that basically consists of a particulate mattersampler equipped with a Geiger Muller counter for determining
the total beta activity of the short-lived Radon progeny. The
instrument is automatic and operates on two filters at the same
time: sampling is performed on the first filter for a 1-h sampling
duration, then this filter undergoes the beta measurement phase
while a second filter undergoes the sampling phase (residual
radioactivity is taken into account by a software procedure).
These instrumental features assure that the short-lived beta

activity of the particles is determined continuously over an
integration time of 1 h with a beta measurement period long
enough to guarantee a good accuracy of the results.
In addition to regular PM 10 measurements, at the SR station
the daily concentrations of sulphate and nitrate were also
determined by means of diffusion lines. Diffusion lines consist
in a series of annular denuders for the efficient collection of

nitric acid, sulphur dioxide and ammonia, a cyclone having the
cut size of 2.5 μm and a filter pack for the determination of
nitrate, sulphate and ammonium. Details about this technique
and about the procedure for the preparation of diffusion lines are
reported in Perrino et al. (1990), Allegrini et al. (1994), and
Perrino et al. (2001a,b). The use of diffusion lines allows a
correct discrimination of inorganic N- and S-compounds in the
gaseous and the particulate phase, without mutual interferences:
gaseous components are removed on the denuder section of the
line, avoiding chemical interactions with the filter and with the
collected particles, coarse particles are removed by the cyclone,
ammonium salts are collected on the first filter (Teflon) and
nitric acid and ammonia evolved during the sampling are
recovered on the two back-up filters (one Nylon and one acidimpregnated). By using this technique, the ammonium nitrate
loss that is typical of un-denuded single-filter systems can be
avoided. Diffusion lines sampling at Montelibretti is a part of
the Level 2 measuring strategy of the Co-operative Programme
for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission
of Air pollutants in Europe (EMEP).

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Differences between the sampling sites

The temporal pattern of PM 10 at the semi-rural (SR), urban
background (UB) and traffic station (TS) in Rome during December
2003 is shown in Fig. 1. The three series of data show similar patterns,
withhigher concentration at the traffic station (average value: 46.6 μg/m [3] )

and lower values at UB (35.9 μg/m [3] ) and SR (31.7 μg/m [3] ). The difference
between the values recorded at the traffic station and at the other two

locations increases together with PM concentration and is particularly
high during the periods 4th-6th, 17th-21st and 27th. It is reasonable to
attribute this difference to the influence of local urban emission (namely,
traffic emission) on the traffic station, while the semi-rural station is
supposed to be mostly affected by sources on a regional scale (secondary
pollutants) and the urban background station by the sum of the emissions
in the regional scale and in the total urban agglomeration. The small
difference between the UB and the SR values is a first indication of the

relevance of secondary species in determining urban PM concentration.
The chemical analysis of PM macro-components can be of help in
assessing the reasons for the increase of particulate concentration at TS
with respect to UB and SR. One possible candidate for this difference is
the elemental carbon, which is manly emitted by vehicle exhausts. The
concentration of organic carbon and elemental carbon measured by the
semi-continuous Carbon Particulate Monitor at the traffic station and at

the urban background station is shown in Fig. 2. The data show that the
time patterns of organic carbon at the two sites are quite similar,
confirming that these species are mostly of secondary origin and that
their concentration is dependent on the ageing of the air masses. The
concentration of elemental carbon, instead, is influenced by the vicinity
of the emission sources: it is much higher at the traffic station, with the
maximum difference between the two locations, again, recorded on
December 4th-6th, 17th-21st and 27th. Although EC constitutes only a
minor fraction of PM 10 mass (about 5% at UB and about 10% at TS), the
difference in EC concentration between the traffic and the urban

background station accounts, on average, for about 20% of the
difference in PM 10 concentrations.
The concentration of sulphate and nitrate ions at the traffic station and
at the urban background station during the central part of the study

-
(December 6th 25th) is shown in Fig. 3. As expected for species of
secondary origin, which are supposed to be homogeneously distributed in
the area of the study, the two time series of sulphate concentration are
quite similar both in pattern and in concentration (average values for the
campaign are 1.62 μg/m [3] at TS and 1.74 μg/m [3] at UB). The time pattern
of sulphate traces the pattern of PM 10 (Fig. 1) but its concentration has a
small impact on the total PM 10 value (less than 5%).
The pattern of nitrate, instead, shows a surprising difference between
the concentrations at TS and UB, with the values at TS up to 3-4 times

higher than the value at UB. We compared these values with the results
obtained by analysing the diffusion lines run at the EMEP station of
Montelibretti (same site of the SR station) during the same period.
Although the amounts of nitrate collected by the diffusion lines refer to
PM 2.5, it is reasonable to compare these data with the PM 10 values
recorded at TS and UB in Rome because during the examined period the
coarse fraction of nitrate was always low (average concentration:
0.3 μg/m [3], maximum concentration: 0.8 μg/m [3] ). The time pattern of
nitrate from the diffusion lines, reported in Fig. 3, resembles the ones at
TS and UB, but the concentration values are much higher than the
values recorded at UB and even higher than the values recorded at TS.
This finding points a possible sampling artefact due to the use of PM
analysers having different internal temperatures of the measurement
chamber. In the monitor used at UB (SM200), in fact, the filter is heated
at the temperature of 45 °C during and after the measurement, until it is
removed from the monitor. In the monitor used at TS (SWAM5A),
instead, the filter is kept at the local ambient temperature of 20 °C.
In order to explore the possibility for this sampling artefact, we carried
out a new field study at the semi-rural station of Montelibretti on April
2005. This study was specifically aimed to investigate the influence of the
internal temperature of the two dust monitors employed at TS and UB
during the December campaign on the determination of ammonium salts.
The two analysers were equipped with PM 2.5 sampling heads; the sulphate, ammonium and nitrate amounts collected on the Teflon filters were
compared with the amounts determined by co-located diffusion lines,
which assure an accurate and artefact-free determination of volatile

ammonium salts. The results of this study showed that in the case of a
stable compound such as sulphate the two monitors yielded the same
results and they were very close to the results yielded by the diffusion
lines. In the case of nitrate, instead, the data in Fig. 4 show that the 20 °C
monitor lost, on average, less than 15% of the collected nitrate, and the
45 °C monitor lost, on average, about 80%; similar results were obtained
for ammonium.

These results indicate that when a single filter is used, as it is in most
air quality networks, the contribution of ammonium nitrate to PM
concentration can be underestimated (Rees et al., 2004) because a fraction
of ammonium salts can be released during the sampling phase, the
measurement phase and also during the period between the sampling and
the chemical analysis; this underestimation may become severe in those
automatic monitors where the filter membrane is heated.

In summary, we may conclude that the difference between PM 10
concentration at TS and at UB and SR, reported in Fig. 1, can be ascribed
to several reasons: -- higher concentration of elemental carbon in the
vicinity of traffic emission; -- loss of ammonium nitrate at UB and SR
where a heated monitor was used; loss of the more volatile organic
components of PM, which are supposed to undergo the same process as
ammonium nitrate (this loss is not highlighted in Fig. 2 because these data
refer to the semi-continuous Carbon Particulate Monitor). These
difference can be mainly attributed to the fine fraction; it is reasonable
to presume that another portion of the difference, in the coarse fraction, is
due to soil resuspension and thus to metal components, which were not
determined in this study (Lenschow et al., 2001).

3.2. Differences between the sampling periods

The above findings offer some explanations for the differences in the
mass concentration and composition between the three sites, but it is also
worthwhile to identify the processes that stay behind the wide daily
variations in PM concentration and the differences, if any, in the
chemical composition of PM 10 during “polluted days” and “clean days”.
Day-to-day variations in the concentration of PM 10, which ranged
from about 10 μg/m [3] on December 23rd to about 100 μg/m [3] on

December 18th at TS, can hardly be attributed to variations in traffic
emissions, which, with the exception of summer holidays, are quite
constant over the year. For example, during the month of December ofthe period 2000 2004 the standard deviation of the daily number of
vehicles was always less than 10% of the monthly average, with the
only exception of December 25th (Christmas) and 26th, when traffic
intensity was always more than 30% lower than the monthly average
(data recorded by the Air Quality Network of Rome at the traffic station
of Piazza Fermi).
A different possible reason for the daily variation of PM can be found
in the local meteoclimatic conditions and mixing properties of the lower
atmosphere, which determine atmospheric dilution or stability and
consequent pollution removal or buildup.
The time pattern of natural radioactivity at the urban background
station of Rome, used as a tracer of the mixing properties of the lower
atmosphere, is reported in Fig. 5. During the winter season, advection
periods typically alternate to multi-day atmospheric stability conditions.
During advection natural radioactivity shows low values (emitted Radon
is quickly diluted into the boundary layer); during periods of strong
atmospheric stability, instead, the nocturnal inversion only slackens
during the day and natural radioactivity takes high values during the night
and also during the daytime (emitted Radon is trapped in the lower, stable

atmospheric layer) (Perrino et al., 2001b; Vecchi et al., 2004, 2007).
During the winter period, the diurnal mixing is not only weak but also
short, from the late morning to the early afternoon.
During the campaign (Fig. 5), the values of natural radioactivity were

- - -
constantly low on December 7th 9th, 16th, 22nd 25th, 28th 31st;

- -
stability periods were recorded on December 1st 6th, 14th, 17th 21st,
26th-27th, with a particularly weak daytime mixing on December 1st,
4th, 6th, 14th, 19th-20th and 27th.
Advection periods can be also detected from the graph of the wind
intensity, reported in Fig. 6. There is a good agreement between high
wind intensity and low natural radioactivity values during the whole
month. During the periods characterised by high natural radioactivity
values, however, the wind speed is very low (generally below 1 m/s) and
from these data it is not possible to get information about the strength of
atmospheric stability and, most of all, about day-to-day differences in
the intensity of the daytime vertical mixing of atmospheric layers.
The comparison of the data in Figs. 1 and 5 shows that there is a
remarkable consistency between natural radioactivity and PM time

pattern; in particular, PM increases are observed in coincidence with
periods characterised by high night-time values and, mostly, by high
daytime minima of natural radioactivity.

-
The highest PM 10 concentrations, which were recorded on 4th 6th,
17th-21st and 27th, were always in coincidence with a reduced height
of the boundary layer, mainly during the daytime. Comparing the
concentration of PM 10 at TS with a daily value obtained by a linear
combination of the daily minimum, maximum and average value of
natural radioactivity (Stability Index), we obtain the graph reported in
Fig. 7, which distinctly shows the role played by a weak atmospheric
mixing in determining particulate pollution events. In particular, the
period 25th-27th was characterised by a sharp variation of PM 10
concentration, which increased from 20 to 75 μg/m [3] within two days, in
coincidence with a strong stabilisation of the atmosphere following a 4day advection period (22nd 25th). The simultaneous sharp increase in
the Stability Index clearly indicates that the increase in PM
concentration was due to the occurrence of atmospheric stability
conditions. Also the temporal patterns of EC and OC, reported in Fig. 2,

basis of natural radioactivity values.

confirm that this increase was not due to an increase in traffic emission:

the concentration ratio between the values recorded on 27th and on 25th

was more than 5 for organic carbon, mostly of secondary origin, and
only 3.5 for the primary elemental carbon.
Considering the whole year 2003, about 70% of the exceedances
of the limit value of 50 μg/m [3] at the urban background station was
recorded during stability periods in the winter season. This findings
suggest that in geographical areas when atmospheric stability is more
frequent the actions and plans to be undertaken in order to reduce
atmospheric pollution below the limit values should be far stricter
and more severe than in areas when the meteorology plays a positive
role in dispersing pollutants.
If the concentration of the identified chemical components of PM 10
during the three days of the study when the concentration was highest
(18th, 19th, 20th) is compared with the values obtained during the three
days when the concentration was lowest (8th, 16th, 23rd) we get the
results reported in Fig. 8. Considering that the unidentified fraction was
similar (57% during the stability period and 54% during the advection
periods), the most interesting result is the manifest increase in
ammonium nitrate concentration during stability days. Ammonium
nitrate seems to be particularly sensitive to diurnal stability, and its
accumulation after a multi-day atmospheric stability period seems to be

the main responsible for PM winter pollution episodes in the urban area
of Rome.

It is important to underline that this increase in ammonium nitrate may
go partially undetected because of the easy release of ammonium salts
from the collecting surface. It follows that during extended winter
stability periods a possible underestimation of the PM 10 and PM 2.5 mass
concentration determined by mass monitors must be always taken into

account.

4. Conclusions

Differences in the concentration and composition of PM 10 at
a traffic, urban background and semi-rural station in Rome and
during different time periods of the considered month (December 2003) have been detected during this field study.
PM increase at the traffic station was mainly due to the
increase of elemental carbon and of dust resuspension. Day-today difference in PM concentration has been found to be linked
to the dilution properties of the lower atmosphere, with sharp

PM increase during atmospheric stability and low PM values
during advection. An enrichment of PM in ammonium nitrate
has been observed during extended stability periods.
The capability of the monitoring of natural radioactivity to
trace the mixing properties of the lower atmosphere and the
difficulties in obtaining a correct measurement of ammonium
nitrate concentration have been highlighted.
