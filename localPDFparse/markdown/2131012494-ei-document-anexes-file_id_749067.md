### Turnkey system solution with the new Sunny Central inverter

With the compact power of the new, robust Sunny Central inverter and with matching medium-voltage components, the MV
Power Station is a turnkey solution that is available worldwide. It represents the ultimate utility scale solution in compactness
with 1,000 V DC (2,200 kW) or 1,500 V DC (2,500 kW). Being the ideal choice for large-scale PV power plants, the integrated
20 foot container station is quick to assemble and commission as well as easy and cost-effective to transport. The compact
station itself (IEC 62271-202) and all its components are type-tested. The MV Power Station combines rigorous plant safety
with maximum energy yield and minimized operating risk. The MV Power Station’s components are delivered completely preinstalled and pre-commissioned to speed up station commissioning as much as possible.
