# OSY2 Supervisory Switch

_System Sensor’s OSY2 is used to monitor the open_

_position of an Outside Screw and Yoke (OS&Y) type_

_gate valve._

**Features**

**Robust Construction.** The OSY2 consists of a rugged housing,

intended for indoor and outdoor use. When installed with the

actuator in the vertical position, the OSY2 is NEMA 3R rated per UL.

**Application Flexibility.** The OSY2 features a user-friendly
mounting bracket and adjustable shaft to permit mounting to most
OS&Y valves, ranging in size from 1 ̋ to 12 ̋. Its right angle design
and wide bracket span provides maximum clearance for valve
components, to accommodate troublesome valves. Removing the
OSY2’s gate valve bracket allows the unit to monitor side-bracket
style pressure reducing valves.

**Simplifi ed Operation.** Installation is made easier with the
OSY2’s single side conduit entrance. By providing a direct conduit
pathway to the electrical source, right angle fi ttings are not required.
Installation is further simplifi ed by the OSY2’s adjustable length
actuator, which eliminates the need for cutting the shaft.

**Reliable Performance.** The OSY2 is equipped with tamper
resistant cover screws to prevent unauthorized entry. Inside, two sets
of SPDT (Form C) synchronized switches are enclosed in a durable
terminal block to assure reliable performance.

NEMA 3R rated enclosure

User-friendly mounting bracket fits newer valve yokes

Single side conduit entry does not require right angle fittings

Adjustable length actuator eliminates the need for cutting the shaft

Accommodates up to 12 AWG wire

Three position switch monitors vandal and valve close signals

Two SPDT contacts are enclosed in a durable terminal block for

added strength

100% synchronization activates both alarm panel and local bell
simultaneously

**OSY2 Specifications**

**Architectural/Engineering Specifi cations**

Model shall be model number OSY2 supervisory switch as manufactured by System Sensor. OSY2 shall be installed on each valve as designated on the drawings
and/or as specifi ed herein. Switches shall be mounted so as not to interfere with the normal operation of the valve and shall be adjusted to operate within
two revolutions of the valve control or when the stem has moved no more than one-fi fth of the distance from its normal position. The mechanism shall be
contained in a weatherproof die cast metal housing, which shall provide a side entrance for 1⁄2 ̋ conduit and incorporate the necessary facilities for attachment
to the valve. A grounding provision is provided. The switch assembly shall include two switches each with a rated capacity of 10 Amp @ 125/250VAC and 2.5
Amp @ 24VDC. The cover shall contain tamper-resistant screws for which a security wrench will be provided with each switch. The OSY2 shall be Underwriters
Laboratories listed for indoor or outdoor use. The OSY2 shall be Factory Mutual, CSFM, and MEA approved.
