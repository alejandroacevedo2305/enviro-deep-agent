# 3. [8] Remaining special regulations

**3.8.1** **Emission of particulates**
**during the processing,**
**preparation, transport,**
**loading and unloading as**
**well as during storage of**
**drift sensitive materials**

Standards to reduce particulate emissions must be
imposed on installations in which drift sensitive
materials are pretreated, produced, transported,
loaded, unloaded and/or stored.
A distinction must be made here between fugitive and
directional dust emissions. Directional emissions are

also considered to include emissions from ventilation

exhaust points, etc. Directional emissions may be
regarded as point sources and must comply with the
general emission standards set down in §..

In the case of fugitive emissions, no visual dust
dispersion may occur at the source.

The following classification, based on the susceptibility
of a material to be dispersed and the possibility of
dealing with the problem by wetting, is used for nonreactive products:
s highly drift sensitive, not wettable;
s highly drift sensitive, wettable;
s moderately drift sensitive, not wettable;
s moderately drift sensitive, wettable;
s not or very slightly drift sensitive.

The storage and transhipment of toxic and/or reactive
products is disregarded here because when these
products are loaded for transport or storage in bulk
they are handled in closed systems or in packaged form
and not as loose material.

Annex . to the NeR contains the classification used
for most of the commonly occurring bulk goods. This
list should not be regarded as complete and final, as it
may be supplemented or amended.

The sections which follow give guidelines in the form
of measures to limit fugitive emissions resulting from
operations involving drift sensitive materials. These
guidelines tie in with the classification into different
dispersiveness classes used for these goods.
If, despite the measures taken, dust dispersion which is
obvious to the naked eye occurs for some length of
time in the immediate vicinity of the source, for
example, due to certain weather conditions, the abovementioned operations must be temporarily suspended.

_Transport and storage of drift sensitive materials_
_containing special components_
The transport or storage of drift sensitive materials
containing compounds subject to compulsory
minimisation (carcinogens) or containing components
from classes A., A. or O. must be in package form
if possible or, if packaging is not possible, the materials
must be treated as belonging to dispersiveness class 
(or possibly ).

The above generally does not apply if the
concentration of the special components in the drift
sensitive materials in a fraction separated from these
materials by using sieves with a maximum mesh of
 mm does not exceed the following values:

- components from classes C., A. and O.:
 mg/kg dry matter;

- components from classes C., A.:
 mg/kg dry matter;

- components from class C.:
 mg/kg dry matter.

_Pre-treatment and preparation of drift sensitive materials_
Fugitive dust emissions due to pre-treatment or
preparation of dispersive materials should be prevented
by:

- closing machines and equipment completely dust
proof wherever possible;

- fitting in particular supply, removal and discharge
points with exhaust facilities at the source and
purifying the extracted air in a dust-removing filter
installation if necessary;

- wetting materials which are wettable.

**Pre-treatment or preparation**

Pre-treatment or preparation means activities such as

breaking, grinding, screening, mixing, agglomeration,

granulation, sintering, extrusion, calendering, pressing,

pelletising, tablet forming, etc.

In order to control dust dispersion resulting from the
mixing of drift sensitive materials, the following is
required:

- mixing materials belonging to dispersiveness classes
 and  is only permitted in an enclosed area, kept
under reduced pressure, and the extracted air must
be purified.

- heaps of materials belonging to dispersiveness classes
 and  in the open air may only be piled up or
dug off if the materials are wetted.

- a heap of materials may only be piled up if the slope
of the heap is not greater than the natural slope, the
last layer deposited consists of the least dispersive
component of the mixture and the layer is kept
sufficiently wet.

_Storage of drift sensitive materials_
In order to control dust dispersion during storage due
to the effects of wind, materials belonging to classes 
and  (and possibly ) must be stored in enclosed
areas (silos, sheds or covered areas). At times when no
deliveries or collections take place the storage area must
be securely closed off.
While the storage area is being filled with materials
from class  (and possibly ), the discharge point and
hence the area itself must be provided with suction
facilities and the air extracted must be purified.

Materials belonging to dispersiveness classes  and 
(and possibly ) may be stored outdoors provided the
tip is kept wet in order to prevent dust dispersion. In
the case of small-scale storage for short periods in the
open air, the material may be covered with a tarpaulin
or the like. When materials of classes  and  are
stored for longer periods in the open air, the tip should
be sprayed as often as necessary with a stabilising or
binding agent.

Spontaneous heating in coal tips must be prevented,
for example, by building up the tip layer by layer and
compacting them by rolling.

Dust emissions as a result of outdoor storage of
dispersive materials can also be limited by:

- covering over;

- erecting wind breaks;

- orienting the longitudinal axis of the storage facility
parallel to the main wind direction;

- keeping unoccupied storage sites wet and/or clean.

_Transport and loading and unloading of drift sensitive_
_materials_

Generally speaking, dust dispersion during the
transport, loading and unloading of drift sensitive
materials must be prevented by:

- limiting the height of discharge, particularly in the
open air, to less than one metre and, as far as
possible, ensuring that this height is maintained by
automatic means;

- dust nuisance due to loading and unloading in the
open air must be prevented by suspending the
transhipment activities, depending on the local
situation and wind direction, if, considering the
dispersiveness class, the wind speed exceeds the
following values:
- classes  and   m/s, wind force /
moderate breeze,
- class   m/s, wind force /
strong breeze,
- classes  and   m/s, wind force /
fresh gale;

- preventing dust dispersion of wettable materials in
dispersiveness classes ,  and  by wetting the
materials sufficiently prior to operations, where
possible;

- controlling dust emissions from wettable materials in
dispersiveness classes ,  and  during loading
and unloading by means of a mist curtain.

_Continuous mechanical transport_
In order to limit fugitive dust emission resulting from
continuous mechanical transport the following is
required:

- non-wettable materials from dispersiveness classes 
and  must be transported under contained
conditions, and the intake and discharge side of the
conveyor must be enclosed; this enclosure must be
subject to continuous suction and the extracted dust
must as much as possible be recycled into the main
product flow;

- wettable materials transported in an open conveyor
system must be wetted in such a way that dispersion
is prevented;

- the intake and discharge sides of the conveyor must
be provided with barriers in the form of wind
reduction screens or sprinklers;

- open conveyor systems in the open air must be
protected from the effects of wind by means of
longitudinal screens, transverse screens or barrel
vault roofing.

**Continuous mechanical transport**

What is meant here is conveyor belts, screw or chain

conveyors, etc.

_Hoppers_
In order to limit fugitive dust emission in the loading
of products by hoppers the following is required:

- where highly drift sensitive materials belonging to
dispersiveness classes  and  are being (un)loaded,
hoppers must be designed in such a way that after
the grab has opened over the hopper no dust
dispersion that is visible for more than  metre
beyond the edge of the hopper can occur;

- hoppers must be fitted with a (dust) extraction
system in the case of transport of substances or
materials from classes  or ;

- wettable materials (classes  and ) should, where
possible, be wetted with the aid of an effective water
sprinkling installation;

- for the loading of materials belonging to
dispersiveness classes ,  and , hoppers should
be fitted with effective wind reduction screens.

The outlet of a hopper may not give rise to dust
dispersion. The capacities of individual parts of the
loading assembly must match up with one another.
A factor to be taken into account here is the maximum

filling level of the hopper.

The maximum filling levels for different types of
material are as follows:

- classes  and  %

- classes  and  %

- class  %

_Grabs_

In order to limit dust emission due to the loading and
unloading of drift sensitive materials with the aid of
grabs the following is required:

- loading and unloading of materials belonging to the
dispersiveness classes , ,  and possibly  must
take place with grabs kept in good repair and covered
at the top;

- dust dispersion in the area surrounding the discharge
location must be prevented during the opening of
the grab;

- the grab may only be opened during unloading after
it has descended below the edge of the hopper, or,
alternatively, below the edge of the wind screens.

_Loading onto lighters_
Dust dispersion during the loading (and unloading) of
lighters should, except where materials belonging to
class  are concerned, be controlled as follows:

- in the case of materials belonging to the
dispersiveness classes , ,  and  the lighter
loading equipment must be fitted with a discharge
pipe which almost reaches down onto the bottom of
the cargo space or onto the material already loaded;

- baffles or similar devices should be fitted inside the
discharge pipe in order to reduce the speed of
descent of the material being loaded;

- the discharge pipe should be subjected to air
evacuation where highly dispersive materials are
concerned;

- where a discharge pipe of ‘fishmouth’ design is used,
air must be evacuated from the discharge pipe; the
quantity of air evacuated must be greater than that
displaced by the material loaded;

- during discharge the grabs should only be opened
once they have descended sufficiently far below the
rim of the cargo space.

_Pneumatic elevators_

Dust dispersion due to loading and discharging by
pneumatic elevators can be controlled by:

- fully enclosing weighing bunkers and discharge

areas;

- regularly removing dust deposited in the overspill

areas;

- fitting the discharge shoe with exhaust facilities.

_Traffic_
Dust dispersion due to traffic to and from the storage
site should be controlled by:

- minimising the number of traffic movements on the
site;

- ensuring that materials are moved at the site
wherever possible by continuous mechanical or
pneumatic transport systems;

- restricting motor traffic to metalled roads which are
regularly cleaned;

- installing barriers between roads and unmetalled
surfaces;

- limiting the speeds of vehicles at the site;

- keeping the roads at the site wet by spraying.

Dust dispersion by vehicles beyond the storage site
must be prevented by hosing the vehicles down and by
cleaning the tyres before the vehicles are allowed to
leave the storage site, and by utilising the loading floor,
partitioning it or covering it in such a way, that dust
dispersion through spillage onto roads becomes
impossible.
