## Reduce operation and installation costs.

The CL-6B Regulator Control builds upon
the advantages of the CL controls from
Cooper Power Systems.

**Lower operating costs.**
Realize quicker programming and interrogation
of the new CL-6B regulator control. The 4-line
display provides clear information at a glance,
and the Metering-Plus keys provide instant
access to the most commonly used information.
This simplifies operation and reduces training
time and costs.

Seasonal time changes are automatically adjusted
by the CL-6B control with the new daylight
savings time feature. The flexibility of the new
CL-6B design for upgrades and replacements
reduces inventory costs associated with
stocking multiple controls.

Control Replacement Assembly

**Quicker installation.**
SCADA ready, the CL-6B control will integrate easily into your existing system.
Cooper offers a Fiber-Optic/RS-232 or a RS-485 card to maximize flexibility.

The CL-6B control is fully configurable using one of three easy options: the
front panel, CCI software or through a compact flash card. Three communication
channels and independent DNP 3.0 certification provide assurance that this
control panel will integrate easily and communicate properly from the start.

**Improved power quality.**
The CL-6B regulator control provides flexible modes of operation, making it
adaptable to even the most complex systems, including distributed generation.
Yet, it is simple enough to allow for easy installation. All of which means you will
be able to ensure consistent delivery of quality power to your customers.

Programmable and logical I/O’s are included, allowing you to create custom logic
for the advanced operation of your controls. Fine-tuned programming capability
improves power quality.
