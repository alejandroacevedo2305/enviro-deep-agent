_Gas turbines_

The emissions from gas turbines may not exceed:

-  g  x per  in the case of existing turbines;

-  g  x per  in the case of new turbines;
In both cases the values must be multiplied by a factor
of / of the turbine efficiency.

The waste gases employed generally deviate in terms of
their caloric value from standard natural gas. The
correction factor for the emission concentration to be

used because of this is the ratio between the lowest

encountered caloric value of the used gas (in /kg)
and the caloric value of natural gas, which has been
standardised at /kg. This factor may not be greater
than . and not smaller than ..

**NO** **x** **requirement for new gas turbines**

In the case of new turbines lower emission requirementseven as low as 65 g/GJ - may be made compulsory due to

the levels guaranteed for modern gas turbines employing

dry-low NO x technologies. For these installations, steam

injection is not considered Best Available Technique.

**SO** **2** **, H** **2** **S**
In the case of fields producing natural gas with a
relatively high concentration of hydrogen sulphide and
other compounds, demands must be formulated for
  and    on the basis of further testing under actual
conditions.

_Mandatory inspections_
The above-mentioned sources must be monitored in

accordance with the provisions of §.. This having
been said, additionally the rule applies that taking
measurements may be decided against if on the basis of
properties typical for the equipment, or, alternatively,
based on certified measurements, it is possible to
reliably determine the emissions that will occur under
normal operating conditions.

_Fugitive emissions_
Pumps, compressors and safety equipment and valves
must be inspected annually in accordance with 
method . The requirement of semi-annual testing of
all valves for leakage may be relaxed to comprise an
annual random sample of % of those valves if, on the
basis of measurements, it can be demonstrated that less
than % of all valves leak an emission concentration of
, ppm per volume of all hydrocarbons taken
together or, where applicable, less than % of all valves
leak an emission concentration of  ppm per volume
of benzene.

_Furnaces, gas engines, turbines_
For the methods of taking measurements, the
frequency of inspections and the interpretation of
measurement results, as well as for the manner in
which these results must be reported, please refer to the
sections concerned in  and .

**F1** **Installations for the**

**thermal reclamation of**

**metals from cables and**
**corresponding utilities**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

In cases where the installations concerned are beyond
the scope of the Decree on air emissions from waste
incineration (Besluit luchtemissies afvalverbranding,
 [][)], nevertheless the emission requirements laid
down in that document are applicable, except that:

- the emission standards are based on an oxygen
content of % by volume;

- the incinerators must be equipped with an efficient
afterburner;

- the temperature maintained in the afterburning area
must be at least °C and this temperature must be
maintained until the end of the operating period;.

- the temperature maintained in the afterburner must
be at least °C if the items to be processed
contain  mg/kg or more of halogenated aromatic
hydrocarbons;

- independently of the combustion temperatures
indicated above, the fumes must remain in the
afterburning area for a sufficiently long time (at least
 s) and a minimum oxygen availability of % must
be maintained;

- the metal-recovery process may only be started if the
required incineration temperature has been reached;

- residues may not continue to give off fumes after
leaving the installation;

- the installations must be equipped with
measurement devices which continuously monitor
the mass concentrations of particulates and carbon
monoxide in the waste gases, and the afterburning
temperature; installations in which chlorinated
components are incinerated must be equipped with
measurement devices which continuously record the
concentration by mass of gaseous inorganic chlorine
compounds.

 For the emission standards of the Decree on air emissions from

waste incineration (Besluit luchtemissies afvalverbranding, )
refer to the explanatory note in Special Regulation A.

**F2** **Heat-based cleaning of**
**commodities including**
**electric motors and**
**equipment for processing**
**synthetic polymers**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in October ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

These regulations are applicable to the process of
thermal cleaning of electric motors in so-called
cleaning incinerators as well as to the thermal cleaning
of equipment contaminated with polymers used in the
plastic product manufacturing industry.
The material to be cleaned must have the lowest

possible content in halogen compounds. Whether the
regulations are also applicable to similar processes
depends on the nature and composition of the
materials being processed.

The installation consists of an incinerator which must be

fitted with an afterburning area (which may optionally
be integrated into the design). This afterburning area
must satisfy the following requirements:

- The afterburner must have reached its working
temperature before the thermal cleaning process is
started. To this end, a safety device must be installed
which prevents the incinerator being loaded if the
afterburner has not yet reached its working

temperature.

- The temperature must be at least °C and this
temperature must be maintained until the end of the
operating period.

- The fumes must remain in the afterburner for at

least  seconds.

- The waste gases from the installation may not be
vented if they have not been treated in the treatment
facility.

The limit mass flows quoted in §. are not applicable
to the following emissions. This means that the
requirements listed below are always applicable,
regardless of the size of the installation.
The emission standards are based on an oxygen
content of % by volume.

_Particulates_

For particulates an emission requirement of  mg/m 

applies.

**Non-standard requirement for particulate matter**

In the case of processing electric motors with a high content

in inorganic materials in the insulation utilised, a non

standard emission requirement for particulates may be

demanded on the basis of the residual concentrations

achievable by employing cyclone, gravitation or inertia-type

separators. The emission level may not exceed 50 mg/m 03 .

_Gaseous inorganic chlorides_
In the case of gaseous inorganic chlorides an emission
requirement of  mg/m  (calculated as l) applies.

_Carbon monoxide_

For carbon monoxide an emission requirement of
 mg/m  applies.

_Total hydrocarbons_
For the emissions of hydrocarbons an emission
requirement of  mg/m  (calculated as total
hydrocarbons) applies.

_Monitoring of emissions_
As an Emission Relevant Parameter () for the proper
functioning of the device, a continuous recording of the
changes in the temperatures of the incinerator and of
the afterburner may be used. In addition, the general
considerations as regards the measurement and
monitoring of emissions are applicable in accordance
with the general provisions of §. of the NeR.

**F 3** **Crematoriums**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in June _
_and amended in September . Unless specific_
_requirements for emissions are explicitly mentioned in the_
_following, the general provisions of the NeR apply._

The objective of these regulations is to indicate how

emissions to the air are restricted for an incinerator

installation in a crematorium. These regulations link up with

OSPAR Recommendation 2003/4 on reduction of mercury

emissions of crematoriums.

_Scope_
The regulations are applicable to crematoriums where
human corpses are incinerated. The regulations do not
apply to animal crematoriums. These regulations apply
to all types of cremation incinerators.
The following requirements apply to incineration
installations in crematoriums.

**Process operation**
The cremation incinerator must be fitted with an
afterburner chamber with natural gas burner where the
flue gasses from the main chamber are incinerated.
This afterburner chamber can be designed as an
integral part of the incinerator.
The afterburner chamber must be designed and
constructed in such a way that the residence time of
the flue gasses in the chamber is at least . seconds at a
temperature of at least o. When applying for a
permit, the operator must demonstrate that the
installation satisfies these requirements under normal
operating conditions. In the afterburner chamber, the
flue gasses must be mixed so vigorously that they are
incinerated as completely as possible.

The temperature of the flue gasses in the afterburner
chamber must be kept above o by means of a
burner. To this end, the burner must be fitted with an
automatic temperature control.

The oxygen content in the afterburner chamber must be
at least %; short-lasting failures to meet this level are
permissible, provided they do not last for more than a
minute and the oxygen content always remains above %.

**Process operation**

The legal framework for crematoriums and cremation

processes consists, for example, of:

 - Act on the Disposal of the Dead (Wet op de

lijkbezorging)

 - Decree on the Disposal of the Dead 2002 (Besluit op de

lijkbezorging)

 - Internment Container Decree 1998 (Lijkomhulselbesluit)

 - Environmental Protection Act (Wet milieubeheer)

 - Inspection Guideline ‘Disposal of the Dead’ 1999

(Lijkbezorging)

 - OSPAR Recommendation 2003/4 on Controlling the

Dispersal of Mercury from Crematoriums, report ‘Mercury

emissions from crematoriums and their control in the

OSPAR Convention Area’, OSPAR Commission, 2003

 - European Hazardous Waste List EURAL, Decision no.

2000/532/EEC of 6 September 2000 (PbEG L226), as

last amended by Decision no. 2001/573/EEC of 28 July

2001 (PbEG L203)

 - Waste Collection Decree

A practical elaboration of these laws and regulations is

given in the Inspection Guideline ‘Disposal of the Dead’

(revised 3rd edition of 1999 or a later edition). This special

regulation can be regarded as a further elaboration of the

inspection guideline for the aspect air pollution.

_Coffins_
It is not permitted to incinerate coffins lined with lead
or zinc. Metal and plastic handles and other ornaments
made of plastic or metal must be removed before
sliding the coffin into the incinerator.

**Emissions**

 - ‘Massabalans en emissies van in Nederland toegepaste

crematieprocessen’ (Mass balance and emission of

cremation processes in the Netherlands) TNO,

February 1996.


 - ‘Oriëntatie op de mogelijkheden van NO x

emissievermindering bij crematieprocessen’ (Orientation

on possibilities of NO x emission abatement in cremation

processes) TNO, October 1996.

 - ‘Onderzoek naar kwikemissies van crematoriums en

beschikbare reinigingstechnieken’ (Research on mercury

emissions of crematoriums and available abatement

techniques) Tauw, May 1997.

 - The requirements are based on the results of several studies.

_General_

The emission concentrations must be calculated on the

basis of an oxygen content of % under normal
operating conditions and for dry flue gasses. To assess
whether the incinerator functions properly, reference
must be made to the requirements for temperature and
residence time (see ‘process operation’).

_NO_
_x_
The formation of nitric oxides must be limited through
the use of a low- x burner in both the main chamber
and the afterburner.

_Heavy metals_
To reduce the emission of mercury and mercury
compounds, an emission abatement technique must be
utilised. This must be of such a design that the
concentration of mercury and mercury compounds in
the waste gasses does not exceed . mg/m ,
calculated as Hg. No requirements for the emission
concentration apply for the other heavy metals.

_Dioxins, hydrocarbons, gaseous inorganic compounds_
_and odours_

No additional concentration requirements are used for the
emissions of dioxins, hydrocarbons including halogenated
compounds, gaseous inorganic compounds and odours.

**Emissions**

For most of the substances mentioned in the regulation, the

emission will generally remain below the limit values of the

general requirements of the NeR in a well-functioning cremation

incinerator. For these substances, the NeR will be complied with

without further measures being necessary. The only exception is

mercury. Due to the mercury in dental fillings, the mercury

emission exceeds the general requirements of the NeR. That is

why for mercury an emission concentration requirement is

included, while this is not necessary for the other emissions.

In hot-start incinerators, the average oxygen content in the waste

gasses will be around 17%. In other incinerator types this is

considerably lower, around 12%. In order to be able to monitor

the emissions in an unambiguous way, it was decided to use a

fixed reference value of 11% for the oxygen concentration. This

value is typical for such processes and corresponds with the

value used in Germany and other countries.

If the incinerator functions properly, no visible emission of

smoke will occur.

To purge mercury from the flue gasses, various emission

abatement techniques are available. The most important are the

systems that operate by adsorption of the mercury onto activated

carbon or coke. The adsorbing agent can be injected into the

flue gasses as a powder and subsequently removed again using

a particulate filter (in-flow filter). It is also possible to pass the flue

gasses through a layer of the adsorbing agent (bed-type filter).

The ‘removed solid particulates’ or fly ash may not be

treated as cremation ash, but must be delivered to a

collector of waste products appearing on the national list of

collectors (www.niwo.nl).

_Verification and enforcement_
The temperature in the afterburner chamber and the
  content of the waste gasses must be monitored and
recorded continuously. No later than six months after
commissioning of the installation, and afterwards
annually, it must be checked whether the installation is
functioning properly. At this time, the proper
operation of the continuous monitoring equipment
must also be checked.

**Verification and enforcement**

The O 2 level and the temperature must be continuously

monitored because these parameters provide an indication of

whether the crematorium incinerator is functioning properly. No

requirements for CO have been included because if sufficient

oxygen is available the formation of CO will be largely

prevented. By continuously recording these parameters, the

proper functioning can be checked. The annual inspection

serves to assess whether the incinerator is still functioning in

accordance with the design specifications and whether the

monitoring equipment is still functioning accurately. After all,

the proper functioning of the incinerator is a prerequisite for

keeping the emissions of the substances mentioned in the

regulations within the required limits. This verification can be

performed by means of emission measurements.

Verification of mercury emissions must be done under

representative conditions The proper functioning of the

emission abatement measures can be established by using

emission relevant parameters (ERPs, NeR §3.7), either by

direct measurements of the actual emission or by

measurement of the efficiency of the abatement technique.

Representative conditions mean conditions whereby

mercury is released in the incineration process due to

amalgam dental fillings or added quantities of mercury.

Direct measurements can be taken by determining the

highest average value of the emission in a half hour period

during several incineration cycles (indicative). The

efficiency of the abatement technique is measured by using

an internal standard based on a known quantity of mercury.

This is introduced into the process and the separation

efficiency of the abatement technique is then determined.

_Alternative measures_

It is possible to take other measures to reduce emissions
than those mentioned above if it is demonstrated that

these measures are at least as effective.

_Implementation period_
The implementation periods given in the table below
apply for existing crematoriums.

When a new incinerator in an existing crematorium is
installed before the valid implementation period, the
new incinerator must be suitable immediately for an
emission abatement facility.

New crematoriums must comply with the
requirements of these special regulations upon
commissioning.

**F4** **Pyrolysis plants**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May ._

Where installations in which materials are thermally
decomposed under conditions of limited availability of
oxygen do not fall under the scope of the Decree on air
emissions from waste incineration ( _Besluit luchtemissies_
_afvalverbranding,_ _BLA_ [][)], nevertheless the emission
requirements quoted therein are applicable under the
following conditions:

- The mass flow limits mentioned in §. are
applicable.

- The emission standards are based on an oxygen
content of % by volume.

- The installations must be equipped with monitoring
devices which permanently monitor the mass
concentrations oxides of sulphur and gaseous
inorganic chlorine compounds, unless it can be
guaranteed that the items to be processed contain
only small quantities of sulphur or chlorinecontaining substances.

**F5** **Installations for the**
**thermal soil clean-up**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

In cases where the installations concerned are beyond
the scope of the Decree on air emissions from waste
incineration ( _Besluit luchtemissies afvalverbranding,_
_BLA_ [][)], nevertheless the requirements laid down in that
document are applicable, except that:

- the emission standards are based on an oxygen
content of % by volume.

) For the emission standards of the Decree on air emissions from

waste incineration (Besluit luchtemissies afvalverbranding, )

refer to the explanatory note in Special Regulation A.

**F6** **Installations for the**

**incineration of communal**
**sewage sludge from**
**sewage water treatment**
**plants**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in October_

_._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

Installations for the incineration of communal and

equivalent sewage sludge from sewage water treatments
plants must be equipped with emission abatement
techniques allowing the emission concentration
standards quoted below to be complied with.

The emission standards are based on an oxygen
content of % by volume.

_Particulates_

For particulates an emission requirement of  mg/m 

applies.

_Mercury and mercury compounds_
For mercury and mercury compounds an emission
requirement of . mg/m  (calculated as Hg) applies.

**Emissions of mercury**

The emission concentration requirement for mercury and

mercury compounds is the starting point for selecting and

dimensioning a system for the removal of mercury from the

process waste gases. If it proves impossible in a specific

situation to satisfy the requirement mentioned then the rule

applies that the efficiency of cleaning must be at least 90%.

_Cadmium and its compounds_
For cadmium and cadmium compounds an emission
requirement of . mg/m  (calculated as Cd) applies.

_Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans_
For polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans
an emission requirement of . ng/m  (calculated as
i-teq) applies.

_Gaseous inorganic chlorides_
For gaseous inorganic chlorides an emission
requirement of  mg/m  (calculated as l) applies.

_Gaseous fluorides_
For gaseous fluorides an emission requirement of
 mg/m  applies (calculated as ).

_Carbon monoxide_

For carbon monoxide an emission requirement of
 mg/m  applies.

_All hydrocarbons taken together_
For the emissions of hydrocarbons an emission
requirement of  mg/m  (calculated as all
hydrocarbons taken together) applies.

_Oxides of sulphur_
For oxides of sulphur an emission requirement of
 mg/m  applies (calculated as   ).

_Nitric oxides_

The formation of nitric oxides must be limited as

much as possible by process-integrated measures. For
installations with a furnace type producing an  x
concentration in the untreated waste gas which is
higher than  mg/m  (such as, for example,
installations with a grid-type oven), selective catalytic
reduction () may be considered as Best Available
Technique.
When employing  an emission requirement of
 mg/m  applies (calculated as   ).

**Application of SNCR**

For installations with a furnace type that produces an NO x

concentration in the untreated waste gas which is expected

to be lower than 400 mg/m 03 (such as, for example,

installations with a furnace employing fluidised bed

combustion) selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) is

recommended. Where SNCR is being employed, a target

emission requirement for nitric oxides applies of 70 mg/m 03

(calculated as NO 2 ). The level of reduction achievable

using SNCR and the emission concentration to be quoted in

the permit must be determined through research. Also, the

possibility of ammonia slipping through must be considered.

The total emissions of acid equivalents due to the emission

of NH 3 and NO x must be kept as low as possible. In this

context the rule applies that 1 kg of NH 3 is equivalent to

2.7 kg of NO x .

_Monitoring of emissions_
The emissions must be monitored in accordance with

the general provisions of §.. Supplementary to this
the rule applies for emissions of polychlorinated
dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans that it must be

demonstrated by means of an annual measurement
that the concentration standard is being complied
with.

**F7** **Installations for the**

**incineration of**

**uncontaminated wood and**
**wood parings**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in June ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

These regulations are applicable to the incineration of
uncontaminated wood parings in installations with a
thermal power of up to . th .
In this context uncontaminated wood parings are
pieces of wood (sawdust, shavings, chips, parings, sheet
materials, etc.) that do not contain any contaminants
(paint, laminating materials, wood preservation
products, etc.) which, due to their composition, may
give rise to elevated emissions that are harmful to the
environment in case of incineration. The regulations
are not applicable to installations for the incineration
of waste wood as described in the Environmental

Protection Act ( _Wet Milieubeheer_ ) (e.g. wood from
demolition activities, wood parings collected on a
regional basis, etc.).

Where uncontaminated wood parings are incinerated
the goal must be to use the energy released, for
example, for space heating or for industrial processes.

These regulations are applicable for every mass flow of
the substances mentioned. There is no lower threshold

value for the mass flow. The emission requirements are
not based on the mass flow limit but on the total
thermal power (in  th ) of the installations for the
incineration of uncontaminated wood parings installed
at the facility.
The emission requirements quoted below assume a
reference oxygen content of % in the waste gas.

_Particulates_

In the case of a total thermal power:

- smaller than or equal to . th, an emission
requirement of  mg/m  applies;

- of between . th and . th, an emission
requirement of  mg/m  applies;

- of between . th and . th, an emission
requirement of  mg/m  applies.

**Standards for particulate matter**

An emission value of under 100 mg/m 03, for example, can

be realised by an optimal design of the furnace together

with the use of a multi-stage cyclone (dimensioned to

achieve a level of 100 mg/m 03 .

An emission value of under 50 mg/m 03, or under 25 mg/m 03

for installations with a capacity in excess of 1.5 MW th, can be

realised by an optimal design of the furnace together with the

use of a single field electrostatic filter.

_Carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic_
_hydrocarbons (_ _PAH_ _s), odour nuisance_
The emission of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and
s must be limited by carrying out operations in
such a way that effective incineration (i.e. complete
combustion) can be guaranteed. In order to achieve
effective incineration the installations must be

dimensioned and operated in accordance with the
conditions quoted below. In addition, in the case of a
total thermal power of between . th and . th
the emission requirements quoted below for carbon
monoxide and hydrocarbons must also be met.

_Limiting conditions_
The capacity of the installation must be geared to the
practical use that the operator expects to be able to
make of the energy released by incinerating the wood
parings. Furthermore, any installation-specific
instructions issued by the manufacturer or the supplier
ensure complete combustion must be included in the
permit requirements. Also, to the extent that this does
not contradict any installation-specific instructions, the
following aspects must be addressed in concrete form:

- implementing a maintenance schedule for the
installation that has been approved by the competent
authorities, for example in the form of a
maintenance contract with the manufacturer or

supplier of the installation or with an independent
body authorised to perform such work;

- strict adherence to the instructions for using the
installation (as regards the quantity of wood, the
moisture content of the wood, the amount of excess

air, etc.);

- fine tuning of automatic combustion control units,
if present, in accordance with the instructions;

- adapting the quantity of combustion air fed into the
installation (if it is not being used to full capacity).

**Automatic combustion control units**

In general, in the case of installations with an automatic

combustion control unit complete combustion can be

ensured by employing a modulating control system for the

fuel to air ratio. Using such a control system continually

optimises the amounts of combustion air and fuel in relation

to each other.

_Emission requirements_
In the case of a total thermal power of between
. th and . th the emission requirements
quoted below for carbon monoxide and total
hydrocarbons must be met:

- total hydrocarbons: an emission requirement applies
of  mg/m  (calculated total hydrocarbons);

- carbon monoxide: an emission requirement of
maximum  mg/m  applies.

**Emission requirements for installations of less than**

**1.5 MW** **th** **output**

In the case of a total thermal power of less than 1.5 MWth,

it is not necessary to lay down emission requirements for

total hydrocarbons and for carbon monoxide. Assuming

complete combustion, it will be possible to achieve an

emission concentration for carbon monoxide of less than

2000 mg/m 03 . In the case of emission concentrations in

excess of 2000 mg/m 03 it can be concluded that the

requirement of complete combustion is not being met.

**PAH emissions**

As long as the conditions and/or emission requirements for

CO and hydrocarbons are being met, no additional

requirements are needed to limit emissions of PAHs.

Moreover, in several cases no odour nuisance will occur so

that additional measures to limit odour nuisance will prove

unnecessary.

_NO_
_x_
Emission requirements in order to limit  x -emission
need not be made compulsory, unless the total thermal
power exceeds . th and, in addition to this, the
wood parings consist for more than -% of sheet
materials (particle board, etc.). In that case an emission
requirement of  mg/m  applies. This requirement
must be met by taking source-oriented measures.

_Interim regulation_
In the case of a total thermal power of less than
. th, the requirements of the special regulations
should have been met no later than  June , unless
the installation was erected after  June . In that
case the requirements of the special regulations must be
met at the latest  years after the time of installation.

_Monitoring of emissions_
In accordance with §. of the NeR a detailed
monitoring schedule must have been drawn up. This
means that for the verification of the standards for
particulate matter in most cases a monitoring schedule
of type # will be applicable. With a view to the
expected mass flows of carbon monoxide and
hydrocarbons, a monitoring schedule of type # must
also be adhered to for verifying whether these
requirements are being met.
Although regular mandatory inspections in the form of
separate measurements are not a feature of monitoring
schedule #, it will be necessary to demand that a
system of verification has been worked out in detail.

This system must comprise the following elements:

- A maintenance schedule for the installation approved
by the competent authorities. This maintenance
schedule (for example in the form of a maintenance
contract) must include both inspections to verify that
the conditions for complete combustion are being
met and checks to see whether the technology for
limiting particulate emissions is functioning properly.
The results of every overhaul performed on the basis
of this maintenance schedule must be logged in a
service report that must be submitted to the licensing
authority. The service report may prompt further
investigations into the emissions being released.

- In the case of a total thermal power between . th
and . th it is recommended that after
installation a measurement to ensure guaranteed
performance be carried out for particulates, carbon
monoxide and all hydrocarbons taken together; and
in the case of a total thermal power of between .
 th and . th, a measurement to ensure
guaranteed performance for particulates.

- In the case of a total thermal power of less than .
 th, it should be considered taking a measurement
to ensure guaranteed performance for particulates
carried out after first installation.

**G1** **Processing of gas emissions**
**from landfill sites, waste**

**fermentation and anaerobic**

**waste water treatment**
**plants**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in June ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Landfill sites_
The operator of the landfill site is required to take the
measures indicated in the present regulations unless he
can demonstrate that the positive effect on the
environment would be negligible. In assessing whether
measures are necessary, the composition and the mass of
the waste being dumped must be taken into
consideration, among other things. The limit mass flows
quoted in §. of the NeR are not applicable in this case.

_Fugitive emissions_
During the period in which methane is being formed
on the tip, fugitive emissions of landfill gas must be
controlled. When the tip is being built up, measures
must be taken aimed at collecting and processing these
emissions. Collecting these gases can be facilitated by,
for example, building up the tip in discrete sections. As

extracting gas must be installed and commissioned so
that the gases formed in the waste can be continuously
removed and treated.
