### Engine

Power and reliability

The Cat C13 engine with ACERT Technology gives you the

performance to maintain consistent grading speeds for

maximum productivity. Superior torque and lugging capability

pulls through sudden, short-term load increases.

ACERT Technology lowers combustion chamber temperatures

and optimizes fuel combustion to generate more work output for

your fuel cost.

Standard Optimized Variable Horse Power (VHP) is designed
to provide the ideal amount of power in all gears to effi ciently
perform diverse motor grader applications while protecting

structure and drivetrain components. Standard Optimized VHP

provides additional power in roading gears for higher speeds.

**Hydraulic Demand Fan**

The hydraulic demand fan automatically adjusts fan speed to meet
engine cooling requirements. When demand is reduced, you benefi t
from more power to the ground and improved fuel effi ciency.

**Compression Brake**

The standard three-phase compression brake enables higher

travel speeds downhill, while reducing wear on brake components.

This improves overall productivity and lowers your maintenance costs.

**Ether Starting Aid**

A standard ether starting aid helps cold-weather startups in extreme

temperatures.

### Engine Idle Shutdown Timer

This standard feature can be software-enabled by your Cat dealer

to shut down the engine after a set period of time to save you fuel

and help reduce emissions.

**6**

### Power Train

Maximum power to the ground

We designed the 16M to give you effi ciency and longevity
in your most demanding applications.

- Optional Automatic Differential Lock unlocks the differential

during a turn and re-locks when straight for easier operation

and improved power train protection.

- Full Electronic Clutch Pressure Control (ECPC) system

optimizes inching modulation for smooth shifts and

directional changes, reducing stress on gears.

- Standard Programmable Autoshift simplifi es operation by
allowing the operator to program the transmission to shift

at optimal points to match your application.

- Power Shift Countershaft Transmission is matched to the

Cat engine to maximize power to the ground.

- Eight forward and six reverse gears are specifi cally designed
to give you a wide operating range for maximum productivity

in all earthmoving applications.

- Engine Over-Speed Protection prevents downshifting until

an acceptable safe travel speed has been established.

**Front and Rear Axles**

The sealed spindle keeps front axle bearings lubricated and

protected from contaminants. The Cat “Live Spindle” design

places the larger tapered roller bearing on the outside, where

the load is greater, extending bearing life. Standard front axle

guards provide additional protection from debris and rocks
that could damage the front axle cylinder, lines, and fi ttings.

A bolt-on modular rear axle improves serviceability and

contamination control with easy access to differential

components.

**Hydraulic Brakes**

Oil-bathed multi-disc service brakes are hydraulically

actuated for smooth, predictable braking and lower operating

costs. Brakes are located at each tandem wheel for a large

total brake surface area to give you dependable stopping

power and longer life.

**7**

### Structures and Drawbar-Circle-Moldboard

Service ease and precise blade control

Caterpillar designs motor grader frame and drawbar

components to give you performance and durability in heavy

duty applications. The one-piece forged steel circle stands up
to high stress loads, and a sacrifi cial wear system helps keep
your service time and costs down.

The articulation hitch features a large tapered roller bearing

to carry loads evenly and smoothly. It is sealed to prevent

contamination and a locking pin prevents articulation for

safety during service or transport.

**Blade Angle and Moldboard**
An aggressive blade angle helps you work more effi ciently
by allowing material to roll more freely along the blade.

Heat-treated rails, hardened cutting edges and end bits,

and heavy duty bolts to give you greater moldboard reliability

and long service life. The link bar allows extreme moldboard

positioning for easier bank sloping and ditch cutting/cleaning.

**Easy Maintenance for More Uptime**

A series of shims, patented top-adjust wear strips and wear

inserts are easy to add or replace. This keeps drawbar-circle
moldboard components factory-tight for higher quality work,

and saves you service time and costs. A single-piece shimmable

blade rail wear strip as well as bronze drawbar and circle

shoe wear strips helps improve the durability of the drawbar,

circle, moldboard in mining applications.

**8**

### Hydraulics

Advanced machine control

State-of-the-art electro-hydraulics gives you advanced

machine controls with precise and predictable movements.

**Load Sensing Hydraulics (PPPC)**

A proven load-sensing system and advanced Proportional
Priority Pressure-Compensating (PPPC) electro-hydraulic

valves give you superior implement control and enhanced
machine performance. Continuously matching hydraulic fl ow/
pressure to power demands creates less heat and reduces

power consumption.

- Consistent, Predictable Movement - PPPC valves have different
fl ow rates for the head and rod ends of the cylinder, so you
can count on consistent, predictable implement response.

- Balanced Flow - Hydraulic fl ow is proportioned to give you
confi dence that all implements will operate simultaneously
without slowing the engine or speed of some implements.

**Blade Float**

Allows the blade to move freely under its own weight. By fl oating both
cylinders, the blade can follow the contours of the haul road. Floating only

one cylinder permits the toe of the blade to follow a hard surface while

the operator controls the slope with the other lift cylinder. An optional

Variable Down Pressure feature allows you to select the amount of down
force when the blade is in fl oat. This helps you extend cutting edge life
and is effective for removing snow and mud from a road surface.

**Independent Oil Supply**

Large, separate hydraulic oil supplies prevent cross-contamination and

provide proper oil cooling, which reduces heat build-up and extends

component life. Cat XTTM hose allows high pressures for maximum power

and reduced downtime.

**9**

**Cat Grade Control**

Cat Grade Control Cross Slope is a standard, fully integrated, factory installed

grade control system that helps your operator more easily maintain desired

cross slope by automatically controlling one side of the blade. The system is

job-ready from day one, and scalable for the future with AccuGradeTM upgrade

kits that provide additional 2D and/or 3D control features.
