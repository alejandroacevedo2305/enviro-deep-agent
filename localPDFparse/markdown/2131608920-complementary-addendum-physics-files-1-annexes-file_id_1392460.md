-->

opper (Cu) is an essential trace element that can be
toxic to aquatic biota at elevated concentrations.
# C Copper enters aquatic systems through aerial

deposition or surface runoff. Because of its affinity for
particulate matter, mainly fractions of iron, manganese
oxides, and organic matter, Cu tends to accumulate in
sediments (Campbell and Tessier 1996). Because a variety
of organisms live in, or are in contact with, bed sediments,
sediments act as an important route of exposure to aquatic
organisms. Canadian interim sediment quality guidelines
(ISQGs) and probable effect levels (PELs) for Cu can be
used to evaluate the degree to which adverse biological
effects are likely to occur as a result of exposure to Cu in
sediments.

Canadian ISQGs and PELs for Cu were developed using a
modification of the National Status and Trends Program
approach as described in CCME (1995) (Table 1). The
ISQGs and PELs refer to total concentrations of Cu in
surficial sediments (i.e., top 5 cm), as quantified by
digestion with a strong acid (e.g., aqua regia, nitric acid,
or hydrochloric acid) followed by determination by a
standard analytical protocol.

The majority of the data used to derive ISQGs and PELs
for Cu are from studies on field-collected sediments that
measured concentrations of Cu, along with concentrations
of other chemicals, and associated biological effects, as
compiled in the Biological Effects Database for Sediments
(BEDS) (Environment Canada 1998). The Cu data sets for
freshwater and marine sediments are large, with the
freshwater data set containing 116 effect entries and
370 no-effect entries and the marine data set containing
105 effect entries and 335 no-effect entries (Figures 1
and 2). The BEDS represents a wide range of
concentrations, types of sediment, and mixtures of
chemicals. Evaluation of the percentage of effect entries
for Cu that are below the ISQGs, between the ISQGs and
the PELs, and above the PELs (Figures 1 and 2) indicates
that these values define three ranges of chemical
concentrations: those that are rarely, occasionally, and
frequently associated with adverse biological effects,
respectively (Environment Canada 1998).

**Toxicity**

Adverse biological effects for Cu in the BEDS include
decreased benthic invertebrate diversity, reduced
abundance, increased mortality, and behavioural changes,

among others (Environment Canada 1998, Appendixes IIa
and IIb). For example, snails, a relatively sensitive
gastropod, were less abundant at locations in the Niagara
River, Ontario, where the mean concentration in
sediments was 52.2 mg·kg [-1], compared to sites with
concentrations of 26.0 mg·kg [-1] Cu, which is less than the
ISQG (Jaagumagi 1988). In marine sediments, Ferraro et
al. (1991) reported that the abundance of echinoderms
(e.g., starfish and sea urchins) at Palos Verdes, California,
was low in sediments where the mean concentration was
109 mg·kg [-1], whereas abundance was high in sediments
with 18.0 mg·kg [-1] Cu, which is below the marine ISQG.

Spiked-sediment toxicity tests for Cu report the onset of
toxicity to benthic organisms at higher concentrations than
those observed in field studies. This is likely a result of
the shorter exposure times used in laboratory studies, as
well as exposure to Cu only as opposed to chemical
mixtures containing Cu (Environment Canada 1998). For
example, 14-d LC 50 s were 380 mg·kg [-1] for _Hyalella_
_azteca_, a freshwater amphipod, which is approximately
double the freshwater PEL, while 10-d LC 50 s for
_Chironomus tentans_, a midge, were approximately six times
the freshwater PEL (i.e., 1110 mg·kg [-1] ) (Milani et al. 1996).
Similarly, 48-d LC 25 s for _Protothaca staminea_, a marine
clam, occurred at a concentration of 38.2 mg·kg [-1], which is
twice the marine ISQG (Phelps et al. 1985).

In sublethal spiked-sediment toxicity tests, growth of a
freshwater amphipod, _H. azteca_, and a midge, _C. tentans_,
was significantly reduced at concentrations of
89.8 mg·kg [-1] and 496 mg·kg [-1], respectively (Milani et al.
1996). Other freshwater spiked-sediment toxicity tests did
not demonstrate adverse effects at concentrations of Cu
that were known to occur in aquatic environments
(Environment Canada 1998). Sublethal effects of Cu to
marine organisms in spiked-sediment toxicity tests include
delayed predator avoidance response (i.e., burial) in the
clams _P. staminea_ and _Mya arenaria_ . Although

burial time increased for _P. staminea_ at a concentration of
4.4 mg·kg [-1] Cu, which is below the marine ISQG,
statistically significant differences in reburial times
were measured at concentrations between 13.6 and
23.4 mg·kg [-1] (Phelps et al. 1985).

The toxicity of Cu in sediments can be mitigated by various
sediment fractions (Environment Canada 1998). For
example, Malueg et al. (1986) observed higher LC 50 s for
_Daphnia magna_ when peat (i.e., organic matter) was added
to the system. Similarly, Austen et al. (1994) observed a
higher abundance of nematodes in sediment having high
organic matter content when compared to sediments low in
organic matter, with similar dosages of Cu. These results
suggest that organic matter may decrease the toxicity of Cu
to freshwater and marine benthic organisms.

Results of both marine and freshwater spiked-sediment
toxicity tests indicate that concentrations of Cu that are
associated with adverse effects are consistently above the
ISQGs, confirming that these guidelines represent
concentrations below which adverse biological effects will
rarely occur. Further, these studies provide additional
evidence that toxic levels of Cu in sediments are similar to
the PELs, confirming that adverse effects are more likely
to be observed when concentrations of Cu exceed the
PELs. The ISQGs and PELs for Cu are therefore expected
to be valuable tools for assessing the ecotoxicological
relevance of concentrations of Cu in sediments.

**Concentrations**

Concentrations of Cu in marine and freshwater sediments
vary substantially across Canada (Environment Canada
1998). In the National Geochemical Reconnaissance
(NGR) program database by the Geological Survey of
Canada (GSC) (Friske and Hornbrook 1991), the mean
background concentrations in Canadian lake and stream

$ $
sediments are 31 mg kg [-1] and 32 mg kg [-1], respectively
(P.W.B. Friske 1996, GSC, Ottawa, pers. com.). When
compared to the background concentrations of Cu in the
combined lake and stream NGR database (n = 84 089), the
freshwater ISQG and PEL for Cu fall at the 74th and
98.44th percentiles, respectively (R.G. Garrett 1997, GSC,
Ottawa, pers. com.). This demonstrates that background
concentrations of Cu across most of Canada are lower than
the ISQG of 35.7 mg·kg [-1] . In marine systems, mean
background concentrations of Cu, estimated from deep
layers of sediment cores (>10 cm) from a variety of
published sources, ranged from 4.5 to 123 mg·kg [-1] (i.e.,
below the marine ISQG to slightly greater than the marine
PEL) (Environment Canada 1998).

Concentrations of Cu in surficial sediments close to point
sources of contamination frequently exceed estimates of

background concentrations (Environment Canada 1998).
For example, mean concentrations in sediments as high as
1 581 mg·kg [-1] have been measured in freshwater lakes
near mining and smelting operations and as high as
440 mg·kg [-1] in marine harbours receiving various
industrial inputs (Environment Canada 1998).

**Additional Considerations**

Regardless of the origin of Cu in sediments, aquatic
organisms may be adversely affected by exposure to
elevated levels. The occurrence of adverse biological
effects cannot be precisely predicted from concentration
data alone, particularly in the concentration ranges
between the ISQGs and PELs (Figures 1 and 2). The
likelihood of adverse biological effects occurring in
response to Cu exposure at a particular site depends on the
sensitivity of individual species and endpoints examined,
as well as a variety of physicochemical (e.g., pH, redox
potential, and particle size), biological (e.g., feeding
behaviour and uptake rates), and geochemical (e.g., organic
matter, metal oxide, and sulphide) factors that affect the
bioavailability of Cu (Environment Canada 1998).

Benthic organisms are exposed to particulate and
dissolved Cu in interstitial and overlying waters, as well as
to sediment-bound Cu through surface contact and
sediment ingestion. Dissolved forms of Cu are believed to
be the most readily bioavailable (Campbell and Tessier
1996). Copper associated with sediment fractions that
exhibit cation-exchange capacity or with fractions that
are easily reduced is generally more bioavailable
(Environment Canada 1998). Furthermore, changes in
ambient environmental conditions (e.g., sediment
turbation, decrease in pH, and increase in redox potential)
can increase the bioavailability of Cu associated with
inorganic solid phases, oxides of iron and manganese, and
organic matter. In contrast, Cu that is bound within the
crystalline lattices of clay and some other minerals that are
associated with acid-extractable or residual sediment
fractions is generally considered to be the least
bioavailable. Once Cu is ingested, its availability depends
on various factors, including enzyme activity and gut pH
(Environment Canada 1998).

Models have been proposed to predict metal uptake (and
hence toxicity) in aquatic organisms from bed sediments.
One model that has been proposed considers the role of
acid volatile sulphide (AVS) in modifying the
bioavailability of two simultaneously extractable metals
(SEM), cadmium and nickel in anoxic sediments (Di Toro
et al. 1992). This model is applicable to Cu and other
metals that form sulphides. Acid volatile sulphide refers to
the fraction of the sediment that contains a reactive pool
of solid-phase sulphide that is available to bind divalent

metals and thus render them unavailable for uptake by
aquatic biota. The model predicts that when the molar
ratio of SEM to AVS in sediments is <1, metals will not
be bioavailable due to complexation with available
sulphide. When the ratio is >1, bioavailability of SEM is
predicted to be high. However, when the ratio is >1, the
model has several limitations, as it does not take into
account the importance of other binding phases that will
also limit the bioavailability of a metal (Ankley et al.
1993; Hare et al. 1994; Environment Canada 1998). In
addition to geochemical factors, further research should
be directed at determining other factors that modify the
bioavailability of Cu (e.g., physical, chemical, and
biological factors). This information, along with the
recommended ISQGs and PELs, should be considered in
site-specific assessments of Cu in sediments.

Currently, the degree to which Cu will be bioavailable at
particular sites cannot be predicted conclusively from the
physicochemical characteristics of sediments or the
attributes of endemic organisms (Environment Canada
1998). An extensive review of available toxicological data
indicates that the incidence of adverse biological effects
associated with Cu exposure increases as concentrations
of Cu increase in a range of sediment types (Figures 1
and 2). Therefore, the recommended Canadian ISQGs and
PELs for Cu will be useful in assessing the
ecotoxicological significance of Cu in sediments.
