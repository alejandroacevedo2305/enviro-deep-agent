CSGaaaS2-72(aaa=350W-375W)

Over 30 years manufacturing experience, the complete

PV chain including silicon materials, wafer, solar

glass,solar cell, solar module and solar project, and

IS09001 &ISO14001 certified factory, ensure excellent

raw materials and production control.

Solar modules certified by TUV Rheinland (IEC61215&

IEC61730) in the extreme conditions (Temperature, load,

impact) with good performance.

The good weak light performance (morning, evening and

cloudy days) has been tested and approved by

professional third-party.

Guarantee from 0 to +6W as power tolerance, customer

can obtain 5.8% power more than conventional output.

100% EL test before and after lamination, and finished

products EL test, providing higher quality assurance.

# High Efficiency PERC Mono-Crystalline Solar Module

Warranty:For a period of 25 years commencing on the

warranty start date, loss of power output of the nominal

power output measured at STC for the products shall not

exceed:

1. For polycrystalline products: 2.5% in first year, therefore
0.7% per year, ending with 80.7% in the 25 [th] year.

2. For monocrystalline products:3% in first year, therefore
0.708% per year, ending with 80% in the 25 [th] year.
