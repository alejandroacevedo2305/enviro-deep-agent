 **SECTION3- HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION**

Emergency Overview: warning, non-demolition, not exposed to flame or fire. There is the risk of

explosion and burn under fire conditions.

Do not short-circuit, squeezing, burning, or removing the module.

|Potential health hazards|Col2|
|---|---|
|Risk Categories|None|
|Invasive Ways|None|
|Environmental Hazards|Pb<0.01%|
|Health Hazards|None|
|Explosion Hazard|Tempered glass has a 1/10000 explosion risk|
|The inverter device does not meet the provision, the flaws on system design, the quality problem<br>of the junction box, the hot spot effect will be the reason of spontaneous combustion of this<br>product.|The inverter device does not meet the provision, the flaws on system design, the quality problem<br>of the junction box, the hot spot effect will be the reason of spontaneous combustion of this<br>product.|

 **SECTION4- FIRST AID MEASURES**

|Type of contact|Measures|
|---|---|
|Eye contact|No damage found on eye contact, no special provisions|
|Skin contact|No skin contact injury found. It is proposed to wash hands before and after<br>touch back sheet. If molten polymer contacts skin, immediately cool it with<br>cold water, and do not directly peel them from the skin, go to hospital for<br>treatment by burns drugs.|

|Col1|MSDS Report|
|---|---|
|Ingestion|No damage found, no special provisions.|
|Inhalation|No damage found, no special provisions. If you have overheating or fire<br>hazard, be away from heat. Go to hospital if any discomfort.|

 **SECTION5- FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES**

|In general|During normal operation, this product is not prone to burning.|
|---|---|
|Hazardous<br>Combustion Products|CO, HF|
|Extinguishing Media|The hydrogen produced under the using of water may be mixed with air<br>to form an explosive mixture if the module is burning. For small fires,<br>carbon dioxide, dry powder or foam extinguishing agent are preferred<br>medium. But they may not work to the burning module until the<br>combustion module will be completely burned out. LITH-X<br>(powdered graphite) or copper powder extinguisher, sand, dried,<br>pulverized dolomite or soda ash can also be used, and these materials<br>can be used as a smothering agent.|
|Extinguishing Note|Transfer people to a safe area in the upwind air, wear respirators,<br>protective gloves and firefighting clothing. If large amounts are inhaled,<br>give emergency medical treatment.|

|Col1|MSDS Report|
|---|---|
||4, Do not install the modules near the storage equipment and place of flammable<br>gas.|
|Electrical<br>Installation|1, A void the risk of electric shock during installation, wiring, module operating.<br>2, The module of different specifications cannot used in the same array.<br>3, The open circuit voltage of module is less than the maximum voltage of<br>standard system.<br>4, All of the module s no matter how much voltage should be grounding.<br>5, The cable is to be placed where the children and animals cannot touch.<br>6, Cables and junction boxes may overheat at high current.<br>7, Make sure junction box and wire can go through the short circuit current.<br>8, Make sure the positive and negative polarity of the cable and terminal during<br>connection.<br>9, Grounding line is provided.|
|Mechanical<br>Installation|1 Fix the modules with the installation tools and special bracket to support<br>modules.<br>2, Make sure the module can still work carrying a certain load, which is not<br>affected by the impact of the snow load or thermal expansion and contraction.<br>3, Make sure that the modules can still work in the ambient temperature within<br>the variable range of 40 to +80°C.<br>4, Off grid power generation system installed in large areas of snow, require<br>module position lower and bracket narrower|
