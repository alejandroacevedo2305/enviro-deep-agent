matches the electrical Specifications on the Fan and Motor
Decals.
2. Remove the Motor Access
Cover.
3. Install an electrical disconnect
within reach of each Fan
installed.
4. Connect the cord to the motor
according to the wiring diagram
on the motor. Verify that the
motor is connected for counter
clockwise rotation (viewing the
back of the motor, opposite the
shaft end.)
5. Follow local, state, and national
electrical codes for wiring.
6. Attach the Cord to the Wall using
a Screwhook **as shown** . Allow
enough slack in the cord to form
a "drip loop" for moisture to fall
away from the cord and not into
the motor.

### Maintenance

**IMPORTANT!** Disconnect Power Prior To Maintaining Or Cleaning The Fan. The fan may start automatically causing
serious injury or death.

- Service and repair of fans should be done only by a qualified technician.

- Minimize contact of moisture or corrosive chemicals to the surfaces of the fan components to maximize fan life.

- After washing fans, operate fans long enough to remove moisture from all fan surfaces.

- Keep the fan clean for maximum life and best performance. **Do Not spray water on the Fan Shaft Bearings, the Belt**
**Tensioner, or the Motor.**

- Periodically check the V-Belt and replace if necessary. A worn Belt will cause a substantial drop in Fan performance or
it can break and cause Fan failure. If a Belt rides below the Sheave edge, replace the belt. **(See below)**

**Bad Belt (Needs Replaced)**

**Good Belt** **Bad Belt**

- Check Belt Tension. The Belt should be
tensioned just tight enough to minimize
Belt slippage. Over tensioning the belt will
cause premature Belt and Bearing wear.
With a new Belt the Middle Idler Sheave

indicator mark should fall between the 3rd
and 4th notch of the Housing **as shown** .

- The motor and Fan Shaft Bearings are pre- **Forth**
lubricated. Grease zerks are provided on **Notch**
the fan shaft bearings for installations **Third**
where re-lubrication is needed. Add only a **Notch**
small amount of grease to purge impurities
out of the bearing seals. Use only high
quality lithium soap base grease and clean
all dirt from zerk before applying grease.
Chore-Time recommends using Shell
Alvania # 2 in the fan shaft bearings.

- Check Sheaves for wear. Replace if a Sheave groove is worn.
