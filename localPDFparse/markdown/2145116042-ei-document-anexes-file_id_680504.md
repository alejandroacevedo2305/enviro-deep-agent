#### 330D L Ultra-high Demolition
##### _Heavy-Duty and purpose built for your demolition job._

**Upper Frame and Counterweight**
The heavy-duty upper frame handles increased loads and
movements. Additional counterweight provides maximum
stability throughout the recommended working range.

**Undercarriage**
Different undercarriage options are available to match your
performance and transportation needs.

**Engine**
The Cat [®] C9 engine with ACERTTMTechnology offers better
fuel efficiency and reduced wear. It works at the point of
combustion to optimize engine performance and provide low
exhaust emissions. By combining ACERT Technology with
the new Economy Mode and Power Management, customers
can balance the demands of performance and fuel economy to
suit their requirements and application.

**Serviceability**
Longer service intervals and easier maintenance result in better
machine availability and lower owning and operating costs.

**Booms, Sticks and Work Tools**
The 330D Ultra-high demolition is equipped with a reliable
and safe boom hook system that significantly reduces the time
needed to change the front parts, providing increased uptime,
production and versatility. To further increase the machine’s
versatility, various front part options are available. Besides the
Ultra-high demolition configuration, a short two position
retrofit boom nose as well as a long reach excavation front are
available. To complete the configuration, purposely designed
Caterpillar work tools are available.

**Operator Station**
The safe, roomy, quiet, automatically climate controlled
tiltable cab has excellent sightlines to the work tool
to help keep operator fatigue low and production up
throughout the entire shift.

**Complete Customer Service**
Your Cat dealer offers a wide range
of services that can be set up under a customer support
agreement when you purchase your equipment. The dealer
will help you choose a plan that can cover everything from
machine and attachment selection to replacement.

#### Upper Frame and Counterweight
##### _Purposely designed and built for extreme conditions._

**Reinforced Upper Frame.** The heavy-duty reinforced
upper frames of the Cat UHD models are designed
to withstand the extreme load conditions of

demolition applications. Compared to a
standard upper frame, several additional
plates provide the durability and strength
required in these environments.

**Counterweight.**
A heavier counterweight
balances the swing
bearing and provides
enhanced stability.

2

**Standard** **Heavy-duty**

**Swing Bearing to Upper Frame Bolts.**
The swing bearing bolts are 20 mm longer on
the back half of upper frame for increased joint
retention. Bolt grade is increased from 10.9 to
11.9 for increased bolt torque of swing bearing
to upper frame and carbody.

#### Undercarriage
##### _Durable undercarriage absorbs stresses and provides excellent stability._

work platform.

**Long Narrow Undercarriage.** The long
and narrow undercarriage (LN) provides
the best choice when ease of transport
is important while maintaining excellent
performance.

**Hydraulic Variable Gauge**
**Undercarriage.** The hydraulic variable
gauge undercarriage (HVG) increases
the stability through increased track
gauge in working position as well as by
lowering the center of gravity of the
machine. The non-bolt joint allows a
change from shipping to working width,
or reverse, in less than a minute. The
hydraulic variable gauge undercarriage
provides a shipping width of 3000 mm
and a working width of 3420 mm
(with 600 mm shoes).

**Heavy Duty High Wide Undercarriage.**
The heavy-duty high wide undercarriage
(HDHW) provides an increased overthe-side stability as well as increased
ground clearance. Thicker carbody
plates, plus larger box-section height
team up to provide superior joint
retention and durability in demolition
applications.

**ES - Extreme Service Under-**
**carriage (345C L).** The 330D
Ultra-high demolition can also be
equipped with an upsized undercarriage. The 345C variable gauge
heavy-duty, H-shaped long undercarriage provides ease of transport
and a stable platform when working
on a variety of sites. Another benefit
of the 345C undercarriage is the
increased ground clearance.
With 600 mm track shoes, the track

roller frames can be retracted to

a transport width of less than three

meters.

**Tracks.** The 330D comes standard with

grease lubricated tracks. The track links
are assembled and sealed with grease to
decrease internal bushing wear, reduce
travel noise and extend service life

lowering operating costs.

#### Booms and Sticks and Work Tools
##### _Maximum versatility gets the best out of your machine._

**Boom Hook System.** The front parts are
equipped with a reliable and safe hook system
between the boom foot and boom nose.

Compared to the traditional pin-mounted joint,
the hook system significantly reduces the time
needed to change between the Ultra-high front
parts and the short retrofit configuration,
or the long-reach excavation configuration.
In principle, the boom hook system consists of
a hook system to pick up the front parts and a
mechanical expander pin to secure these front
parts onto the boom foot. The absence of any
hydraulic parts, as well as a full length heavy
duty one-piece securing pin, ensure a safe
and reliable operation. The operator has
an excellent view of the hook system from
the cab to ease changing the front parts.

**Retrofit Capability.** A short boom nose can be
hooked onto the boom foot. To maximize

the machine’s extreme versatility, this boom
nose can be put in two positions. The straight
position is ideal for working in above ground
level applications, such as low level demolition or sorting, and the bent position can be
used for applications such as digging or truck
loading. For long-reach digging and extracting
applications, a two-piece long reach excavation front is available. This long reach front
is also equipped with the boom-hook system
as well as the hydraulic quick disconnects,
ensuring a fast change of front parts.
Optional medium pressure lines enable
the use of tilting buckets.

4

**Hydraulic Quick Disconnects.**
The hydraulic lines between boom foot
and boom nose are fitted with hydraulic
quick disconnects to even further reduce
the time needed to change the front parts.
Oil spillage and contamination is reduced
through the quick disconnects flat-face
design. New generation face-to-face ball
valves are installed on auxiliary high
pressure lines for an unmatched reliability.

**Dedicated Ultra-High Demolition Linkage.**
Because Ultra-high demolition applications require a different working envelop
than standard applications, a purpose
designed linkage is standard on the Ultrahigh demolition front parts. Besides
providing an optimized working envelop,
this linkage also greatly improves
controllability in nearly every position.

**Tool Cylinder Protection.** To prevent
damage to the tool cylinder rod caused
by falling concrete and debris, the tool
cylinder is equipped with a heavy duty
metal cover. Thanks to its unique
construction, the cover protects the
cylinder rod in every position.

**Lowering Control Devices.** For increased
safety and controllability lowering control
devices are installed on boom, stick and
tool cylinders. SmartBoom is standard on
the 330D L UHD.

**Multi-Processors.** The Caterpillar
Multi-Processors can be equipped
with different jaw types depending
on your need.

O CC-jaws combi cutter.

O CR-jaws concrete crusher.

O PP-jaws primary pulveriser.

O PS-jaws secondary pulveriser.

O TS-jaws tank shear.

O S-jaws steel.

**Demolition and Sorting Grapples.**
The demolition and sorting grapple
with unlimited left and right rotation
is the ideal tool for stripping, sorting,
handling and loading.

**Demolition Shears.** These shears can

grab and pick material from a pile
easily, without requiring movement
of the base carrier. They are very
efficient tools because of the high
force to weight ratio. The blades are
made of exceptionally long-wear
alloy steel and have proven speed
valves that improve cycle times.

#### Operator Station
##### _Designed for comfort, safety and ease of operation._

**Hydraulically Tiltable Cab.**
The hydraulically tiltable cab tilts
back from 0 to 30 degrees to further
improve upward visibility and
allows the operator to adopt a more
comfortable body position.
The tiltable cab is integrated into
the upper frame and therefore does
not increase the machine’s shipping
height. Because of the integration
into the upper frame, no tilt parts
are exposed to the demolition
environment. To reduce vibrations

and sound the cab shell is attached

to the frame with viscous mounts.

**Climate Control.** Positive filtered

ventilation with a pressurized cab is
standard. Fresh air or re-circulated air

can be selected with a switch on

the right console.

**Controls.** The 330D uses pilot
operated control levers, positioned so
the operator can operate with arms on
the armrests. The vertical stroke is

longer than the horizontal, reducing
operator fatigue. The control lever
grips are shaped to fit into the
operator’s hands. The horn switch and
one-touch low idle switch are

positioned on the left and right grip.

**Implement Controls.** Easy to handle
joysticks with integrated push buttons
and sliding switches control all
implement and swing functions.
The sliding switches provide
modulated control for hydromechanical tools and are designed
to increase operator comfort and
reduce operator fatigue.

**High Visibility Cab.** The laminated safety
glass front window is one-piece with a
bottom mounted parallel wiper for excellent
visibility. For enhanced upward visibility
the increased impact resistant top window
extends completely to the rear and has a
wiper and washer. The upper left side door
window can slide open. The lower window
provides visibility to the tracks and to the
ground next to the machine. The rear
window offers a good view behind and to
the left, aided by a lower hood profile.

**Falling Object Guard.** An ISO 10262
certified falling object guard on top and
front of the cab is standard. The crossbars

of the top guard are angled in line with the
operator’s sight for enhanced visibility of
the work tool. The front guard swings out
for easier windshield cleaning.
