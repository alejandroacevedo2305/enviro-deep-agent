New approaches are of crucial importance to evaluate and minimize the odorous impact in the management of organic waste. The objective of this study is to develop an odor map to identify the highest
critical odor points in an urban waste treatment plant from the physico-chemical, respirometric and
olfactometric variables evaluated in different emission sources. Fresh organic waste such as sewage
sludge (SL) and organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) were found to be the most influential
odorous substrates (14.57 and 2.41 ou E /s$m [2], respectively), due to their high concentration in biodegradable organic matter. Compost derived from both fresh organic materials (C-SL and C-OFMSW) were
the least influential substrates in terms of odor emission (  0.1 ou E /s$m [2] ) as a consequence of their
stabilization. Inorganic waste (IW) showed an odor potential as high as 2.10 ou E /s$m [2], similar to OFMSW,
due to the organic material adhered to IW surface emits high amount of unpleasant odors. Leachate
lagoons (LIX) were classified as middle critical emission points (0.7 ou E /s$m [2] ), because of the high
mineralization of nitrogen in the form of ammonical nitrogen. Moreover, the emission sources were
clearly grouped according to their physico-chemical and respirometric characteristics by principal
component analysis (PCA) and a value as high as 67.3% of the total variance was explained. Finally, odor
emission was predicted from the physico-chemical and respirometric variables by multivariate regression, with respirometric variables (OD 20 and SOUR), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammoniacal nitrogen
(N-NH 4 [þ] ) and the residence time (t) being the most influential variables on the prediction correlation
(r 1⁄4 0.9768). SL and OFMSW contributed 60% and 15%, respectively, to the global odor emission derived
from the treatment plant, followed by IW (13%) and LIX (11%).

Nowadays waste management is an assumed concern in
developed country societies, not only because of the importance of
waste recycling and valorization, but also due to the need of
minimizing environmental impacts. The amount of waste generated in urban areas, which is subsequently received in waste
management plants, has increased in recent years mainly due to
the population growth. In addition to the marked increase in the
generation of waste, its diversity, polluting capacity, dangerousness
and environmental impact should be considered to implement an
appropriate management strategy (Oliveira et al., 2017). The main
problem in the generation and disposal of waste can be addressed
in diverse ways such as reduction of waste, storage, recycling,
among others. Adamovi [] c et al. (2017) reported that an appropriate

M. Toledo et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 210 (2019) 1098e1108 1099

management system for human wastes is of vital importance to
prevent environmental pollution. Consequently, it is necessary to
improve the separation techniques to meet the requirements
stablished in current legislation.
On the other hand, the coexistence of waste treatment and urban settlements is a source of problematic interactions which
needs to be evaluated from an odorous impact point of view. Biological and physico-chemical treatments emit potential toxic
compounds such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), volatile
sulfur compounds (VSCs) and nuisance odors, which influence the
local environment negatively (He et al., 2018; Palmiotto et al., 2014;
Schiavon et al., 2017). Among the different techniques to treat
organic waste at industrial scale, composting is an aerobic biological process carried out in the presence of sufficient humidity to
ensure the transformation of organic waste into a sanitized organic
amendment highly assimilable for soils (Renaud et al., 2017).
Odor is currently classified as an atmospheric pollutant which
should be minimized in order to reduce the odorous impact. In this
context, it is worth noting that the treatment of organic waste is not
free of certain impacts. In a waste management plant (WMP), odor
emission might derive from different sources and areas, including
the waste treatment area, landfill, leachate collection points and/or
inorganic waste reception. Specifically, organic waste treatment is
characterized by the generation of offensive odors depending on
the type of raw material (Toledo et al., 2018a). Wu et al. (2017)
evaluated the odor contribution and its correlation with the odor
concentration from landfill. However, the odorous impact derived
from the reception of inorganic waste in a WMP has not been
previously reported in literature. In general, modern society produces garbage, which mainly consists of organic fractions, followed
by recyclable inorganic waste such as plastic, paper and cardboard.
Hazardous inorganic waste need to be separated to avoid soil
pollution and the contamination of compost products that are
produced in the waste management plants (Aprilia et al., 2013).
In literature, the odor emission derived from WMPs has been
evaluated using different techniques or a combination of them.
Schauberger et al. (2011) applied an inverse dispersion technique to
determine the odor emission rate from pollution sources. Giungato
et al. (2016) studied the odor emitted in a WMP by using a combination of electronic nose, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and dynamic olfactometry. Henault-Ethier et al. (2017) []
designed a dynamic system model considering odor emission factors and taking into account social, economic and environmental
consequences. However, to the best of our knowledge the specific
evaluation of the odor emission from the different pollution sources in a WMP and their specific contribution through a ready-made
odor map to locate the critical odor areas have not been previously
evaluated.
This study quantifies by dynamic olfactometry the odor concentration derived from different odorous sources of an urban

WMP with the aim of developing an odor map showing the most
critical points. This type of evaluation might allow the appropriate
allocation of the most odorous areas and to develop effective
segregation strategies or techniques for odor mitigation in the
context of urban environment. Moreover, physico-chemical characterization of odorous substrates combined with statistical anal
ysis was carried out in order to find the most influential variables
on odor emission under the study conditions.

## 2. Materials and methods

This study was carried out in the urban WMP located in Cordoba
(Andalusia, Spain), which is managed by the municipal company
Saneamientos de Cordoba S.A. (SADECO). This WMP has a strategic []
plan to select and segregate the urban solid waste in order to

minimize its environmental and social impact and to favor the
recycling of inorganic waste. In this sense, the reduction of waste to
be disposed in landfill is the short-term desirable objective.

### 2.1. Distribution of the urban WMP

The WMP is divided into different facilities depending on the
segregation treatment and type of waste. The classification facility
consists of two reception areas (reception of organic and inorganic
waste), both with a surface of 300 m [2], from which waste is fed into
two treatment lines equipped with sensors as automated selection
system. The sludge reception area (200 m [2] ) collects fresh and
dewatered sewage sludge (SL) from a wastewater treatment plant
(WWTP). SL is subsequently mixed with bulking agent to be treated
by composting. The composting area is divided into two different
fermentation areas depending on the type of waste to be composted: organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and SL.
The surface of the composting area for OFMSW is 250 m [2], while
180 m [2] are available for composting SL. In both cases, compost is
placed in piles or windrows which are regularly subjected to
turning process. The turning process is carried out twice a week
during the intensive phase of microbiological degradation (hydrolytic stage) and once every two weeks during the maturity stage.
Finally, the WMP consists of three lagoons (250 m [2], 1500 m [3] each)
to collect the landfill leachate, flushing water, vehicle washing and
rainwater. This system allows reusing the leachate enriched with
organic matter for wetting the composting piles, which avoids
wastewater treatment and minimizes irrigation costs. It is important to highlight that the landfill bodies are located 400 m from the
treatment plant and separated by tree barriers to mitigate the
odorous gases emitted.

### 2.2. Physico-chemical characterization of the odor emission sources

Physico-chemical characterization of the liquid and solid samples was carried out following different methodologies in function
of the type of waste. Samples were collected at different times,
considering OFMSW and SL as fresh for sampling times within the

e
range 0 10 d and compost of organic fraction of municipal solid
waste (C-OFMSW) and compost of sewage sludge (C-SL) at
10e210 d. It is important to highlight that the composition of the
municipal solid waste (MSW) and its corresponding fractions did
not vary significantly with respect to the season of the year. In this
sense, Arcos et al. (2008) showed that urban waste has an organic
matter content 52% in autumn, 55% in spring, 49% in spring and 59%
in summer. The same occurs for other fractions (plastic, metal, glass
and others) which present small variations with seasonal time.
The characterization of the solid samples of OFMSW, SL, COFMSW and C-SL was carried out following the methodology
proposed by The US Department of Agriculture and the US Composting Council (2002). Moisture (M, %), fixed solids (FS, %), volatile
solids (VS, %), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN, %), ammoniacal nitrogen
## (N-NH 4 [þ], %), and phosphorus content (P 2 O 5, %) were analyzed in the

solid fraction, while soluble total organic carbon (C TOC, %), soluble
total nitrogen (TN S, %), pH and conductivity (Cond, m S/cm) were
measured in the aqueous extract (1:25 v/v ratio).
On the other hand, inorganic waste (IW) was evaluated as an
important source of odor emission as it has an organic fraction
adhered to its surface. In order to characterize the organic fraction
adhered to inorganic waste an aqueous extract was carried out with
3 kg of inorganic waste and 18 kg of distilled water (3:18 w/w ratio).
In this way, inorganic waste was analyzed as a liquid sample. Thus,
the physico-chemical variables analyzed in liquid samples such as
IW and leachate (LIX) were: moisture (M, %), fixed solids (FS, %),
volatile solids (VS, %), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN, %), ammoniacal

### nitrogen (N-NH 4 [þ], %), phosphorus (P 2 O 5, %), soluble total organic

carbon (C TOC, %), soluble total nitrogen (TN S, %), pH and conductivity
(Cond, mS/cm), following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater proposed by APHA, AWWA & WEF
(2005). Supplementary materials 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 show the
complete physico-chemical characterization of OFMSW, SL, COFMSW, C-SL, IW and LIX, respectively. It is worth noting that
sampling of OFMSW, IW and LIX was more intensive due to the
heterogeneity that characterizes this type of substrates.
The physico-chemical characterization of each emission source
evaluated in the urban WMP is shown in Table 1.

### 2.3. Respirometric test

The microbiological activity of each organic waste was evaluated
through a respirometric test carried out using a static respirometer
in liquid phase at laboratory scale, which was patented by the
Department of Inorganic Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of
the University of Cordoba (P2004-02908) and developed by Chica
et al. (2003). All solid and liquid samples were evaluated in order
to measure biological oxygen consumption under standardized
conditions such as temperature (30 [] C), pH (neutral value), inhibition of nitrification (by adding thiourea) and the addition of macronutrients (ferric chloride, magnesium sulfate and calcium
chloride) to promote the mineralization of organic matter. The
device works with discontinuous aeration according to the requirements of aerobic microbial metabolism, which allows deter### mining the specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR, mg O 2 /g VS$h) and the cumulative oxygen demand (OD, mg O 2 /g SV). The evolution of

SOUR determines the reaction rate during the stabilization process
of organic matter, while OD provides information about the
biodegradability of the waste.

### 2.4. Quantification of odor emission

Odor samples were collected and analyzed according to the
European norm EN-13725 (2003) and the guideline VDI 3880
(2011). Specifically, a ventilated sampling hood and a standard
sampling device developed by Olfasense GmbH were used. The
ventilated sampling hood is used primarily for non-ventilated
sampling, being suitable for sampling of solid and liquid odor
emission sources. Floats were attached to the sides of the hood for

sampling of liquid odorous sources. Moreover, the hood consists of
two radial fans with a constant volumetric flow that homogenize
the smell inside the hood. The inlet fan sucks in outside air via an
exchangeable orifice and transports the air from the top into a
corner of the hood through an active carbon filter. The sampling

hood is made of stainless steel by a structure of 1 m [2] of covered
surface area. A standard sampling device (model CSD30) is connected to the ventilated sampling hood from the suction nozzles.
CSD30 consists of a vacuum container built of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and stainless steel, which evacuates air by a vacuum pump with a default odor sampling duration of 30 min. The
odor samples were stored in bags of odor-neutral material of 10-L
widely known as Nalophan [®] bags. Subsequently, the odor samples were analyzed by dynamic olfactometry. A TO8 olfactometer
developed also by Olfasense GmbH based on the ‘Yes/No’ method
was used to determine the odor concentration (OC, ou E /m [3] ) in each
sample. A panel of four members, previously calibrated with nbutanol (60 ppm), characterized the gas odor samples. OC was
calculated according to the geometric mean of the odor threshold
values of each panelist, multiplied by a factor that depends on the
olfactometer dilution step factor. The olfactometry analyses were
carried out in the olfactometry laboratory at ambient conditions
(20 [] C and 1 atm). All gaseous samples were collected in duplicate
and were analyzed within 30 h after sampling according to the
European standard (EN-13725). In order to quantify the odorous
impact from each emission source, odor emission rate (OER, ou E /
s$m [2] ) was calculated following equation (1)

OER ðou E =s$m [2] Þ 1⁄4 [OC] [ð][ou] [E]  m 3 Þ $ Q ðm 3  sÞ (1)
S ðm [2] Þ

where OER is the odor emission rate (ou E /s$m [2] ), OC is the odor
concentration (ou E /m [3] ), Q is the airflow rate (m [3] /s) and S is the
sampling surface (m [2] ). It should be noted that the results were
obtained per square meter (m [2] ) according to the covered surface
area of the sampling hood.
Finally, the global odor emission rate (OER G, ou E /s) from the
WMP was obtained as follows (Eq. (2)) considering the joint evaluation of the different emission sources:

6
OER G ðou E =sÞ 1⁄4 X OER i ðou E =s$m [2] Þ$A T ðm [2] Þ (2)

i1⁄41

where OER G is the global odor emission rate (ou E /s), OER i is the odor
emission rate of each emission source (ou E /s$m [2] ) and A T is the total
emission area (m [2] ). It is important to highlight that the height of
the composting piles (1 m for C-SL and 3 m for C-OFMSW) was
considered to quantify the total emission area.

### 2.5. Statistical analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the data set

obtained from the physico-chemical, respirometric and olfactometric variables to jointly evaluate the sources of odor emission.
The main goal of this statistical method is to transform the set of
variables, which are called originals, into a new set of variables
called principal components (PC), which are linear combinations of
the original data. From a technical point of view, PCA is considered
as a reduction method, which allows reducing the dimension of the
number of original variables that have been considered in the
analysis. Moreover, PCA is a suitable statistical tool to identify
patterns, similarities or differences between different odor emission sources (Toledo et al., 2018b).
Additionally, the need to know and minimize the main causes of
odor emission from a WMP requires the application of new techniques to allow finding the relationship between odor emission and
physico-chemical and respirometric variables. Specifically, Multivariate regression was performed to estimate the odor emission as
a function of p-independent predictor variables (physico-chemical
and respirometric variables). To do so, OER was predicted following
equation (3):

14
OER ðpÞ 1⁄4 X a i $x i (3)

i1⁄41

where OER(p) is the estimated odor emission rate, a i is the influence
coefficient of each independent variable and x i is the independent
variable.
Moreover, the coefficients of the prediction equation (a i ) obtained were normalized to determine the most influential independent variables for predicting the odor emissions. The
percentage of influence of each independent variable was evaluated according to equation (4):

% influence 1⁄4 ~~n~~ a i $x i $100 (4)
~~P~~ i1⁄41 [a] i [$][x] i

where % influence is the percentage of influence, n is the number of
independent predictor variables, a i is the influence coefficient of
each predictor variable and x i is the predictor variable.
STATISTICA version 10 software was used to perform the PCA
and multivariate regression.

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Physico-chemical assessment of the different emission sources

The management of different raw materials in a WMP generates nuisance odors derived from several factors (Giungato et al.,
2016). These factors could be related to the physico-chemical
characteristics of the raw materials being managed, so that they
should be evaluated to find the most influential ones on odor
emission.

#### 3.1.1. pH and conductivity

Among the monitoring variables, pH value is important to
evaluate the status of different odor emission sources or substrates.

pH conditions are markedly related to the generation of odors and
microbiological activity (Sundberg et al., 2013). Changes in pH
conditions could directly influence in the formation of specific
odorants (Wadud et al., 2012).

Fig. 1A shows the pH values of the substrates managed in each
emission source of the WMP evaluated. The areas with fresh

organic waste such as OFMSW, SL and IW, which might be the most
relevant emission sources in the generation of unpleasant odors,
reached acidic pH values. OFMSW and SL are stored during a short

period time before being subjected to the composting process. The
storage of organic waste releases high amount of organic acids,
including butyric acid and valeric acid, responsible in a small part
for the total odor potential (Qamaruz-Zaman and Milke, 2012). The
large amount of fresh material and the fermentation taking place
during the storage time acidify the pH. In both cases, the low pH
values indicate the immature state of stabilization of OFMSW and

SL. Furthermore, IW is subjected to organic contamination as
demonstrated by the acidic pH in the aqueous extract carried out.
Thus, the organic matter adhered to IW showed the same behavior
as OFMSW. Regarding waste with high pH values, LIX and C
e
OFMSW reached an alkaline pH value within the range of 7.8 8.2,
followed by C-SL with neutral pH. The suitable course of composting is characterized by reaching alkaline pH values due to the
mineralization of organic matter with the loss of organic acids and
generation of CO 2 (Onwosi et al., 2017). As for LIX, the accumulation
of salts from the different stages of composting, flushing water,
vehicle washing and landfill leaching significantly increases
salinity. Moreover, the dissolved organic matter in LIX is slowly
eliminated and there is even formation of algae by the eutrophication due to the presence of inorganic carbon, nitrogen and
phosphorus.
On the other hand, Fig. 1B shows the conductivity of the
different substrates evaluated. As can be observed, IW reached
the highest conductivity values due to the aqueous extract contains metal ions from the containers and cans that might be
found in this type of waste. In this sense, Rosal et al. (2012)
described that the contact of organic matter with metals leads
to their extraction and transfer to the waste. The conductivity in
LIX might be also high due to the large amount of dissolved salts.
According to Huang et al. (2004), during the composting process
the conductivity of the solid substrate could decrease due to the
loss of mineral salts by leaching. This fact explains the high
concentration of salts collected in the leachate lagoons. In the
case of fresh organic materials, OFMSW showed higher conductivity than SL due to the heterogeneity and metal content that
characterizes such a fraction of municipal waste. Finally, the
conductivity of both composted substrates (C-OFMSW and C-SL)
is determined by the nature and composition of the starting
material and mainly by their concentration of salts and ammonium or nitrate ions formed during the process (Sanchez- []
Monedero et al., 2001).

#### 3.1.2. Relationship between total organic carbon (C TOC ) and volatile

solids (VS)
The soluble and total organic matter are interesting from the
point of view of their fermentative degradation and the possibility
of leading to the emission of nuisance odors. The fermentative stage
of organic matter not only emits CO 2 and aqueous vapor, but also
## trace amounts of other gases, being NH 3, VSCs and VOCs the main

responsible for distasteful odors. Previous studies reported that the
major odor emission occur when the raw materials are transported,
delivered, preprocessed, or during their biological treatment,
especially while turning or starting the hydrolytic stage (DelgadoRodríguez et al., 2012; Schlegelmilch et al., 2005).

Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the different emission sources
according to the joint evaluation of C TOC and VS. Although the
correlation coefficient is relatively low (r [2] 1⁄4 0.5924), all points
evaluated show a linear trend, which indicates that there is a logical
relationship between dissolved organic matter and total organic
matter. Four different groups can be observed, with OFMSW and SL

e
showing high concentration of VS (around 60 70%) and 6% of
soluble organic matter as no intensive oxidative treatment process
has taken place. C-OFMSW and C-SL were also grouped considering
their lower content of VS and C TOC due to the bioconversion of

organic matter. These substrates are probably the emission sources
with the smallest odorous impact. In this sense, the maturity process of composting produces a large decrease in VS, which increases
the stability of the composted material and reduces the odorous
impact significantly. The waste with the lowest concentration of
total and soluble organic matter is IW, due to the low percentage of
organic fraction adhered to its surface, which was quantified from
the aqueous extraction. Finally, LIX contains a high percentage of VS
because the results are expressed in dry matter, thus allowing their
comparison with solid raw materials. The high concentration of
soluble organic matter is characteristic of this type of waste with
marked potential to produce odors also due to the release of
gaseous nitrogenous compounds in the form of ammonia (Eghball
et al., 1997).

#### 3.1.3. Relationship between ammoniacal and total nitrogen

Among the main odorous compounds emitted in a WMP,
#### nitrogenous compounds such as ammonia (NH 3 ) are the most

influential smelly gases derived from the decomposition of nitrogen (Eitzer, 1995). Nitrogen contained in organic waste is linked to
the organic fraction as a part of the structure of proteins and peptides, so that its bioavailability is generally low (Amlinger et al.,
2003). Moreover, the transformations of nitrogen derived from
the degradation of organic matter such as ammonification, nitrification and denitrification depend fundamentally on the nature of
the organic material and its biodegradation rate (S [] anchezMonedero et al., 2001). In a WMP, the mineralization of nitrogen
in the form of ammonia (ammonification) mainly occurs in the
reception of fresh organic materials or during the treatment of
organic waste by composting, but it could be dissolved as ammoniacal nitrogen (NH 4 [þ] ). In this sense, pH plays an important role as
ammoniacal nitrogen may volatilize at high pH values and consequently generate unpleasant odors. Wu et al. (2017) highlighted
nitrogenous compounds as potential odorants, being the most
prominent species in air sample.
In light of the previous information, Fig. 3 shows the relationship between total nitrogen (TKN) and ammoniacal nitrogen (NNH 4 [þ] ). As can be observed, all emission sources evaluated show a
linear trend with high correlation coefficient (r [2] 1⁄4 0.9098), which
indicates that there is a relationship between mineralized nitrogen
in the form of N-NH 4 [þ] and TKN. The percentage of ammoniacal nitrogen might probably cause nuisance odors. A slope of the linear
trend as high as 0.2182 was obtained, which indicates that 21% of
the total nitrogen is in ammoniacal form (with the exception of
LIX). In the case of LIX, a marked deviation is observed due to nitrogen is highly solubilized and dissolved as N-NH 4 [þ] . According to
Fig. 1A, neutral or acidic pH values were obtained for all points
evaluated, except LIX that reached alkaline pH and favored the
volatilization of ammonia. Moreover, the presence of N-NH 4 [þ] could
be influenced by other components such as heavy metals and high
concentration of salts, which is widely known as chelation (Hughes
et al., 2018).
These results reveal that the composition, the physico-chemical
characteristics and nature of organic materials to be composted
provide information about the potential odors generated during

M. Toledo et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 210 (2019) 1098e1108 1103

biodegradable.
On the other hand, the biodegradability of the substrates being
managed in each emission source and its odor concentration were
correlated as shown in Fig. 4B. In this case, the relationship between both variables fits adequately to a linear trend with high
correlation coefficient (r [2] 1⁄4 0.8784). Depending on the substrate
composition, the degree of biodegradation of the organic matter of
each substrate is directly influential on odor emissions during its
management. Once again, SL was found to have the highest concentration of organic matter to be degraded, followed by OFMSW,
which led to the emission of odorous gaseous compounds
(Gutierrez et al., 2015 [] ). Biodegradability and odor concentration of
C-SL and C-OFMSW was relatively low due to their marked degree
of stability (Barrena et al., 2014). For IW, odor concentration
generated was comparable to the values obtained for OFMSW as
the organic fraction adhered released high amount of odorous
compounds. Finally, the biodegradability of LIX reached similar
values to OFMSW due to their characteristic high organic load (da
Fig. 3. Relationship between total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and ammoniacal nitrogen Costa et al., 2018). It is worth noting that the OD 20 value of LIX

waste management. The evaluation of odor emission sources according to these variables or even additional ones such as respirometric and olfactometric variables could help develop an odor
map from which the most critical points of a WMP, in terms of
odorous impact, might be identified.

### 3.2. Odorous impact and respirometric variables

As mentioned above, the relationship between the different
operational variables and odor emission might provide useful information about the main causes in the emission of odorous com
pounds and allows acting on the management processes for their
minimization. Microbiological activity is directly related to the
respiration index and this, in turn, to the mineralization of organic
matter carried out by microorganisms. Previous studies demonstrated the validity to monitor odor emissions through respirometric variables during composting since high correlations
between both variables were observed (Gutierrez et al., 2015 [] ).

Fig. 4A shows the relationship between the SOUR and the odor
emission rate considering all emission sources in the WMP under
study. Although the correlation coefficient is not markedly high
(r [2] 1⁄4 0.3507), a linear trend was observed even though the selected
samples were diverse and heterogeneous. According to Sidełko
et al. (2017), the respiration index determines the level of biological stability which is highly related to the organic matter content in
organic materials. In this sense, fresh substrates such as SL and
OFMSW led to higher oxygen consumption than the values
observed for the other samples and were found to be the substrates
with the highest microbiological activity and odorous impact. In
contrast, C-SL and C-OFMSW reached the lowest microbial activity
due to their maturity state and its direct effect on the low odor
emission. In the case of IW, the organic matter adhered to this
material had not yet undergone a hydrolysis process to fragment
the organic fraction into other more biodegradable substrates. Such
type of organic fraction was solubilized due to the aqueous extract
carried out and was degraded by microorganisms, with the
consequent increase of the respiration index. Moreover, the presence of chelated metals with organic matter might inhibit the
respiratory capacity of the substrate and therefore reduce the SOUR
value. This fact was also observed for LIX, as this substrate contains
a high-mineralized organic load. The presence of biodegradable
dissolved organic matter is a consequence of the accumulation of
C TOC from different parts of the WMP, which is dissolved and easily

1104 M. Toledo et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 210 (2019) 1098e1108

was a clear example of the accumulation of organic matter derived
from the different parts of the plant.

### 3.3. Odor map of the WMP

The relationships found between the different physicochemical, respirometric and olfactometric variables monitored in
each emission source and their influence on the generation of
odorous compounds allow developing an odor map. An odor map
summarizes and allows detecting visually the most critical points of
a waste management plant in terms of odoriferous impact. In this
sense, Licen et al. (2018) built an odor control map by using the
electronic nose with a chemometric approach at a residential site.
The odor map was reported to be a suitable tool to identify malodor

sources.

Being dynamic olfactometry the European accepted method to
measure odor concentration (OC) and with the intention to classify
the emission sources according to their odor impact, Fig. 5 illustrates a new approach by means of the odor mapping. The most
informative physico-chemical, respirometric and olfactometric
variables (VS, OD 20, OC and OER) were selected and distributed on
the physical map of the WMP. As can be observed, the highest
critical areas where those were SL, OFMSW and IW are managed.
The specific values of OC were found to be 7138,1700 and 1326 ou E /
m [3], respectively. The concentration of VS and OD 20 in the area
devoted to managing SL and OFMSW was also high in comparison
with the other emission sources. However, IW showed a high odor
potential with low VS and OD 20 values, reaching similar levels to
those obtained for OFMSW. This fact reveals the influence of the
organic fraction adhered onto the surface of IW on its odorous
potential, which could be minimized with a correct segregation of

materials in origin. As a middle critical point in terms of odorous
impact, the odor concentration for LIX was found to be 337 ou E /m [3],
while a significant content of biodegradable dissolved organic
matter was evidenced by the OD 20 (142 mgO 2 /gVS). In this context,
da Costa et al. (2018) reported the high concentration of recalcitrant
organic matter of that substrate. Finally, the area for C-SL and COFMSW were found to be the least critical points in the WMP. In
fact, the OC values obtained in both areas were below the detection
limit of the olfactometer (  30 ou E /m [3] ). In addition, VS concentration and biodegradation degree were significantly reduced, which
indicates the proper stability of the composted material. Similar
results were reported by He et al. (2018), who evaluated the odor
emission from sludge composting and they reported that the stability of the final compost reduces significantly gaseous emissions.
Additionally, the global odor emission rate was evaluated
considering the partial odor emission rate of each odorous source
and the total emission area (Table 2). Globally, the WMP under
study generates 4847 ou E /s. Furthermore, the results indicate that
the partial impact of the different emission sources with respect to
the global emission was 60% for SL, 15% for OFMSW, 13% for IW, 11%
for LIX, 0.88% for C-OFMSW and 0.26% for C-SL.
Considering the different influential factors on the generation of
unpleasant odor, the odor mapping aims to evaluate the potential
impact generated in each specific area of a WMP. This useful tool
allows new management methods to be proposed in order to
minimize the global odor emission, with the consequent social,
economic and environmental benefits. On the one hand, the
implementation of a semipermeable cover could be a reasonable
solution to mitigate the unpleasant odor peaks during the first
stage of the composting process (Gonzalez et al., 2016 [] ). On the
other hand, the use of physical, chemical and biological methods

have also been developed to decompose odorants in lagoons
(Zhang et al., 2013). Finally, vegetation systems or shelterbelts
introduced near the odor source have been successfully proven to
redirect wind and/or reduce its speed leading to the minimization
of the odorous impact (Tyndall and Colletti, 2006).

### 3.4. Statistical analysis

#### 3.4.1. PCA: patterns and differences among sampling points

The need to explain the main characteristics of the different
sampling points and the influence of the physico-chemical, respirometric and olfactometric variables on the generation of odor
emission implies the application of a chemometric approach to
correlate the data matrix. Thus, PCA was performed in order to find
similarities or differences among the different sampling points in
the WMP under study. Previous studies applied successfully PCA to
detect similarities and differences between residual substrates

from diverse origin (Gil et al., 2018), or even to find relationships
between operational, physico-chemical and olfactometric variables
during the composting process of different agroindustrial waste
(Toledo et al., 2018b).
The loadings and scores plots obtained from the selected variables of the six critical sampling points are shown in Fig. 6A and B.
As can be seen, both principal components (PC1 and PC2) explain
67.3% of the total variance. Individually, four significantly different
groups were created in the scores plot (Fig. 6A). As expected, C-SL
and C-OFMSW are markedly related and included in the same
group, followed by IW and LIX which showed similar characteristics. Finally, SL and OFMSW were found to be significantly different
between them and with respect to the other points. The joint
evaluation of both plots (Fig. 6A and B) provides relevant information related to the relationship between the physico-chemical
variables and the sampling points. As can be seen, SL presents a
marked predominance in odor, SOUR and OD 20, while OFMSW is

## more influenced by N-NH 4 [þ], SOUR and VS. Conversely, C-SL and C
OFMSW are strongly linked to pH, residence time (t) and also P 2 O 5,
which is typically related to the maturity stage at the end of the
composting process (Toledo et al., 2018b). In the case of IW and LIX,
M and Cond were the most predominant variables due to the high
water content in the substrates and mineralization of organic
matter. Specifically, the direct contact of organic matter with metals
in IW drags part of them to the aqueous extract and therefore, the
conductivity is more significant with respect to other variables of
the set of samples.

#### 3.4.2. Multivariate regression: influence of the physico-chemical

and respirometric variables on the odorous impact
OER was predicted by means of a multivariate regression model
(equation (3)) from the physico-chemical and respirometric variables previously evaluated. As shown in Fig. 7A, all points (corresponding to the emission sources) are within a prediction interval
of 95% and the correlation fits adequately to a linear trend with a
regression coefficient (r) of 0.9768. These results might suggest the
suitability of the model and demonstrate that the adequate monitoring of the physico-chemical and respirometric variables would
allow reliable prediction of the odorous impact derived from the
different activities carried out in the WMP.
On the other hand, the most influential variables on the odorous
impact were also evaluated following equation (4). In this respect,
the percentage of influence of each physico-chemical and respirometric variable on the prediction correlation of OER is shown in
Fig. 7B. The synergistic and antagonistic effects were taken into
account since both the positive and negative coefficients are
influential in absolute value. As can be observed, the odor generation is mainly influenced by the respirometric variables (SOUR and
OD 20 ) and the nitrogen concentration in different forms (TKN and
## N-NH 4 [þ] ). Moreover, the residence time in the plant (t) was also

found to be an important variable in odor emission due to the
different maturity stage of the organic materials to be managed.
Finally, it is worth noting that samples with different moisture
contents are compared. Moisture is one of the most influential
variables due to its relationship with the microbiological activity to
degrade the organic matter, leading to the generation of odorous
compounds (Liang et al., 2003).
This type of studies allows the improvement of large-scale waste
management plants and the reduction of the environmental impact
in today's society, with important economic and environmental
consequences at both local and global scales.

## 4. Conclusions

Bearing in mind the results obtained, the following conclusions
can be drawn:

 - Odor mapping through different monitoring variables helped
identifying the critical odor emission points in a WMP. The most
critical emission source was found to be fresh SL followed by
OFMSW, due to their high content in nitrogenous compounds,
biodegradable organic matter, moisture and marked microbiological activity.

 - The inorganic fraction of municipal solid waste showed high
odorous potential derived from the small fraction of organic
matter stuck on its surface, which came from non-selective
separation in origin.

 - The correlation of the data set from the different emission

sources allowed their grouping as a function of the physicochemical, respirometric and olfactometric characteristics by
PCA. Such an analysis reproduces 67.3% of the total variance of
the samples evaluated.

 - The odor emission rate was predicted for all the studied fractions as a function of its physico-chemical and respirometric
variables through multivariable analysis. The most influential
variables on odor generation were found to be SOUR and OD 20,
## followed by TKN, N-NH 4 [þ] and residence time in the WMP.

 - Finally, the global odor emission derived from the waste treatment plant was found to be 4847 ou E /s, being the partial contributions of 60% for SL, 15% for OFMSW, 13% for IW, 11% for LIX,
0.87% for C-OFMSW and 0.25% for C-SL. This work has shown the

suitability of evaluating the critical points in terms of odor
emission to improve waste management in urban WMPs.
