**Material Safety Data Sheet**

**Iron Ore Pellets** **September 2016**

**SECTION 1. PRODUCT AND COMPANY IDENTIFICATION**

Product name: Iron Ore Pellets
Chemical name: Iron ore concentrate agglomerated
Chemical family: Iron ore
Formula: Iron ore concentrate, the main component is Fe 2 O 3
Use: This product is used as feedstock of iron in blast furnace for steel production.

Manufacturer: Compañía Minera del Pacífico S.A.
Address: Brasil Street, 1050 Vallenar
Región de Atacama 1611167
Chile
Emergency phone number: +56 51 266 5870
E-mail: mlisboa@cmp.cl

**SECTION 2. HAZARDOUS IDENTIFICATION**

This product is not a hazardous material with the HPR classification criteria.
Iron Ore Pellets are inert solid and do not meet the requirements for classification as dangerous under
both Dangerous Substances Directive EU (67/548 / EEC) and the directive based on the Classification,
Labeling and Packaging of substances and mixtures (CLP) Regulations (EC 1272/2008).

None of the chemicals in this product are considered highly hazardous by OSHA.

Skin contact: No adverse effects expected.

Ingestion: Extremely large oral dosages may produce gastrointestinal disturbances.

Chronic exposure: Long-term inhalation exposure to iron has resulted in mottling of the lungs, a condition
referred to as siderosis. This is considered a benign pneumoconiosis and does not ordinarily cause significant physiological impairment.

Not classifiable as a human carcinogen.
