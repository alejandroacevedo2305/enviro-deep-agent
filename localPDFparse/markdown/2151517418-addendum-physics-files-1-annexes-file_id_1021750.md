#### 950L Bucket Fill Factors and Selection Chart

The bucket size must be chosen based on the density of the material and on the expected fill factor. The new Cat Performance Series Buckets with longer
floor, larger bucket opening, increased repository angle, rounded side boards and integrated spill guard, demonstrate fill factors significantly higher than
previous generation or non Cat buckets. The actual volume handled by the machine is thus often larger than the rated capacity.

**Loose Material** **Material Density** **Fill Factor (%)***

Earth/Clay 1500-1700 kg/m [3 ] 115

Sand and Gravel 1500-1700 kg/m [3 ] 115

Aggregate: 25-76 mm 1600-1700 kg/m [3 ] 110

19 mm and smaller 1800 kg/m [3 ] 105
Rock: 76 mm and larger 1600 kg/m [3 ] 100

*As a % of ISO rated capacity.
**Note:** Fill Factors achieved will also depend on whether the product is washed or not washed.
