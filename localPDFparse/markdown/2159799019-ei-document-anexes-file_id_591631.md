# AMC EZEE PAC LTM

FLUID LOSS CONTROL AGENTS

Description

AMC EZEE PAC LTM is a new generation, highly dispersive low viscosity

polyanionic cellulose polymer used for improving filtration control in

most water based drilling fluid systems without appreciably increasing

viscosity. AMC EZEE PAC LTM will not fisheye and has been designed

to disperse rapidly into any make-up water even under the poorest

conditions. The mixing efficiencies of AMC EZEE PAC LTM reduces

wastage and promotes lower mud costs and total hole costs.

Application

AMC EZEE PAC LTM has applications in most drilling mediums and has

the ability to improve core recovery in diamond drilling, can be added

to enhance a bentonite base system and is compatible with most

polymers and lubricants. Addition rates can be adjusted to suit specific

applications, hardness must not exceed 400mg / L of calcium.

Typical Physical Properties

Appearance: White, free flowing powder

pH (0.2 % solution): 8.5 - 9.5

Recommended Treatment

AMC EZEE PAC LTM is used from 1 - 6 kg / m [3] (0.35 - 2.1 lb / bbl)

depending on the nature of the mud system and salt concentration.

AMC EZEE PAC LTM can be slowly introduced into mechanical agitation,

through water discharge or through a mud hopper.

_Please Note: Several factors will dictate the most appropriate concentration_

_rate. Please contact your nearest AMC representative for optimum results._
