# Sandvik DE130 Diamond core drill

**Technical specification**
DE130 is a new version of the DE model that was originally

designed in 1983. Over the years a number of re-designs,
modifications, improvements and adaptations to various

applications have taken place. This process goes on continu
ously in co-operation between Manufacturer and User.

A large number of options are available to match the most

varied drilling conditions. The DE130 has proven itself in
a number of field applications to be the most reliable and

economic drill for the general drilling contractor or mine, in

both surface and underground applications.

Sandvik Mining and Construction has a world wide net of

Distributors, Service and Spare Part Stocking available to

DE users.

Some applications where DE130 has proven its value:

- Horizontal de-watering drilling H size to 330 m in a

mine de-watering project

- Wireline coring 56 mm to over 1200 m

- High accuracy coring ø 222 mm in vertical pillars in a

construction project

- Coring ø 131 mm and DTH drilling ø 127 mm in har

bour quay reinforcement project

- N and B size coring at altitudes over 5500 metres in the

Andean Cordillera

**Basic drill**

**DRILL UNIT**

Feed Boom

Standard version is made of very stiff and torsion resistant
aluminium profile. The feed boom is mounted on a frame

with hydraulic tilt cylinder and mechanical supports.

The mounting frame for the underground version is spe
cially designed for easy setting-up when fan drilling and has

a full range adjustment from vertical down to vertical up.
Positioning is simplified by a mechanical feed boom posi
tioner allowing a telescoping of 1 - 2 m (3 - 6’) depending

on feed boom length.

Feed length (underground) 1700 mm (5’7”)

Total length (underground) 3065 mm (10’)

Feeding force 46.1 kN (10350 lbs)

Pulling force 61.5 kN (13820 lbs)

Feed rate, drilling max 0.04 m/s (1.5”/s)

Feed rate, rod running, max 1.1 m/s (43”/s)

Practical rod running speed 20 m/min (60’/min)

Speed, infinitely variable 0-2000 rpm. Clamping by spring

action, opened hydraulically.

Exchangeable rod guide and jaws for standard drill rods

and casings.

Number of jaws 8

Gripping range 30-76 mm (13/16”-3”)

Gripping range, set of jaws 10 mm (3/8”)

Rodholder

Clamping by accumulator action, opened hydrauli-cally.

Exchangeable rod guide and jaws for standard drill rods,

casings and core barrels.

Number of jaws 2

Gripping range 30-106 mm (13/16”-41/8”)

Gripping range, set of jaws 20 mm (3/4”)

Max opening, without jaws 136 mm (55/16”)

All capacity indications are given without any guaranty but

could be expected in “normal” ground conditions by a

well-trained drilling crew using high quality drilling tools.

Practical up-drilling capacity is about 50% of capacity in

holes vertical down.
