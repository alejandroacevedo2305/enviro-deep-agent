**Dear Distinguished Stakeholders,**

In the context of the US’s Section 201 investigation, India’s
trade protection and ‘531’ photovoltaic new policy in China etc.,
the PV industry experienced dramatic volatility in 2018. Trina
Solar has been striving to facilitate the stable development and
transformation of our company.

Governance & Development: In 2018, Trina Solar continued to forge
ahead. We established our own State Innovation Platform, aiming
to cultivate and retain internal innovation sources for promotion of
our business development. Trina Solar actively promoted intelligent
manufacturing. We made use of IT and big data technology to
improve automation and intelligence for our entire manufacturing
chain. Productivity was enhanced significantly. Trina Solar had
set a new record of 25.04% conversion efficiency for an N-type
mono-crystalline IBC (Interdigitated Back Contact) solar cell. The
IBC solar cell was developed independently by Trina Solar’s State
Key Laboratory (SKL). In 2018, Trina Solar continuously sought
transformation and took our courage to innovate. We launched
our third generation of new residential PV products - SuperiorCore S, Smart PV Solution - TrinaPro, Trina Energy IoT (Internet of
Things) and other innovative products and businesses. We were
dedicated to providing our customer with superior products and
services. With our perseverance and hard-working spirit, we had
participated in and completed the construction of many PV plants
and projects around the world, including grid-connection of 14 MW
DC utility-scale project in Miyagi Prefecture in Japan; wining the bid
for two ‘Top Runner’ projects - 250 MW project in Changzhi, Shanxi
Province and another 250MW in Tongchuan, Shaanxi Province;
launching of our first PV residential kit - Trinahome project in
India; providing 167 MW PV modules for a farm in Murcia province
in Spain; delivering a micro-grid project for 14 islands in Maldives
etc. With the achievements in the areas of innovation, intelligent
manufacturing and Energy IoT, etc., Trina Solar won the “China
Industrial Awards - Enterprise Category” in the 5 th China Industrial
Awards, being the first PV company receiving the honour in China.

Environmental Protection and Green Development: Trina Solar
always pays attention to green development. As of the end of
2018, the cumulative grid-connected capacity of Trina Solar's solar
power plants in China exceeded 1.6 GW. In 2018, after the sales of
solar plants, the solar plants owned by Trina Solar generated 775
million kWh of clean solar power, which exceeded the total power
consumptions (722 million kWh) for Trina Solar’s manufacturing
operations and R&D activities in China. This means that Trina Solar
has once again achieved “zero” carbon emissions, enabling the goal
of producing our clean energy products with clean energy.

Trina Solar strived to continuously improve energy efficiency,
reduce emissions and conserve resources throughout our
operations. Establishment of Energy Management SystemISO50001 at our manufacturing sites demonstrates our energyefficiency improvements and commitments. Trina Solar established
and implemented an internal carbon-trading system. We set up an
integrated energy consumption target for each department and
assessed its performance monthly to encourage energy-saving
initiative. In 2018, Trina Solar’s electricity and water consumption per
MW module production were 133.6 MWH/MW and 1360.1 m3/MW
respectively, representing 38.8% and 31.6% of reduction compared
to that of 2014. We disclosed greenhouse gas emission annually
based on the international standard - ISO14064 requirements. The
greenhouse gas emission per MW module production in 2018 is
119 tone/MW, being 34.9% reduction compared to that in 2014.

**Dealing with Climate Change** **Reduction of GHG Emission**

Trina Solar has been paying attention to
sustainable development. We conduct ISO14064

GHG emission verification and disclose our

carbon emission annually. We always look
for opportunities to reduce GHG emission in
product design, production, and packaging
processes. We continuously identify potential
energy-saving projects, aiming for fulfilment of
our commitment to sustainable development.

Trina Solar conducts GHG verification annually in accordance

We profoundly realized that climate change has posed
serious challenges to the environment, economy and
society. The development of world economy is powered
by energy. Fossil fuels are the major energy source that
is being used in the world today. However, consumption
of fossil fuels release greenhouse gases (GHGs), such
as carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide,

carbon monoxide etc. The emission of GHGs can lead

to serious environmental issues such as air pollution
and global warming. Besides, fossil fuels are not
renewable. Therefore, it is irreversible that the renewable

energy, such as solar energy, will take the place of the
conventional energy. The renewable energy is playing
an increasingly important role and becoming one of the
mainstream sources of energy around the world.

Global climate change is a serious environmental, economic and

social challenge that warrants an equally serious response by

governments and the private sectors. Governments and the private

sectors need to actively adopt energy saving measures to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions and effectively support the realization of

the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. As a global leader in

energy IoT, Trina Solar is committed to providing clean solar energy

for the world. We promise to promote sustainable manufacturing

and build an environmentally-secure planet by using energy

and natural resources efficiently. We consistently reduce energy

consumption and carbon emission from production and commercial

operations by enhancing energy efficiency, and work tirelessly to

promote green development and build an ecological civilization.

with international standard ISO14064 requirements. The scope of

verification includes scope 1- direct GHG emission and scope 2

indirect GHG emission. We continuously monitor and improve our

GHG management performance. Total greenhouse gas emissions

for Trina Solar’s China operations in 2018 were 609.5 thousand

tons of CO 2 e, which was approximately 13.7% lower than that of

2017.

Based on the requirements of ‘The Vienna Convention for the

Protection of the Ozone Layer’ and ‘The Montreal Protocol on

Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer’, all the refrigerants and

**Enhancement of Energy Efficiency**

Focus on Supply Chain Care for Employees Contribution to Society Appendix

Sustainable development requires not only clean energy,
but also higher energy efficiency. Trina Solar focuses
on reducing environmental impact from its operations.
We strive to enhance our energy use efficiency while
using our energy in a responsible manner. Trina Solar
continuously reduces CO 2 emission and makes our best
efforts to produce more cost-competitive products and

contribute to climate change mitigation.

Trina Solar headquarters’ plants in Changzhou took an lead
to establish Energy Management System ISO50001 in the
photovoltaic industry in accordance with international standard.
We continuously reduce energy consumption and improve our
energy use efficiency by establishing energy targets, defining
and refining energy conservation responsibilities, as well as
implementing energy conservation projects. We systematically
applied energy conservation measures and energy saving
technologies to real practice.

Internal Carbon Trade Scheme

The primary energy mainly used in our company is natural gas. The secondary
energy includes electricity and diesel. The energy-consumed media include water,
nitrogen, oxygen and argon. We record and analyze the consumption of primary
and secondary energy. Meanwhile we calculate the consumption of indirect energyconsumed media. We report them in the form of standard coal-equivalent (SCE)
consumption per MW module production on a monthly basis, i. e., integrated energy
consumption (Ton SCE/MW). We implemented an internal carbon trade scheme for
all domestic and overseas plants. We setup an annual integrated energy consumption
target for each department and then performed monthly assessments. Based on
the average carbon price in the domestic carbon trade market, we awarded carbon
emission bonuses for those departments who have achieved their targets, and
imposed carbon emission penalties for those who have not fulfilled their carbon
emission targets. We sent a monthly message to department managers, reminding
them to be aware of the impact of their operating activities on the environment.
We encouraged them to develop technologies and carried out energy conservation
project, so as to continuously reduced energy consumption and greenhouse gas
emissions from operations. In 2018, the consolidated energy consumption per MW
module decreased by 12% compared to that of 2017.

Renovation Project for 35 KV Electrical Substation

The 35KV substation, located in southwestern campus in Changzhou, was put into
operations in 2005. There were two main transformers, model of S9-5000 and S910000 respectively, in the substation. The transformers were old models with low
energy efficiency and low load ratio. After evaluation, it was decided that the load for
35KV substation could be directly connected to a upstream 110KV substation and the
transformers could be switched off, thus reducing both power consumption and 35KV
variable power. Besides, the safety and reliability of electricity supply were improved. The
renovation project was completed in December 2018. After the renovation, we saved
200,000 kWh/year of electricity consumption, which was equivalent to a reduction of 160
tons/year of carbon emission.

Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE,

2012/19/EU) specifies that manufacturers of electrical and

electronic equipment must guarantee that waste products

created in any EU member states must be recycled and reused,

in order to ensure that electrical and electronic equipment,

including PV modules, is properly managed by means of recycling,

reusing, reclamation and regeneration. In 2012, for the first time,

the Directive took PV modules and equipment into account.

From February 1 st, 2014 onwards, all photovoltaic manufacturers,

distributors and installation contractors in Europe must fully

abide by EU’s rules on waste management, including providing

necessary funds and administration. All PV products must be

labeled with the same “wheelie bin” LOGO designed by WEEE.

`T` rina Solar always focuses on extended producer and has

become a part of the non-profit organization PV CYCLE (European

Photovoltaic Module Take-back and Recycling Organization)

founded in 2007. PV CYCLE is committed to centralizing and

customizing services for the recycling of global waste photovoltaic

products.

- EU member countries: PV CYCLE establishes a network

consisting of hundreds of certified and recycling points,

waste transport firms and dedicated recycling facilities

across the Europe. It provides solutions for sustainable PV

module take-back and recycling, and uses recycled materials

for the making of various new products.

- Other areas: PV CYCLE provides customized services, for

example, whoever needs international parcel service can

inquire on the PV CYCLE's website (www.pvcycle.com) or can

send an email to info@pvcycle.com.

Cooperated with Veolia and French Renewable Energy Union,

PV Cycle built a PV module recycling plant in Roosset, south of

France. The recycling plant was put into operation in 2018. The PV

Recycling Plant uses robots to disassemble and sort PV modules.

95% of the materials can be disassembled, sorted, processed

and recycled. Typical PV modules are made of 65-75% glass, 10

15% aluminum frame, 10% plastic and 3-5% silicon. The sorted

materials are processed, packaged and sent to different industries.

Among them, two-thirds of the glass is processed to become

shattered glass, which is sent to the glass manufacturing industry.

The aluminum frame is sent to the aluminum refinery. The waste

plastic can be used as a fuel in cement plant. The recovered silicon

can be used in the precious metal industry. Finally, the remaining

cables and connectors are crushed and sold as copper beads.

Trina Solar (Japan) Limited joined in the Glass Recycling

Committee of Japan (GRCJ). The core members of GRCJ consist

of associations and companies who promote the reuse of waste

glass. The GRCJ was established for the promotion of recycling

PV modules, especially the recycling of waste glass. The recycling

process includes collection, transportation, disassembly, sorting,

separation and glass production of waste modules. Glass and

cell scraps are mainly separated and collected by smashing and

gravity separation. Glass scraps can be used as raw materials for

building materials and ceramics industry. The metal component

of cell scraps will be recycled and reused by specialized metal

recycling companies.

**Sustainable Use of Water Resource**

Trina Solar regards protecting water resource as one of its

important tasks, and strives to reduce the consumption of water

resource per MW module production through sustainable use

of water resource. Solar module production consumes a lot of

water. To carry out water conservation management, we setup

water saving goals for each workshops and implemented various

of water saving projects, such as reuse of RO (Reverse Osmosis)

rejected water, treat and reuse of wastewater, collection of

condensated water from air conditioning system etc. We setup a

strict maintenance scheme to clean RO membrane to increase DI

(De-ionized) water yield. With business expanding, total amount

of water consumption is in increasing trend. But as we continue

to develop and implement water conservation projects, our water

use efficiency continues to increase.

As an advocate and practitioner of environmental
protection, Trina Solar has always been committed
to sustainable development throughout the whole
product life cycle, from product development,
raw material procurement and manufacturing,
to resource & energy utilization and waste

management.

We believe that the most precious resource is the natural

environment on which human beings depend. Trina Solar will

spare no efforts to fulfill our commitment to all stakeholders,

and will always concern for human beings and the sustainable

development of the earth. Green manufacturing and

environmental protection has always been the lifeline of our

**Wastewater Discharge**

Focus on Supply Chain Care for Employees Contribution to Society Appendix

**Waste Management**

Inadequate waste management may not only cause soil
pollution and damage eco-balance, but also lead to water

pollution and air pollution. Trina Solar treats wastes as resources.
We segregate different wastes, and manage them based on

the principle of "3Rs" - Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. We adopt
the following measures to reduce the amount of waste from
manufacturing processes.

The wastewater from the manufacturing process which can't
be reused or recycled will be adequately treated by our internal
wastewater treatment plants prior to being discharged into the
municipal sewer for further treatment. There was no occurrence
of chemical leakage or wastewater limit-exceeding event since
our operations started.

As a company with a strong orientation towards social
responsibility, Trina Solar has been striving to lead the solar
energy sector in proactively discovering wastewater denitrification and de-phosphorization technologies. After a
few years of experimental exploration, Trina Solar has finally
decided upon using the conventional technique-biochemical
nitration and de-nitrification technique to remove nitrogen and

phosphorus from wastewater. The manufacturing base of Trina
Solar is located in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, belonging to
the Lake Tai basin - one of the most developed areas in China.
To meet the stringent requirement of “zero” emission of nitrogen
and phosphorus for projects within Taihu reserve regulated
in Jiangsu Provincial Ordinance of Lake Taihu Water Pollution
Prevention and Treatment, we have completed the wastewater
de-nitrification update project in West Campus, East Campus and
Northeast Campus. We successfully used the organic matter from
wastewater generated in the wafer workshop as the necessary
carbon source. We also used the small amount of phosphoric acid
generated in the diffusion process as the phosphate source for
biochemical nitration. Thereby, we achieved the goal of "treating
waste with waste", and lower down the environment impact.

**Green Office**

A quarter of our time each week is spent in the office. We
believe that green office not only means minimizing the
environmental impact of office activities, but also means
creating an environment beneficial to the physical and mental
health of employees so that they feel physically comfortable and
are spiritually uplifted.

We work to gradually incorporate the “green office” theme

development and ecological protection has been

one of key issues many enterprises face. Trina

Solar always conducts environmental impact

assessment (EIA) according to local requirements.

EIA is to evaluate the positive and negative

environmental impact when developing a new

project or constructing a new solar power plant.

We are committed to protecting the ecological

environment and biodiversity of local communities.

To protect ecological environment, we build PV projects without

changing the original use of the land, such as PV plus agriculture, PV
plus fishery etc. while providing clean energy to local communities:

 - Trina Solar built a solar farm in Dorset, London. We set up

bird houses and bat nests near the farm and planted local

wildflowers while keeping the solar panels high without
affecting the farm's continued grazing.

into fine detail of our work, to greatly reduce the impact of
office activities on the environment. We are gradually reducing
the use of hard copies of documents, and promoting the use
of electronic documents. We established a video conference

system, thus reducing the carbon emission generated during
travels. We install a lamp switch for each cubicle to remind
employees to turn off desk lamp when they leave their cubicle.

**Biological Diversity Management**

 - Trina Solar built a 120MW ‘PV plus fishery’ project in Xiangshui,

Jiangsu Province. The lower layer remains as aquaculture

while the upper layer is PV panels, thus achieving sustainable
economic, ecological and social benefits.

 - Trina Solar successfully built a 5MW ‘PV plus agriculture’

project in Menghe, Changzhou. A shed is constructed for

ecological agriculture, where the roof is made of double-glass

PV modules for clean power generation. The double-glass PV

modules have strong permeability, thus keep the required

illumination for the growth of crops.

 - Trina Solar built a 51MW ‘PV plus agriculture’ project in the

tea garden in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan. The transparent

double-glass PV modules were used above the tea tree for

efficient use of the space. The project generates about 80

million kWh/year clean solar energy, which reduces carbon

emissions by 60,000 tons.

Our plants always keep a section of the land so that it can be a home

for native plants and animals. Moreover, we always try to improve

their living environment, and promote the evolution of biodiversity

at the project location by conducting environmental awareness
raising activities.

**Air Emission**

Trina Solar has built a range of scrubbers, such as acidic/caustic
scrubbers, organic scrubbers etc. to remove pollutants from air
emission according to relevant laws and regulations, to lower
down the concentration of emission and to avoid or lessen the

hazards that arise from air pollution.

In order to meet the on-going stringent emission requirement,

the plants in headquarters, Changzhou invested RMB 7.4 million
to upgrade the acidic scrubbers. Trina Solar engaged accredited
third parties to carry out annual monitoring of air emission from
our exhausts and scrubbers. Results show that air emission from

exhaust and scrubbers are well below the limits of local standard

and solar industrial standard .

The effective supply-chain management can help us reduce risks, improve products quality, achieve
strategic objectives, enhance the overall performance of suppliers, and create commercial values
for ourselves and customers. We constantly focus on our suppliers' performance on corporate social
responsibility, and take it as the base line of choosing suppliers. We drive suppliers for continuous
improvement through supplier assessment, audit and capability-building. We strive to continuously
raise the overall performance of our suppliers and enhance their sustainability, so as to promote the
sustainable development of the entire PV industry chain.

Our supply chain covers more than 80 procurement items, including raw materials, auxiliary materials,
infrastructure, equipment, spare parts, packaging, logistics services, personal protective equipment, office
suppliers, certification services, etc. The purchase team in headquarters in Changzhou is responsible for
purchasing raw materials, auxiliary materials, infrastructure, equipment, installation and logistics services.

Conflict-free Minerals Cooperation for Win-win Situation

**Supplier Development**

Trina Solar focuses on suppliers' sustainable development

c a p a b i l i t i e s. We c o n t i n u o u s l y i m p r o v e t h e o v e r a l l

competitiveness of the supply chain through a comprehensive

supplier review and evaluation process, as well as the full

range of supplier communications and interactions. We focus

on building a sustainable and win-win supply chain system. At

present, the main suppliers are divided into: potential suppliers,

potential qualified suppliers, and qualified suppliers.

Potential Supplier: a supplier who is able to produce or deliver

materials for Trina Solar but temporarily hasn’t obtained Trina

Solar’s recognition for its qualification and ability. The supplier

will be recorded into our potential supplier database. Trina Solar

will choose qualified supplier from that database and assess it

through questionnaire and formal on-site evaluation.

Potentially Qualified Supplier: a supplier who has obtained Trina

Solar’s recognition for its qualification/ability and is added to

Trina Solar’s procurement system.

Qualified Supplier: once a potentially qualified supplier passes

the assessment, it will be upgraded to qualified supplier.

**Supplier Management**

We implement ‘status’ management on suppliers. The status of

suppliers is divided into five states in the procurement system:

approval, R&D, abnormal quality, freezing, and elimination. We

can only issue bulk POs (purchase orders) to the suppliers with

‘approval’ status, and POs in small quantities to the suppliers with

‘R&D’ status. We cannot issue POs to the suppliers with ‘abnormal

quality’, ‘freezing’, and ‘elimination’ status. We developed DQMS

digital quality management system, which helped us manage

all suppliers’ information, status and performance appraisal

effectively. We interacted online with suppliers to promote our

suppliers make continuous improvements.

- Approved Supplier: being approved as a qualified supplier

to place a batch purchasing order.

- Developing Supplier: in the process of development and

only small order for trial.

- Abnormal Supplier: being disqualified more than three

times, the supplier will be classified as 'abnormal'.

- Frozen Supplier: with no deal for one year, the supplier will

be frozen and limited for any new orders.

- Eliminated Supplier: with no deal for over two years or

classified as 'disqualified', the supplier will be eliminated

from the supplier list.

**Management of Key Suppliers**

Exerting an influence on key suppliers is an effective way to

improve their corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance.

Trina Solar formulated ‘Supplier CSR Management Procedures’

to continuously strengthen communication with suppliers

by conducting CSR survey and on-site audit. The procedure

requires key suppliers to sign CSR commitments, so as to

strengthen communication and cooperation with them and

strive to establish a stable, honest and reliable supply chain.

Trina Solar evaluates suppliers risk and identifies risk levels

annually. Trina Solar categories the suppliers whose products

and services are closely related to Trina Solar Sustainable

Development Goals as key suppliers, including:

- Providing products and services related to our goal of

sustainable development, significant environment aspects

or major risks;

- Providing products containing substances being restricted

in use or liable to cause occupational diseases;

- Providing products, equipment and services with a great

effect on our energy performance.

**Suppliers’ Performance Evaluation**

Trina Solar established a ‘Management Regulation for Supply

Chain Business Performance Evaluation’, which evaluated the

suppliers’ performance in terms of quality, cost, delivery, service,

innovation etc.. The suppliers were periodically evaluated based

on their risk levels, including monthly evaluation, quarterly

evaluation or random evaluation. Based on the results of the

evaluation, we divided the suppliers into categories of five-star,

four-star, three-star, two-star and one-star, which represented

excellent, good, general, pending improvement and disqualified

suppliers respectively. We awarded suppliers the Annual

Excellent Supplier Award, Quality Excellence Award, Technology

Innovation Award etc. based on their annual performance

evaluation, so that we turned one-way guidance into the

active two-way collaboration and communication. Thus we

gradually enhanced the suppliers’ performance in all aspects.

We regularly conducted supplier training, counseling and

improvement programs to improve the suppliers' capabilities.

For suppliers with lower stars, we focused on communication

and counseling to encourage improvement. For the suppliers

having no improvement for a long time, we gradually reduced

the purchase volume, froze the procurement, or up to disqualify

them.

In 2018, we added intellectual property (IP) clauses in the

company's standard contract template to enhance the supplier's

IP protection awareness and improve their IP protection

management skill.

**Conflict-free Minerals**

“Conflict minerals” refer to metallic minerals, such as tin, tantalum,

tungsten, gold and cobalt exploited from Democratic Republic

of Congo and surrounding nations, which may produce serious

problems regarding human rights and environment during exploit

and sales. Trina Solar has put its policy, systems and processes

in place to ensure that its supply chains are conflict-free. We are

committed to sourcing only materials from environmentally and

socially responsible suppliers. We highly focus on conflict minerals

and work diligently with suppliers to promote sustainable

development by way of ethical sourcing. The copper strips, coated

with tin, are used in the production process of PV modules. We

have proactively taken actions since we realized that there is a

possibility of conflict:

- Formulate formal conflict mineral management policy;

- Establish management system and conduct conflict mineral

survey for supply chain;

- Organize conflict mineral training for key suppliers;

- Inquire all suppliers to sign formal agreement to promise

no conflict mineral in their products, and deliver the

requirement to downstream suppliers.

**Cooperation for Win-win Situation**

Trina Solar not only pays attention to its own green

development, but also takes initiative to convey its vision and

**Employees' Health**

In 2017, Trina Solar launched a wonderful welfare platform based on
its existing flexible welfare program. Employees can choose their own

welfare items for themselves and their families according to their own

needs, such as telephone-doctor, physical examination, critical illness

insurance, accident insurance and other self-paying programs, to
meet their different hearth-care needs. Employees are given their own

decision-making rights to guarantee their welfare so that they can

fully be engaged in enjoyment of work and life.

In order to facilitate relationships between parents and children,

Trina Solar persists in conducting parents-children activities

to benefit children's physical and mental health, such as Trina

children summer camp, art training class, painting and calligraphy

show, parent-child reading club, mother's day activities, etc. The

activities are both fun and entertaining. The activities not only

help promote emotional communication between parents and

children, but also allow employees pay more attention to their

children’s healthy growth.

In order to popularize local cultures and enrich employees’ cultural

life outside of work, we prepare various activities to celebrate local

traditional festivals. Moreover, we also have reading clubs, Tai
chi classes, and Yoga classes and flower arrangement classes for

female employees. The relaxing, soft movements can help people

calm down amidst the hustle and bustle of life, cultivating their

minds and making them more confident in their work and life.

**Listen to Employees**

We value the communication and participation of

employees, and encourage them to join the Labor Union.

We have established a variety of efficient and transparent

communication channels within the company to build

multi-channel and multi-level employee communication,

so as to promote culture construction and allow

employees to fully exercise their democratic rights as a

real member of the company.

We respond to the questions raised by employees and try

to resolve them promptly. For the problems that cannot be

resolved temporarily, we will acknowledge the problems
and admit that the company will try to find a way to address

them, so as to win employees’ recognition and forgiveness.

Employees with sound physical and mental health

will have a higher work enthusiasm and work

efficiency. Trina Solar continuously pays attention

to employees’ mental and physical health. We strive

to create an efficient, relaxed and caring work

environment for our employees, and help them

make a good balance between work and life, so as to

improve their work performance and quality of life.

We have established an internal clinic to provide the employees

with medical and health counseling services. We regularly organize

health examination for employees and annual health checkup for

female employees to show our caring for them. We also provide

free traditional acupuncture therapy for employees. In brief, we do

our utmost to create a healthy, safe and comfortable workplace for

all employees and help them improve their work performance and

quality of life.
