plug illustrated in the sketch. A
temporary adapter that looks like
the adapter illustrated in the sketch
may be used to connect
this plug to a 2-pole receptacle,
as shown, if a properly grounded
outlet is not available. The
temporary adapter should be
used only until a properly grounded
outlet (sketch) can be installed
by a qualified electrician. The green colored rigid ear, lug or the like extending
from the adapter must be connected to a permanent ground such as a properly
grounded outlet box cover. Whenever the adapter is used, it must be held in

**Replacing the 4** **[th]** **Stage Carbon filter:**

1. Loosen the nut on the clamp of the carbon canister **(Figure 1)** and remove the used canister from the lower
housing. It is recommended that the canister be placed into a DOT-approved, appropriately-sized container,
and sealed. (A 55-gallon DOT metal drum may be the most convenient and cost effective). The used
carbon canister should be placed into the shipping container immediately upon removal from the Bulb
Eater [®] 3. Once the canister is removed, a determination should be made of the waste type in accordance
with applicable local, state, and federal regulations. Also, be sure to manage, store, and label the container
accordingly.
2. Apply silicone grease on the O-ring and place O-ring and the clamp on the new carbon canister. **(Figure 2)**
Hold the carbon canister up to the lower housing and tighten the clamp all the way (2 persons required for
installation). **Figure 3**
3. A new flash drive will come with your new carbon canister filter and must be installed to the control panel to
reset the carbon filter lifetime.
4. Call Air Cycle Corporation (800-909-9709) for a proposal for the processing of the used carbon canister. The
most cost effective way to handle the canister is to include it with the pick-up of your drum(s) of crushed
lamps.

Operating Tips

1. Do not force lamps down the entry tube. The Bulb Eater’s vacuum suction should be sufficient to pull the
lamps into the machine.
2. Ensure that you always crush lamps using appropriately sized entry tubes to minimize external breakage.
[Entry tubes are available at www.aircycle.com for a wide variety of lamp sizes.](http://www.aircycle.com/)
3. If you are crushing lamps with significantly blackened ends, feed the lamps blackened end first. These
portions of glass are slightly weaker and more prone to breakage outside the machine.
4. Crushing lamps that have previously been taped together can result in a buildup of adhesive in the Bulb
Eater [®] 3 entry tubes and cause breakage. Remove the entry tube from the machine and clean the inside of
the tube with a rag soaked in an appropriate solvent like paint thinner.

Frequently Asked Questions

# Bulb Eater [®] 3 users typically find the machine very easy to set up and use. However, we recognize that

sometimes our customers have questions about their machines. Below is a list of frequently asked questions
that address many common inquiries that we receive. If you require additional assistance please feel free to
[contact us at any time by phone at 800.909.9709 or 708.344.7860, through email at info@aircycle.com, or by](mailto:info@aircycle.com)
[visiting www.aircycle.com/resources/FAQ.](http://www.aircycle.com/resources/FAQ)

**What type of lamps can I crush with the Bulb Eater** **[®]** **3?**
All models of the Bulb Eater [®] 3 will crush any size linear/straight fluorescent lamps. In addition to these, the
CFL/U-tube chute allows for crushing u-tube and compact fluorescent lamps. U-tube and compact fluorescent
lamps should only be crushed using machines designed to crush the specific lamp type.

**What dangerous materials are in fluorescent lamps?**
Lamps contain many different components and materials, but the only one that is toxic is mercury. Each lamp
typically contains 10-20 mg of mercury, some of which is evaporated. However, other components and
materials of the lamp, such as the glass or powdered phosphors, can be contaminated by the mercury during
the life of the lamp.

More information on mercury and disposal regulations can be found in the reference section of this manual.

**How does the Bulb Eater** **[®]** **3 remove mercury while crushing lamps?**
Your Bulb Eater [®] 3 will remove virtually all airborne powder and mercury vapor while crushing a lamp (over
99%). The Bulb Eater [®] 3 filters the exhaust air in five stages, with a cyclone filter, a cartridge filter, two High
Efficiency Particulate Arrestor (HEPA) filters, and an activated carbon filter. The first stage cyclonic filter
removes about 90% of the dust and larger particles from the air. The second stage cartridge filter removes
99% of the dust and larger particles from the air. The third stage HEPA filters out the remaining small
particles. The HEPA has been shown to capture at least 99.97% of powder with particle sizes of 0.3 microns or
greater. The Bulb Eater [®] 3 filters mercury-containing vapors through a filter of activated carbon.

**How will I know when to change filters?**
2 [nd] Stage Cartridge filter: required to be changed when the fault code 13 is displayed on the LCD screen. The
# Bulb Eater [®] 3 must be operated with the cartridge filter in place or the HEPA filter will be prematurely plugged.

3 [rd] Stage HEPA filter: required to be changed when the fault code 11 is displayed on the LCD screen.

4 [th] Stage Carbon filter: The carbon filter will require changing when filter life times out (1,500 hrs.). Fault code
01 will be displayed on the LCD screen.

5 [th] Stage HEPA filter: required to be changed when the fault code 09 is displayed on the LCD screen.

Keep in mind crushing bulbs with heavy dust or other materials on them may require filters to be changed more
often than the guidelines above.

Refer to page 16 of the owner’s manual for filter-replacement instructions.

800.909.9709

www.AirCycle.com [20]

**Does the spinner assembly need to be changed?**
The spinner chain assembly should be changed when uneven wear causes excessive vibration to the
machine.

Refer to the Maintenance & Troubleshooting section of the owner’s manual for spinner-changing instructions.

**What do I do when my drum is full?**
First, let the machine sit “off” for at least 15 minutes before opening the lid. This allows for dust to settle inside
the drum. Once the Bulb Eater [®] 3 is removed from the top of the drum, it is strongly recommended that the
drum be resealed as quickly as possible (within 10 seconds of removal of machine from drum) to minimize
potential release of remaining mercury vapors present inside the drum.

[Once your drum is full, call Air Cycle at 800.909.9709 or visit www.aircycle.com/services to schedule a pickup.](http://www.aircycle.com/services.com)

**How can I order more filters or other replacement parts?**
[Visit www.aircycle.com](http://www.aircycle.com/) or call 800.909.9709 or 708.344.7860 to order more filters and replacement parts.

**What safety precautions should I take when operating the Bulb Eater** **[®]** **3?**
Because of possible lamp breakage outside of the drum, suitable eye protection and protective gloves must be
worn at all times while the machine is in operation. Proper ear protection (such as the provided ear plugs)
should also be worn at all times when operating the Bulb Eater [®] 3. Wearing steel-toed safety shoes and
disposal overalls is recommended when changing out drums or moving full drums around for storage or
pickup. Take care when lifting and moving drums of crushed lamps, as a full drum can weigh over 500 lbs.
Before using the machine it is extremely important for the operator to review and understand all instructions
and safety precautions. Refer to the Operation Instructions in this manual for detailed information and
procedures.

**How should I clean up broken bulbs?**

1. Carefully scoop up glass fragments and powder using stiff paper or cardboard -- DO NOT use a
traditional vacuum or broom as these may spread the mercury-bearing phosphor powder.
2. Place fragments and powder in the drum with crushed lamps.
3. Use tape or a wet paper towel to clean up remaining fragments and powder.
4. Place tape or paper towel in a securely sealed zip-top bag and place bag on top of full drum of
crushed lamps with spent filters.

**What regulatory restrictions apply to operating the Bulb Eater** **[®]** **3?**
As a part of staying compliant with EPA and OSHA regulations, Air Cycle recommends that the operator of the
Bulb Eater [®] 3 should be trained on how to properly operate and maintain the equipment and crush no more
than two full drums of lamps per 8-hour work shift in a well-ventilated work area. Users/operators of the Bulb
Eater [®] 3 may opt to process more lamps given that appropriate monitoring is performed.

Crushing lamps is a regulated activity by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Air Cycle
Corporation strongly urges all Bulb Eater [®] 3 customers to thoroughly research all regulations that may apply to
crushing, storage, shipping, labeling, employee training, and other crushing-related activities at their facility.

Detailed environmental and regulatory information can be found in the Mercury Information appendix beginning
on page 24.

Mercury Information

**Controlled Crushing Regulations**
Crushing lamps with the Bulb Eater [®] 3 is considered “controlled crushing” and is regulated under both federal
and state hazardous and universal waste regulations. The federal universal waste regulations do not authorize
on-site crushing of fluorescent lamps but do allow the states to write rules that will permit crushing on-site. The
States of Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia have all
passed rules that allow persons to crush lamps on-site under the universal waste regulations. Please verify
with your state regulatory agency that these rules still apply.

In states that allow crushing and classify crushed lamps as universal wastes, persons can generally store their
waste lamps on-site for up to one year, can ship waste lamps off-site with a bill of lading rather than a
hazardous waste manifest, and need not include their lamps when calculating their hazardous waste totals.

Under state and federal hazardous waste regulations, controlled crushing is considered treatment. The
hazardous waste rules typically require a person who treats wastes to obtain a permit. Federal and most state
hazardous waste rules, however, exempt from the permit requirement persons who treat their wastes “within a
drum, tank, or container.” (See 40 CFR 262.34).

Air Cycle Corporation believes The Bulb Eater [®] systems fall squarely within this exemption and many states
have acknowledged in letters to Air Cycle Corporation that the accumulation tank exemption applies to The
Bulb Eater [®] 3 systems. You should be aware, however, that the States of California, Maine, Massachusetts
(SQG and LQG generators), Connecticut, Rhode Island, Missouri, Vermont, New Hampshire, West Virginia,
Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New Jersey have more narrow exemptions to the permitting
requirements (permits are often more easily obtained in Michigan and New Jersey). It is Air Cycle’s
understanding that persons within the states not listed above as requiring a permit or as regulated under
universal waste regulations are authorized to crush lamps within general hazardous waste regulations. Air
Cycle Corporation suggests you contact representatives of those states before proceeding with on-site
crushing. Please note that regardless of whether the lamps are managed as universal or hazardous wastes,
you must properly dispose of the crushed lamps preferably by shipping the crushed lamps to a permitted
recycling facility.

Air Cycle Corporation will continue to work with state lawmakers and the Association of Lighting and Mercury
Recyclers to promote legislation, which will authorize persons to crush lamps under universal waste
regulations. Air Cycle Corporation and its customers know that persons are able to safely crush their lamps to
reduce volume, minimize handling, cut costs, and create a safer work environment by managing their crushed
lamps under either universal waste regulations or existing state hazardous waste regulations. For more
[information on regulations in your state, please visit www.aircycle.com/resources/state-regulations.](http://www.aircycle.com/resources/state-regulations)

**Why is mercury an environmental concern?**
Mercury is a metallic element that can accumulate in living tissue. In sufficient concentrations, mercury may
cause adverse health effects. Sources of mercury in the environment from human activity include coal-burning
power plants, batteries, and fluorescent and HID lamps.

Small amounts of mercury are a necessary component in fluorescent and HID lamps, but when a lamp is
broken, crushed, or dispensed in a landfill or incinerator, mercury may be released to the air, surface water, or
groundwater. Considering this, it is a good policy to keep the mercury in fluorescent and HID lamps out of the
solid waste stream by recycling.

**How do I know if my waste is hazardous?**
All generators of waste, except households, are responsible for determining if their waste is hazardous under
current state and federal regulations. Hazardous wastes can either be included on specific lists or exhibit
hazardous characteristics. This determination can be done by knowledge of the waste or by testing the waste.

800.909.9709

www.AirCycle.com [24]

**What’s hazardous?**
Persons who generate wastes are responsible for determining whether their wastes are hazardous. One
common method for determining whether a waste is hazardous is the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching
Procedure (TCLP) test. The TCLP test is a laboratory test that simulates the potential leaching of hazardous
wastes under conditions typically found in municipal solid waste landfills. If the concentration of mercury in
water that is passed through a sample of crushed fluorescent lamp fragments exceeds 0.2 mg/liter, the
crushed lamp fragments are classified as a hazardous waste. (See test method 1311 in “Test Methods for
Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/ Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication SW846 for more information about the
TCLP procedures.)

In most cases, standard fluorescent lamps and lamp fragments fail the TCLP test and are considered
hazardous wastes. Facilities should treat the spent lamps and lamp fragments as hazardous wastes unless
they test the spent lamps and fragments and determine that the wastes are non-hazardous. Facilities should
manage the spent lamps as hazardous waste according to applicable federal, state, and local requirements.

New low-mercury lamps have been introduced into the market. While these lamps may pass the TCLP test and
be considered non-hazardous, some states - like Minnesota and Vermont - still prohibit persons from disposing
of even these non-hazardous lamps in a solid waste landfill. You may want to talk with a State EPA
representative to find out how you may handle spent lamps in your state.

Please note that regardless of whether the State in which you are located allows you to dispose of lamps in
your dumpster with other non-hazardous trash, the lamps do contain mercury and mercury vapors are released
into our environment when you throw lamps in the trash. Typically, the lamps break in the dumpsters, during
transportation or in the landfill and release mercury into the air or groundwater. These hazardous releases are
a risk to surrounding communities.

Facilities that throw their spent lamps in the trash thinking they are saving money may be mistaken. Throwing
spent lamps in the trash may result in the person being held responsible for the cleanup of a remote and costly
Superfund site. Because of the potential liability under Superfund, Air Cycle Corporation believes facilities that
decide to recycle their spent lamps are making a smart decision that benefits not only the environment but also
the bottom line.

**What are universal wastes?**
Universal wastes are specific hazardous waste streams that facilities can choose to manage in an alternative
manner in place of the more complex hazardous waste requirements. These wastes are typically generated by
many facilities and are often not properly managed under hazardous waste regulations.

Universal Wastes include:
Lamps - Including fluorescent, high intensity discharge (HID), sodium vapor, mercury vapor, neon, and
incandescent lamps Batteries - Including spent dry cell and lead-acid batteries Pesticides - Including certain
suspended, canceled, or unused pesticides Devices containing elemental mercury - Including thermostats,
switches, thermometers, manometers, barometers, and various medical devices.

**Does quantity matter?**
Yes. RCRA (hazardous waste) requirements differ according to the amounts of hazardous waste generated
per month by the facility. There are three main categories of hazardous waste generators:

Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators (CESQG’s) are persons who generate 220 lbs. per month or
less of all hazardous wastes combined (not just lamps!). These generators are exempt from most of the
hazardous waste regulations, which include transportation, treatment, and disposal requirements. They must
not, however, store more than 2200 lbs. of hazardous waste on site at any time and must dispose of their
hazardous waste in facilities that are permitted or authorized to accept hazardous or non-hazardous wastes.
Many states acknowledge CESQG exemptions for paperwork, but not for disposal. Many states do not allow
CESQG to dispose of hazardous waste in a solid waste landfill.

800.909.9709
www.AirCycle.com [25]

Small Quantity Generators (SQG) are persons who generate 220 to 2200 lbs. of hazardous waste per month.
These generators must keep proper records of the waste, report to EPA, and follow accumulation
requirements. These generators can store up to 6 months without a storage permit.

Large Quantity Generators (LQG) generate more than 2200 lbs. of hazardous waste per month. These
generators are subject to the full hazardous waste management requirements. These generators cannot store
hazardous wastes on site for more than 90 days (3 months) without obtaining a storage permit.

There are 2 categories of Universal Waste handlers:

1. Small Quantity Handler - Generator who accumulates less than 11,000 lbs. of universal waste
(batteries, pesticides, thermostats, or lamps) at any time.
2. Large Quantity Handler - Generator who accumulates more than 11,000 lbs. of universal waste
(batteries, pesticides, thermostats, or lamps) at any time.

Universal Waste Storage Limits:

Both Small and Large Quantity Generators of Universal Waste can generally store their Universal
Waste for one year. (For more information please contact your state Environmental Protection Agency
or Air Cycle Corporation.)

**Mercury Emissions**
The disposal of mercury-containing fluorescent lamps and the potential for emissions is of concern because
mercury is a highly toxic metal that bio-accumulates through the food chain. Mercury also has a low vapor
pressure of 2 x 10-3 mm (at 25oC) and readily evaporates to form mercury vapor at room temperature.
Therefore, emissions of mercury in liquid or vapor form require health and environmental consideration. The
volatilization is especially significant with respect to human health, as it results in ambient mercury vapor that
can be absorbed into the human body through various pathways. These include direct inhalation, ingestion
through surface contamination, and absorption through the skin of elemental mercury. Generally, excessive
exposure to various forms of mercury has been shown to adversely affect the human central nervous system,
lungs, kidneys, skin, and reproductive system.

**Local Effects**
Mercury is a primary irritant of the skin and mucous membranes. It may occasionally be a skin sensitizer in
some individuals.

**Systemic Effects**
Acute (short-term) poisoning due to mercury vapors adversely affects the lungs primarily, in the form of acute
interstitial pneumonitis, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis.

Chronic (long-term) exposure to lower mercury levels over prolonged periods of time produces symptoms that
can vary widely from individual to individual. These may include weakness, fatigability, loss of appetite, loss of
weight, insomnia, indigestion, diarrhea, metallic taste in the mouth, increased salivation, soreness of mouth or
throat, inflammation of gums, black line at the gums, loosening of teeth, irritability, loss of memory, and tremors
of fingers, eyelids, lips, or tongue. In general, chronic mercury exposure produces four classical signs:
gingivitis, excessive salivation, increased irritability, and muscular tremors. Rarely are all four seen together in
an individual case. More extensive exposures to excessive mercury levels, either by daily exposures or onetime, can produce extreme irritability, excitability, anxiety, delirium with hallucinations, melancholia, manicdepressive psychosis, and adverse effects on the reproductive organs. Either acute or chronic exposure may
produce permanent changes to affected organs and organ systems. Excessive exposure to various forms of
mercury has been shown to adversely affect the human central nervous system, kidneys, and reproductive
system.

Table 1 (page 28) provides a summary of the clinical importance of various forms of mercury.

**Abrasion and Cut Hazards**
The primary hazard resulting from handling broken lamps or crushing lamps is the potential release of airborne
glass particulates resulting in skin, eye, and respiratory tract irritation with the possibility for cuts and
lacerations to the eye, skin, and respiratory tract tissue upon contact. The eyes and skin can also be cut or
lacerated by sharp glass edges or metal components contained in the crushed lamp waste.

**Crushing Hazards**
Perhaps the greatest potential for physical injury during the Bulb Eater® use other than laceration from broken
glass or metal components is physical injury from movement or mishandling of the 55-gallon drums. Thus,
forklifts or other suitable lifting devices equipped with drum grabbers and drum cradles must be used for
transporting, moving, and positioning the lamp waste collection drums when filled with crushed fluorescent
lamps. It is also extremely important that the manual be followed closely. Failure to operate the machine
properly could lead to dangerous mercury vapor exposure. While boxing intact lamps intact, be careful to avoid
breaking the lamps. When intact lamps break, unfiltered vapors are released.

**Other**
A review of manufacturers’ fluorescent lamp Product Safety Data Sheets (PSDS) reveal there are no known
health hazards from exposure to lamps that are intact. The PSDSs further disclose that no adverse effects are
expected from occasional exposure to broken lamps but stated, “Avoid prolonged or frequent exposure to
broken lamps unless there is adequate ventilation.” The PSDSs indicate that the major hazard from an
occasional broken lamp is the possibility of sustaining glass cuts.

**Environmental Effects**
Additionally, mercury is harmful to the environment. Mercury bio accumulates in the food chain and as such
poses many of the adverse effects described on the human body during the consumption of mercury
contaminated food (e.g., predator fish - swordfish, tuna, etc.) Mercury in the environment is deposited and
revolatilized many times, with a residence time in the atmosphere of a few days.

Most mercury-containing fluorescent lamps must be recycled or disposed as a toxic characteristic hazardous
waste as defined in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA). This is due to the concentration of the mercury and/or other toxic metal content in the waste typically
exceeding EPA’s Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) limits quantified by TCLP analytical tests.

The most environmentally sound and preferred disposal method for spent fluorescent lamps is recycling.
Fluorescent lamp recycling allows the mercury to be separated from the other fluorescent lamp components
(e.g. glass, metal, etc.) and collected for reutilization.

Mercury Standards

Occupational Safety and Health Standards
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation Title 29 of the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) 1910.1000, Air Contaminants, Table Z-2, and an OSHA Compliance Directive Interpretation
of 9 September 1996 regarding mercury exposure limits has set the Permissible Exposure (PEL) for all forms
of mercury at 0.10 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3) of air (equivalent to 6.1 parts per billion, ppb). The
Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) is an eight-hour Time Weighted Average (TWA) concentration limit in air that
nearly all workers can be exposed to without adverse health effects. The American Conference of
Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical
Agents for 2001 has set recommended air standards for the elemental and inorganic forms of mercury
(including inorganic mercury vapor) at 0.025 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3) as an eight-hour Threshold
Limit Value (TLV) Time Weighted Average (TWA) concentration in air. A “Skin” notation is also designated with
the standard indicating skin, eye and mucous membrane contact as a significant pathway of absorption.
