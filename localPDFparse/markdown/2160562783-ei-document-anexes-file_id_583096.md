Date of calibration: 20 September 2023

Postcode: 7770563

Country: Chile

Notes:

**As public evidence was available, from a testing organisation responsible for approving the results of pattern**
**evaluation tests, to demonstrate that the model of sound calibrator fully conformed to the requirements for**
**pattern evaluation described in Annex A of IEC 60942:2017, the sound calibrator tested is considered to conform**
**to all the Class 2 requirements of IEC 60942:2017.**

**Notes**

This certificate is issued in accordance with the laboratory accreditation requirements of the United Kingdom Accreditation Service. UKAS is one of the
signatories to the Multilateral Agreement of the European co-opeation for Accreditation (EA) for the mutual recognition of calibration certificates issued
by accredited laboratories. The United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) is one of the signatories to the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) Arrangement for the mutual recognition of calibration certificates. It provides traceability of measurement to the SI system of units
and/or to units of measurement realised at the National Physical Laboratory or other recognised national metrology institutes. This certificate may not be
reproduced other than in full, except with the prior written approval of the issuing laboratory. The results within this certificate relate only to the items
calibrated. The reported expanded uncertainty is based on a standard uncertainty multiplied by a coverage factor k=2, providing a coverage probability
of approximately 95%. The uncertainty evaluation has been carried out in accordance with UKAS requirements.

**Calibration procedure**

The sound calibrator under test has been calibrated to the published data as described in the operating manual and in
the half-inch configuration.

The procedures and techniques used are as described in IEC 60942:2017 Annex B - Periodic Tests. Firstly, five
determinations of the sound pressure level were made using the Reference calibrator. Then, five determinations of the
sound pressure level, frequency and total distortion were made using the calibrator under test.

**Measurements**

Reference calibrator SPL: 94.03 dB

|Configuration|Col2|Output Level (dB)|Frequency (Hz)|Total distortion (%)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|94 dB|Measured|94.00|1000.3|1.6|
