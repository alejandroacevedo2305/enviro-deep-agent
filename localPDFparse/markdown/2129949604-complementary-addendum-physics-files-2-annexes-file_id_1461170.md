Abstract: Atmospheric aerosol constitute one of the most challenging issues in environmental research. The main
physico-chemical characteristics, sources and effects of this pollutant are briefly reported in this paper,
together with some experimental results regarding the strength of the main emission sources and formation
pathways. The relevant role of the dilution properties of the atmosphere in driving the mass concentration of
atmospheric particulate matter and in determining high pollution events is elucidated. Some episodes of
biomass burning pollution and desert dust long-range transport are discussed.

### 1 PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is generally defined as a mixture of solid and/or liquid particles
that remains individually dispersed in the air. Atmospheric PM can be emitted by a wide variety of sources that
influence its physical properties (size, surface area, density), chemical composition and size distribution. In
particular, PM may be classified as primary or secondary in accordance with its formation mechanism: primary
particles are directly emitted into the atmosphere while secondary particles are formed after chemical
transformation of their gaseous precursors.

PM may vary in size from a few nanometers to several tenths of micrometers. Its typical size
distribution, shown in Figure 1, includes three different modes, differing also in terms of generation process
(John, 2001). The nucleation mode (or ultrafine particle mode) includes particles having equivalent diameter
below 0.1 μm, which are formed by the homogenous nucleation of precursor gases and from combustion
processes. The accumulation mode includes particles in the range 0.1 -1 μm, formed by coagulation of particles
in the nucleation mode and by condensation of gaseous species on the surface of pre-existing particles. The
coarse mode (over 1 μm) includes particles formed by mechanical processes, such as erosion of the earth
surface (mineral dust) and of other materials, including the ocean surface (sea spray).

Ultrafine particles have the highest number density, while particles in the coarse mode are characterized
by high mass density. Although the coarse mode is dominated by primary particles, also secondary particles
formed by the chemical interaction of gases with primary particles of crustal or marine origin can be found in
this mode.

Particles residence time in the atmosphere also depends on their size. Owing to the effect of gravity,
coarse particles are rapidly removed from the air by sedimentation (residence time between some minutes and
some hours); also, particles in the nucleation mode are rapidly transformed into coarser particles by coagulation
processes. The highest residence time in the atmosphere (up to some weeks) is shown by particles in the
accumulation mode, which can be easily transported by the wind up to thousands of kilometres from the area
where they are formed.

Atmospheric particles are characterised by various shapes: from the rough-edge shape of a crustal
particle (Figure 2a), to the long branched chains of small nanoparticles characterizing Diesel exhausts emission

crystal (Figure 2d).

### 2 SOURCES AND EFFECTS

Sources of particulate matter can be natural or anthropogenic. Naturally occurring particles are produced
by volcanoes, sea spray, grassland fires, desert dust and by a variety of biological sources (pollen, bacteria,
fungal spores, fragments of vegetable organisms and of animals). Anthropogenic particles derive from human
activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, domestic heating, power plants and industrial
processes. Averaged over the globe, anthropogenic PM accounts for about 10% of the total aerosol amount.
According to its source, PM has a different chemical composition. For example, wind-blown mineral dust tends
to be made of mineral oxides and other material blown from the earth's crust, sea spray, considered the secondlargest contributor in the global aerosol budget, reflects the composition of sea water and consists mainly of
sodium chloride, car exhausts mainly emit elemental carbon. A relevant fraction of atmospheric PM is
constituted by secondary inorganic particles, which mostly derive from the oxidation of primary gases such as
sulphur and nitrogen oxides, leading, respectively to sulphuric and nitric acid; in the presence of ammonia,
these species form ammonium salts (ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate). Secondary organic particles,
instead, may be formed from the reaction (mainly oxidation) of biogenic emitted species (volatile organic
carbon compounds).

It is widely recognised that atmospheric PM influence climate through at least two main pathways: its
effect on both the absorption and scattering of solar radiation and its role in cloud formation processes. The
interaction of aerosol particles with the solar radiation depends on its chemical composition. For example,
elemental carbon is one of the most important aerosol species absorbing solar radiation, while sulphate exhibits
the opposite behaviour. The ability of the atmospheric aerosol to influence the way solar radiation is
transmitted through the atmosphere has relevant consequences in terms of radiation budget and thus in terms of
climate change.

PM deposition exerts a significant influence on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Deposition of acid
pollutants such as sulphuric acid contributes to soil acidification with adverse effects on forests and crop
cultivation and on the economy. Enhances rates of nitrates deposition, instead, contributes to the eutrophication
of aquatic ecosystems, causing a negative impact on the life of aquatic animals.

The effects of PM on human health, widely studied in the last twenty years, include asthma, lung cancer
and cardiovascular issues. A sound relationship has been found between current PM 10 concentration in ambient
air and the number of hospitalizations and deaths due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The threat of
atmospheric particles to health depends on their size, shape and, again, chemical composition. The size of a
particle determines the portion of the respiratory tract where it will rest when inhaled: PM 10 is able to penetrate
in the bronchi, PM 2.5 in the lung and nanoparticles are able to pass through the lungs and enter the circulatory
system (Dockery and Stone, 2007; Perez et al., 2009).

### 3 CHEMICAL COMPOSITION

During recent years, substantial improvements have been carried out in the chemical characterisation
and identification of the main atmospheric aerosol components (Viana et al., 2008). All the individual inorganic
species typically representing more than 1% of the total PM mass can be easily determined and their main
sources identified: crustal elements (silicon, aluminium, iron, calcium, carbonate), sea-salt aerosol (sodium
chloride), inorganic secondary species (nitrate, sulphate ammonium), primary anthropogenic species (elemental
carbon).

Much more complex is the situation for organic compounds, as this class constitutes a relevant fraction
of PM mass (20 - 60%) but includes a wide variety of individual species, each one at very low concentration
level. Organic matter can be measured as a whole, but only a small part of the species that constitute this group
can be determined individually; this is the reason why the monitoring of organic species in PM is generally
addressed only to harmful (toxic and carcinogenic) compounds or to specific species that can be considered as
tracers of specific PM emission sources.

A reliable sampling procedure for the determination of PM chemical composition involves the
simultaneous collection of a specific PM size fraction (e.g. PM 10 or PM 2.5 ) on one Teflon and one quartz filter
membranes. After the sampling, the PM mass concentration is determined on the Teflon filter by the
gravimetric procedure or by an equivalent method such as the beta attenuation method. Quartz filters are

37

analysed for their elemental carbon and organic carbon content (EC/OC) by means of a thermo-optical
analyser. Teflon filters are analysed for their metal content (Al, Si, Fe, Na, K, Mg, Ca, S and some
microcomponents) by energy-dispersion X-ray fluorescence, a non-destructive technique; then they are

identified and quantified and a general picture of the aerosol composition obtained (Perrino et al., 2007, 2009).

The comparison between the PM 10 mass and the sum of the individual macro-components is shown in
Figure 3 for a series of daily samples collected in a peri-urban area in the vicinity of Rome during the winter of
2007. The chemical analysis of macro-components allowed the reconstruction, on average, of about 98% of the
PM mass.

To have a comprehensive view on the main sources of PM, the main chemical components (ions,
elements, elemental carbon and organic carbon) can be been grouped into five classes, which reflects the five
main PM sources: soil (crustal components), sea, combustion (primary anthropogenic compounds), atmosphere
(secondary inorganic pollutants) and biosphere (organics). The contribution of soil is calculated by adding the
concentration of elements (as metal oxides) generally associated with mineral dust (Al, Si, Fe, K, Ca, Mg and
Na oxides); sea-salt is calculated from the concentration of soluble sodium and chloride and of minor sea-water
components (sulphate, magnesium, calcium, potassium); the contribution of combustion sources is mainly
constituted by elemental carbon; non-sea-salt sulphate, nitrate and ammonium constituted the secondary
inorganic fraction; organic matter (organic carbon multiplied by a factor that takes into account the non-carbon
content of organic molecules) constitute the contribution of the biosphere (Perrino et al., 2009).

The day-by-day concentration of these five groups of components during the same study shown in
Figure 3 is reported in Figure 4. The average composition during the whole year 2007 is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Average chemical composition of PM 10 during 2007 in a peri-urban site in the vicinity of Rome.

PM composition shows a wide variability in space and time. In North-African arid regions, for example,
the contribution of soil may exceed half of the total PM 10 mass even on a monthly basis, while Italian coastal
regions may experience daily sea-spray contributions up to 30 - 40%; the concentration of primary
anthropogenic components steadily decreases when moving from traffic sites or industrial areas towards urban
background, semi-rural and regional background location, while the distribution of secondary compounds, due
to their peculiar formation mechanism, is almost homogeneous over a regional scale. In Italy, the contribution
of crustal matter increase during the spring and the summer, due to more frequent Saharan dust intrusions and
to the higher dryness of the soil that enhance particle re-suspension, while the contribution of organics increase
during the warm period.

The relevance of one of the main sources of organic particles can be estimated by determining levoglucosan, a
sound and specific tracer of the emission from domestic wood burning. Levoglucosan is a monosaccharide derivatives
produced by the thermal degradation product of cellulose. The molecule is stable and emitted at such high
concentrations (11-17% of the total emitted organic carbon) that it can be detected at considerable distances
from the original combustion source; moreover, it is produced by the combustion of hard wood and not of
leaves. For all these reasons, levoglucosan can be considered a reliable tracer of residential wood burning
(Simoneit et al., 1999).

39

Proceedings of a C.I.S.B. Minisymposium - March 2010

Atmospheric pollution studies have shown that levoglucosan represents a remarkable fraction of organic
matter (up to 10%) and that the emission from residential wood burning may constitute up to more than 80% of
the total organic carbon in atmospheric particulate matter. The highest concentrations of this species are
recorded during the winter period: in particular, at sites when domestic biomass burning is supposed to be
relevant, the winter-to-summer ratio is very high (30-40) while it is about one order of magnitude lower at sites
assumed not to be directly influenced by domestic biomass burning. Also, it has been highlighted that the
difference between the winter and summer average concentration of organic carbon is very close to the
difference between winter and summer estimation of domestic biomass burning contribution. In other words,
the emission from fireplace combustion seems to be, by far, the main responsible for the increase of organic
carbon atmospheric concentration during the winter. For example, the data reported in Figure 6, which refer to
a one-month study carried out in a location sited inside an Alpine valley, show that biomass burning was the
most important source of both PM 10 and PM 2.5 during the winter period, and that most of the seasonal
difference in PM mass concentration (about 25 μg/m [3] ) was due to this domestic combustion process.

### 4 DILUTION PROPERTIES OF THE ATMOSPHERE

The knowledge of the dilution properties of the lower air layers is an essential tool for understanding the
accumulation of particulate matter and, in general, the time evolution of pollution processes. The atmospheric
concentration of any pollutant, in fact, depends not only on its emission, transformation and deposition rate but
also on its dilution in the planetary boundary layer. In short, any atmospheric pollution event is the result of a
complex interaction between chemistry and meteorology, that is, between the intensity of pollutants production
and the capacity of the atmosphere to dilute them (Han et al., 2009; Perrino et al., 2008; Vecchi et al., 2007;
Zhang et al., 2009).

We can obtain useful information about the dilution potential of the atmosphere, which is not directly
measured by any standard meteorological procedure, by monitoring the natural radioactivity due to Radon
short-lived decay products. The emission flow of Radon from the ground, in fact, can be considered as constant
in the time and space scale of our observations and Radon air concentration at a given location only depends on
the dilution factor. By determining the natural radioactivity due to the Radon progeny we can obtain a reliable
picture of the dilution properties of the lower atmosphere.

The study of natural radioactivity allows us to identify periods characterised by a weak atmospheric
mixing, which favour the occurrence of anthropogenic primary and secondary pollution events, as well as
periods characterised by advection, during which the air quality improves. Natural pollution events (desert dust,
sea-spray), however, are generally recorded during advection periods.

The example reported in Figure 7 shows how the periods characterised by atmospheric stability (high
night-time maxima and high daytime minima of natural radioactivity, e.g.: November 5-7 and 22-25) lead to an
increase of PM concentration, while during advection periods (constantly low natural radioactivity values, e.g.:
November 7 and 14-16) PM concentration quickly decreases. In general, the shape of the time variations of PM
concentration follows the shape of natural radioactivity pattern.

Figure 7: Time pattern of natural radioactivity and PM 10 concentration in Rome.

In order to make the information contained in the pattern of natural radioactivity more easily perceived
and interpreted, a Daily Dilution Index, able to characterise each day in terms of meteorological predisposition
to the occurrence of a pollution event, has been developed. The Index is a proper combination of natural
radioactivity values and of their time derivatives during the times of the day that favour the occurrence of PM

41

Proceedings of a C.I.S.B. Minisymposium - March 2010

pollution (early morning and evening). The data in Figure 8 show that the Index is very efficient in tracing
PM 10 concentration variations, demonstrating that the dilution properties of the atmosphere is a driving factor
in determining pollution events (Perrino et al., 2009).

results of the DREAM model simulations (lower panel).

The monitoring of natural radioactivity can be used also to evaluate the contribution of natural events to PM
concentration. The identification of natural events is of particular importance, as the European Dire ctives addressing the
limit values for particulate matter provides that days when PM 10 and PM 2.5 limits are exceeded because of
natural events should not be considered in the computation of both the annual concentration value and the
exceedances of the daily concentration value.

Taking the case of Central Italy, one can observe that sea-spray aerosol is generally a minor constituent
of PM 10 (1-3%) and even during the transport of air masses from the sea the increase in PM 10 mass
concentration due to these compounds does not generally exceed 10 ug/m [3] . Crustal components, instead,
generally constitute 10-20% of the PM 10 concentration, and during desert dust events the contribution of these
species to PM 10 may even exceed 100 ug/m [3] . As a consequence, episodes of dust transport from the African
desert, although not frequent, may easily cause exceedances of the limit values.

During the desert dust intrusion of 2-4 December 2004, shown in Figure 9, PM 10 concentration at the
urban background station in Rome reached values close to 100 ug/m [3] (upper panel). The lower panel of Figure
9 reports the results of the simulations run by the DREAM model for December 3 [rd] . The model, developed by
the Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Insular Dynamics (http://www.bsc.es/projects/earthscience/DREAM/),
simulates the atmospheric circulation of desert dust. The calculation of the Daily Dilution Index, reported in the
same graph, was in very good agreement with PM 10 values during the whole month, except, as expected, during
the three days of the episode. The values of the Index calculated for these three days are a sound estimate of the
PM 10 values that would have been recorded in the absence of the event. The chemical analysis of PM
confirmed that the difference between PM 10 concentration and the value of the Index (yellow bars in figure 9)
was due to crustal matter, which during this period constituted more than 50% of PM 10 concentration.
