#### 1.0 INTRODUCTION

Thank you for purchasing an ECOJOHN product. With correct care and regular maintenance, it
will provide years of trouble-free service. Please take a few minutes to read this manual. Then
keep it in a safe place where it can be easily located if needed by your professional service
technician.

The WC32-D12 and WC48-D12 models **(WC)** are fully automatic systems that incinerate black or
grey water from a waste tank. Through the incineration process the black/grey water gets burned
by use of diesel fuel - the only remains will be a small amount of sterile ash. Maintenance and
emptying of ash only needs to be done a few times a year.

The WC is intended to burn solid waste, urine, water, and paper.

**Table 1 - Specification**

#### 2.0 SAFETY

The WC is a safe, convenient appliance when assembled and used properly. However, as with all
diesel-fired products, certain safeguards must be observed. Failure to follow these safeguards
may result in damage or injury. If you have questions concerning assembly or operation, consult

#### 3.0 INSTALLATION

**PRE-INSTALLATION**

1. The installation must conform with the following, as applicable.
a. **The Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standard, Title 24 CFR, Part 32-**
**80 (formerly the Federal Standard for Mobile Home Construction and Safety. Title**
**24, HUD (Part 280), 1975.**
b. **Local codes or, in the absence of local codes, the Standard for Recreational**
**Vehicles, ANSI/NFPA 501C-1977, or ANSI A119.2/NFPA 1192.**

In order to install the WC System, please refer to the instructions below. Install and use the
incinerator and tanks in a dry and well ventilated space.

.

WARNING

**Do not restrict the flow of air to the appliance**
If the WC is not supplied with a reliable combustion air source, the burner cannot properly burn
the fuel. This would result in incomplete combustion, causing sooting and probable emission of
carbon monoxide. Severe personal injury, death or substantial property damage could occur.

**VENTILATION INSTALLATION**

**1. Place WC:** Position WC at desired location. The unit should be positioned at least 5
inches from combustible surfaces. The flue outlet collar should be placed between the
rafters or joists above, if possible.

**2. Frame Support Opening:** Drop a plumb bob to the center of the toilet’s flue outlet and
mark this center point on the ceiling. Cut a hole in the ceiling for the Chimney Pipes.

**Picture 1 - Chimney Installation**

**3. Install Support:** For installation into a flat ceiling, you may use a Firestop.

**Picture 2 - Chimney Installation**

**4. Cut Roof Opening:** Cut an opening in the roof directly above the opening below, and at
least 4 inches larger than the chimney’s outside diameter to provide at least a 2-inch
clearance all around the chimney. The chimney must be centered within the opening and
maintain the 2-inch clearance to combustibles.

5

**5. Assembly Chimney Sections:** Lower the female end of the first Chimney Section
through the Firebox. Twist-lock it clockwise onto the male end of the Anchor Plate on the
WC. Turn Pipe Sections firmly clockwise to lock them together.

**Picture 3 - Chimney Installation**

**6. Install Roof Support:** Use the Adjusted Roof Support to fasten the chimney pipe above
the ceiling or on the roof.

**Picture 4 - Chimney Installation**

**7. Attach Flashing:** In new constructions, assemble the Chimney Sections to a point above
the roof, then slip the Flashing before extending the chimney above the roof. Allow space
to permit sliding the next Chimney Section up through the Flashing. Always insure the
chimney remains vertical (use level), and that at least a 2-inch clearance to combustible
materials is maintained all around. Install the upper edge of the Flashing under the
roofing. Nail to the roof along the upper edge of the Flashing. Be sure to follow local
building practices, as needed. Seal all nail heads with a non-hardening waterproof
sealant. Do not put screws through the Flashing into the Chimney Pipe.

**8. Finish Top:** Apply a high-temperature (500°F), non-hardening wa terproof sealant around
the chimney at the point where the Storm Collar will meet the chimney just above the
Flashing. Slide the Storm Collar down over the chimney to the top of the Flashing.
Tighten and seal the Storm Collar against the sealant. After installing sufficient Chimney
Sections to meet the height requirement, attach the Chimney Cap onto the top of the
chimney by holding the collar of the cap and twist locking it clockwise onto the chimney.
Use and Extended Roof Bracket if the chimney extends more than 5 feet above the roof.

**9. VENTILATION INSTALLATION IS NOW COMPLETE**

NOTICE

If the room where the WC is being installed is unusually tight, or if the room has a ventilation fan,
it is recommended that the combustion air be supplied to the furnace room through intakes from
the outside of the building. The intakes must terminate must terminate facing down in order to
avoid obstruction from rain, snow, leaves, etc. Openings must have one square inch of free area
per 10,000 Btu.

**HOSE/TANKS INSTALLATION**

**1.** Place the water tank at a desirable location.
**2.** Connect a 3⁄4 in. hose to outlet water tank; connect the other end of hose to inlet water
pump or solenoid.
**3.** Connect a 3⁄4 in. hose from outlet water pump or solenoid and connect it to inlet on toilet.
**4.** Connect a 1 in. hose from outlet toilet and connect to inlet of waste tank.
**5.** Repeat step 1-4 for additional toilets.
**6.** Connect a 1 1⁄2 in. hose from outlet on waste pump.
**7.** Connect the hose to the inlet of the WC incinerator.

**8.** DONE

If the waste holding tank is setup higher up than the WC, make sure there is a loop on the hose
from the waste pump that prevents the water pressure to leak through into the burn chamber. If
there is no loop, black water could fill up the burn chamber, which will result in failing burner. The
burner needs air to operate, and a full burn chamber prevents that. On the next page, figure 1-3
shows how the tanks should be setup; figure 4 shows the wrong setup.

**Figure 5 - Layout of System**

**FUEL INSTALLATION**

Connect the fuel line between the WC and fuel tank. Install a Fuel Filter close to the WC. Shutoff
valves should be located in the oil supply line, never in the return line.

WARNING

**OIL LEAK AND FIRE HAZARD**
**Install the oil tank following applicable standards in the U.S. by referring to the latest**
**edition of NFPA 31 or CSA-B139 & CSA-B140 in Canada, and all authorities having**
**jurisdiction.**

CAUTION

**DO NOT USE TEFLON TAPE**
**Damage to the pump could cause impaired burner operation, oil leakage and appliance**
**Soot-up.**

 - Never use Teflon tape on fuel oil fittings

 - Tape fragments can lodge in fuel line components and fuel unit, damaging the equipment
and preventing proper operation

 - Use oil-resistant pipe sealant compounds

**FUEL FILTER**

Install a fuel filter inside the building between the fuel tank and the appliance. Filter should be
rated for 50 microns or less.

CAUTION

**OIL SUPPLY PRESSURE CONTROL REQUIRED**
**Damage to the filter or pump seals could cause oil leakage and a fire hazard.**

 - The oil supply inlet pressure to the burner cannot exceed 3 psig

 - Do not install valves in the return line

 - Gravity Feed Systems: Always install an ant siphon valve in the oil supply line or a
solenoid valve in the pump/nozzle discharge tubing to provide backup oil flow cut-off
protection

**POWER INSTALLATION**

The next step after installing the vent and tanks is to connect the power. The WC runs on
12V DC.

**Caution: Do not reverse these cables or the WC circuit board will be permanently**
**damaged. This is not covered under warranty.**

**START UP SCHEDULE**

1. Check all electrical connections
2. Check fuel connection to make sure it is tightly connected
3. Check vent system
4. Press start if the unit is in Manual mode. If it is in Automatic mode, it will automatically start
up if there is sufficient waste in the waste tank
5. Use a wrench to bleed the burner (if needed) when it tries to ignite. To bleed the pump,
attach a clear plastic hose over the bleed fitting. Loosen the fitting and catch the oil in an
empty container. Tighten the fitting when all air has been purged from the supply system.
**Note:** If the burner stops after a flame is established, the unit probably requires additional
bleeding. Continue to bleed the system until the pump is primed and a flame is established
when the vent fitting is closed. If the burner continues to fail igniting, the air setting may need
to be adjusted - go to the Troubleshooting section.
6. Once the burner has ignited, close burner door.

**START UP IS NOW COMPLETE**

#### 4.0 VENTILATION SYSTEM

**SAFETY**
The chimney is build up by 6’’ (I.D) and 8” (O.D) double-wall modules that are very easy to handle
and mount. The chimney has been closely tested so it is fire resistant, suitable for all kinds of fuel
and appliances and for use at continuous operating temperatures of up to 2100 degrees F. The
chimney surface always keeps a low temperature that never will risk anyone to get burned.

**CURVED CHIMNEY**
It is possible to curve the chimney by 15 or 30 degrees.

**MATERIAL**
A double wall stainless steel material offers the optimum safety and performance. The chimney
modules have a Thermal Tech blanket insulation, which keeps the outer wall from getting hot,
while ensuring high flue gas temperatures for optimum draft performance. The diameter of the
inner liner of chimney model is 4 inches.

**COMPONENTS**
The chimney has standardized module system plus complimentary modules selected to cover
practically all requirements. It is therefore very easy to find a solution for everyone. The top of the
chimney is equipped with a rain cap.

NOTICE

**Periodic Examination of the Venting System is Required**

#### 5.0 OPERATION

**HOW THE SYSTEM OPERATES**

The toilets, water and waste pumps are all controlled by the main control board shown below.

**Picture 5 - Control Board**

11

When the WC is set up and ready for commissioning, the control panel needs to be powered up.
Once the unit has been powered up, the control panel will come on. It will show if the unit is set in
a Manual Mode or Automatic Mode.

**Manual Mode:**
This mode allows you to:
1. Manually control its operation
2. Scroll between various modes and check levels

By pressing **Start/Enter**, the WC will start up and begin to burn. Note: There has to be sufficient
waste in the waste holding tank in order for the unit to start up. If there is a scenario where you
don’t want the unit to burn even though there is sufficient waste in the waste holding tank, you
can shut down the burn cycle by pressing the **Start/Enter** button again.

While being in manual mode, it is possible to scroll the menu and check the status of the unit.
Use the **Menu** button to scroll between the different modes.

**Automatic Mode:**

This mode will either:
1. Start operation if sufficient waste is in the waste holding tank or
2. Be in ready mode awaiting waste to be deposited into the waste holding tank.

In either state, the operation is fully automated and requires no other action other than checking
sufficient fuel (Propane) and water is available.
If the unit is in automatic mode and there is sufficient waste in the waste holding tank, then the
WC will start up automatically. The waste pump will start to pump for a few seconds when the
temperature has reached to a set temperature. Thereafter the temperature is slowly going to rise
until it reaches a new set temperature, where it will shut off and start its cooling down cycle.
When the temperature has dropped again, it will portion in more waste from the waste holding
tank again. This process continues as long as there is waste in the waste tank. As soon as the
level in the waste tank is low, it will shut off the burn process and put itself in standby mode.

**FUNCTIONS OF THE CONTROL BOARD**
Burn in Process - WC is burning
Standby Mode - WC is waiting for waste level to go up or to be started up manually
Cooling Down - Waiting for the burn chamber to cool down
Temp - Reads the current temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius
Tburntime - Total hours and minutes the WC has been burning
Manual Mode/ Automatic Mode - Tells if the unit is set in automatic or manual mode
Level Indicator - This indicator tells you the level of the water, waste tank, and fuel tank (not applicable)
Error - This page displays if there are any error messages on the unit
Service - How many hours before the unit needs to be serviced.

WARNING

**Should overheating occur, do not turn off or disconnect the power to the appliance.**
**Instead, shut off the manual diesel control to the appliance.**

**If the WC fails to operate, see troubleshooting or contact your dealer. If replacement parts**
**are needed, contact your dealer.**

**Figure 7 - Electrode Tip Settings**

WARNING

**B. Replace Burner Nozzle**
Make certain the correct nozzle is selected (consult with your local dealer or GII). Failure
to use the correct nozzle size and type can result in unacceptable combustion, possibly
causing severe personal injury, death or substantial property damage.
1. Place a 3⁄4” open-end wrench on the nozzle adapter. Insert the nozzle into the
adapter and finger tighten. Finish tightening with a 5/8” open-end wrench.

14

2. Remove already installed nozzle and confirm that same nozzle type is being
installed. Verify that the electrode tip settings comply with Figure 3.

**Use care when removing and installing oil nozzles:**
 - Inspect the nozzle adapter prior to installing the nozzle. If the sealing surface is
grooved or scratched, replace the nozzle line assembly. If a damaged nozzle adapter
is not replaced, oil could leak at the nozzle-adapter joint, causing serious combustion
problems.

 - Protect the nozzle orifice and strainer when installing a nozzle. If there is dirt in the
orifice or it is scratched or damaged, the nozzle will not function properly.

 - Do not over-torque the nozzle when installing. This will cause deep grooves in the
nozzle adapter, preventing a seal when a new nozzle is installed.

 - Use a wrench that secures the adapter or use 3/4" and 5/8" open-end wrenches. DO
NOT attempt to remove or install a nozzle without securing the adapter. The nozzle
alignment could be seriously damaged.

 - Do not squeeze the electrodes too tightly when handling the nozzle line assembly.
This could change the electrode tip settings or damage the ceramic electrode
insulators.

**C. Check/Adjust Electrodes**
Check the electrode tip settings. Adjust if necessary to comply with the dimensions show
in Figure 6. To adjust, loosen the electrode clamp screw and slide/rotate electrodes as
necessary. Securely tighten the clamp screw when finished.

**D. Igniter Maintenance**
The igniter assembly does not require any adjustments beyond making sure the springs
and the burner electrode rods make solid contact when the igniter is in the closed
position. The sealing surfaces of the gaskets should be checked and replaced at the first
signs of any damage or deterioration. Clean any dirt of residue from the porcelain
bushing, springs, and baseplate.

The simplest way to check igniter operation is by supplying voltage to the input and
checking to see whether an arc is produced. Check by either looking or listening to see if
there is an arc across the electrodes while the burner is running and the igniter is
energized.

The igniter must be grounded to the burner before checking the following. To check the
igniter, insure that the burner is off, and use an ohmmeter to check the resistance
between one of the springs and exposed metal on the burner (for example, a housing
bolt). The meter should read less than 2000 ohms when measuring the spring-to-ground
resistance at either spring.

The igniter should be replaced if the meter indicates an open circuit, the difference
between the two spring-to-ground resistance reading is greater then 20%, or the springto-spring resistance does not read approximately twice the spring-to-ground reading.

**Igniter** **base retaining clips**

**Igniter baseplate hinge**

**Picture 6 - Igniter hinge and retainer clips**

**E. Servicing nozzle line assembly**
Before proceeding, turn off power to the burner.
1. Disconnect the oil connector tube from the nozzle line.
2. Referring to Picture 7, loosen the two screws securing the igniter retaining clips and
rotate both clips to release the igniter baseplate. Then tilt the igniter back on its Hinge.
3. Remove the splined nut.
4. Remove the nozzle line assembly from the burner, being careful not to damage the
electrodes or insulators while handling. To ease removal of long assemblies (over 9
inches), rotate the assembly 180 degrees from the installed position after pulling
partially out of the tube.
5. To replace the nozzle line assembly, reverse the above steps.

**F. Check/adjust “Z” dimension**
Refer to Figure 8. The critical “Z” dimension is the distance from the face of the nozzle to
the flat face of the head. This distance for **F heads** is 1 1/8”. The “Z” dimension is factory
set but should always be verified during service and installation. If the “Z” dimension is
out of adjustment, perform the following steps.
Before proceeding, turn off power to the WC.

1. Disconnect the oil connector tube from the nozzle line.
2. Referring to Figure 6. Loosen the splined nut from the nozzle line. Loosen the hex
head screw securing the escutcheon plate to the burner housing.
3. Use a ruler to measure the distance from the nozzle head to the face of the head.

4. Slide the nozzle line forward or back until this dimension for F heads is 1 1/8”.
5. Tighten the hex and head screw to secure the plate to the burner chassis. Then
tighten the splined nut and attach the oil connector tube.
6. Recheck the “Z” dimension periodically when servicing to ensure the plate has not
shifted. You will need to reset the “Z” dimension if you replace the air tube or nozzle
line assembly.

**Figure 8 - Z Dimension layout**

**Drive component maintenance**
**A. Motor, blower wheel, and coupling replacement**

The motor will require replacement if the proper voltage is measure at the motor input,
and the motor will either not run, or the current draw with a free running pump exceeds
10% of the rated current.
To replace the burner motor, coupling and/or blower wheel perform the following steps.
1. Before servicing, turn off and/or disconnect all power to the burner.
2. Disconnect the burner motor wires.
3. Remove the bolts securing the motor to the burner housing.
4. Remove the motor, coupling, and blower wheel.
5. Loosen the set screw on the blower wheel to slide the existing wheel off the shaft.
6. Slide the new blower wheel onto the old shaft (after thoroughly cleaning housing)
and/or slide the old blower wheel onto the new motor shaft.
7. Place a 0.30” feeler gauge between the blower wheel and the motor housing.
8. Slide the blower wheel toward the motor until it contacts the feeler gauge.
9. Rotate the blower wheel until the setscrew is centered on the flat of the motor shaft.
Tighten the setscrew to secure the wheel.

**Flat on motor shaft**

**Insert feeler gauge between** **Access hole to set screw**

**B. Pump Maintenance**
This Equipment must be installed, adjusted and started only by a qualified service
technician - an individual or agency licensed and experienced with all codes and
ordinances, who is responsible for the installation and adjustment of the equipment. The
installation must comply with all local codes and ordinances and with the National Fire
Protection Association Standard for Liquid Fuel Equipment, NFPA 31 (or CSA B139).

General pump information
Important information - Long or oversized inlet lines may require the pump to operate dry
during initial bleeding period. In such cases, the priming may be assisted by injecting fuel
oil in the pump gear set. Under lift conditions, lines and fittings must be air tight. To
assure this, “Pipe Dope” may be applied to both the used and unused inlet and return
fittings.

**DO NOT USE TEFLON TAPE! DO NOT USE COMPRESSION FITTINGS!**

Vacuum check - A Vacuum Gage may be installed in either of the 1⁄4” NPT inlet ports.

Pressure check - When a pressure check is made use the nozzle port. If the bleed port is
used, the reading on the gauge should be approximately 5 psig higher than the pressure
reading on the nozzle port.

**C. Valve Coil and Stem Replacement**
To determine if the valve coil requires replacement, perform the following steps.
1. Remove the cord set from the valve

2. Place the leads from an ohmmeter across the coil

3. A 12 volt coil should measure between 15 and 25 ohms.
4. If the meter indicates an open circuit, replace the coil.

To check pump operation perform the following:
1. Check the operating pressure by removing the copper tubing from the nozzle line and
installing a pressure gauge in the line. With the motor running and the coil energized,
check the gauge. The pressure should read 100 psig unless otherwise stated.
2. To check the cutoff function, deadhead the pressure gauge onto the copper
connector tube attached to the nozzle port. Run the burner for a short period of time.
Shut the burner off; the pressure should drop and hold.

To replace the coil and/or valve stem assembly perform the following steps:
1. Before servicing, turn off and/or disconnect all power to the burner.
2. Use the shut-off valve between the fuel tank and the pump to block oil from the
burner.
3. Remove the copper Tube Assembly when replacing the pump or when removing the
coil and the tube blocks the coil.
4. Using a flat tip screwdriver, press the flat tip into the spring washer to prevent it from
rotating.
5. Using a 10mm wrench or adjustable wrench, remove the nut and spring washer.
6. Remove the coil by lifting it straight up.
7. Remove the two base plate screws, then the base plate by lifting straight up.
8. Remove valve stem assembly by pulling straight up.
9. To install the new stem and coil assemblies, follow the above steps in reverse order,
tightening each part as you go.
10. Restore power, start the burner and perform the combustion test described
previously in this manual.
