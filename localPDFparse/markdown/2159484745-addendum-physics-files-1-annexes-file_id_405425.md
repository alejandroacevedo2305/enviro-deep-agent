**814.41**

3 It does not regulate:

Protection of the Ecological Balance

a. protection against noise originating from an industrial site as long as this only affects industrial buildings and dwellings within the site;

b. protection against infra- and ultrasound.

4 ... 2

## Art. 2 Definitions

1 Stationary installations are buildings, transport facilities, building facilities and
other immobile equipment that generate exterior noise during operation. These
include in particular roads, railway installations, aerodromes, industrial, commercial
and agricultural installations, firing ranges and permanent military firing ranges and
training grounds.

2 New stationary installations also include stationary installations and buildings
whose use has been completely altered.

3 Emission limitation measures are technical, structural or functional modifications
to installations, or measures to redirect, restrict or calm the flow of traffic, or structural measures along the emission path. The purpose of the measures is to prevent or
reduce the generation or propagation of exterior noise.

4 Improvements are emission limitation measures for existing stationary installations.

5 Exposure limit values include impact thresholds, planning values and alarm values.
These are set according to the noise characteristics, the time of day and the sensitivity to noise of the buildings and areas to be protected.

6 Rooms sensitive to noise are:

a. rooms in dwellings with the exception of kitchens without dining facilities,
washrooms and storerooms;

b. rooms in industrial buildings that are regularly occupied by persons for sustained periods of time, with the exception of those for farm animals and
those with high levels of industrial noise.

# Chapter 2 Vehicles, Mobile Appliances and Machines

## Section 1 Emission Limitation Measures from Vehicles

### Art. 3

1 Noise emitted from motorised vehicles, aircraft, water craft and railways must be
reduced as far as possible by technical and operational means, and to the extent that
this is economically acceptable.

2 Repealed by No I of the O of 12 April 2000, with effect from 1 May 2000
(AS **2000** 1388).

Noise Abatement O

**814.41**

2 Emission limitation measures are governed by the legislation on road traffic, civil
aviation, inland navigation or the railways, provided the vehicle concerned is covered by one of these categories of legislation.

3 Emission limitation measures for other vehicles is governed by the provisions on
mobile appliances and machines.

## Section 2

**Emission Limitation Measures for Mobile Appliances and Machines**

### Art. 4 Principles

1 The emissions of exterior noise from mobile appliances and machines must be
reduced to the extent that:

a. this is technically and operationally feasible and economically acceptable;
and that

b. the well-being of the affected population is not seriously impaired.

2 The enforcement authorities shall order operational and structural measures, or
those for proper maintenance.

3 Where it is not possible to avoid exposure to highly disturbing noise due to the
operation of military equipment, machines and weapons, the enforcement authorities
shall relax the requirements.

4 The emissions of appliances and machines that are used to operate a stationary
installation are limited according to the provisions on stationary installations.

### Art. 5 [3] Conformity assessment and marking of equipment and machines

1 Equipment and machines may be placed on the market only following a conformity
assessment and the appropriate marking.

2 The Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC) shall specify: [4]

a. the types of equipment and machines subject to the conformity assessment
and marking;

b. the requirements for preventive emission limitation measures and marking,
taking into account internationally recognised standards;

c. the documents to be submitted for the purpose of the conformity assessment;

d. the test, measurement and calculation procedures;

e. the subsequent controls;

f. the recognition of foreign test results and labelling.

### Art. 6 Regulations on noise from building sites

The Federal Office for the Environment [5] shall issue regulations covering structural
and operational measures to control noise from building sites.

# Chapter 3 New and Modified Stationary Installations

## Art. 7 Emission limitation measures for new stationary installations

1 Noise emissions from new stationary installations shall be limited as directed by
the enforcement authorities insofar as:

a. this is technically and operationally feasible and economically acceptable;
and

b. the noise exposure level resulting from the installation alone does not exceed
the planning values.

2 The enforcement authorities shall relax the requirements in cases where compliance with the planning values would place a disproportionate burden on the installation and there is an overriding public interest, particularly regarding questions of
spatial planning. The impact thresholds must not, however, be exceeded. [6]

## Art. 8 Emission limitation measures for modified stationary installations

1 Where a stationary installation that already exists when this Ordinance comes into
force is modified, the noise emissions from the new or modified parts of the installation must be limited as directed by the enforcement authorities as far as this is technically and operationally feasible and economically acceptable. [7]

2 If the installation is significantly modified, the noise emissions from the installation as a whole must be limited at least to the extent that the impact thresholds are
not exceeded.

3 Conversions, extensions and operational changes carried out by the person responsible for the installation constitute significant modifications to stationary installations if it is anticipated that the noise exposure level will rise perceptibly as a result
either of the installation itself or of the increased demand on existing transport
facilities. The rebuilding of an installation constitutes a significant modification
irrespective of the circumstances.

4 If a new stationary installation is modified, Article 7 applies. 8

5 The name of the administrative unit has been changed in application of Art. 16 para. 3 of
the Publication Ordinance of 17 Nov. 2004 (AS **2004** 4937). This change has been made
throughout the text.

Noise Abatement O

## Art. 9 Increased demand on transport facilities

**814.41**

The operation of new or significantly modified stationary installations must not lead
to a situation in which:

a. owing to the increased demand made on a transport facility, the impact
thresholds are exceeded; or

b. owing to the increased demand made on a transport facility in need of remediation, the noise exposure level rises perceptibly.

## Art. 10 Soundproofing measures in existing buildings

1 If the requirements specified in Articles 7 paragraph 2 and 8 paragraph 2 or in
Article 9 are not fulfilled by new or significantly modified public or licensed stationary installations, the enforcement authorities shall require the owners of existing
buildings exposed to noise to soundproof the windows of rooms sensitive to noise in
accordance with Annex 1.

2 With the approval of the enforcement authorities, building owners may carry out
other structural soundproofing measures provided these reduce the noise within the
rooms to the same extent.

3 Soundproofing measures need not be taken if:

a. no perceptible reduction of the noise level in the building is to be expected;

b. they conflict with the overriding interest of preserving local character or
monuments;

c. the building is due to be demolished within three years of putting the new or
modified installation into service, or the rooms concerned will be converted
to purposes not sensitive to noise within this period.

## Art. 11 Costs

1 The person responsible for the new or significantly modified installation bears the
costs of limiting the emission it causes.

2 If the building owner is required to take soundproofing measures according to
Article 10 paragraph 1, the person responsible for the installation also bears the
customary local costs proven to be due for:

a. engineering and supervision of works;

b. soundproofing of the windows in accordance with Annex 1 and the resulting
necessary adaptations;

c. the financing if the person responsible has failed to contribute despite being
requested to do so by the building owner;

d. any fees due.

3 If the building owner is required to take soundproofing measures according to
Article 10 paragraph 2, the person responsible for the installation bears the custom

5

**814.41**

Protection of the Ecological Balance

ary local costs proven to be due insofar as these do not exceed those under paragraph
2. The building owner bears the remaining costs.

4 Where the need for emission limitation measures or soundproofing measures arises
as a result of noise from several installations, the costs are divided among the installations in proportion to their contribution to the noise exposure level.

5 The building owner bears the costs for maintenance and renewal of the soundproofing measures.

## Art. 12 Inspection

The enforcement authorities shall inspect the new or modified installation within one
year of its being put into service to check whether the emission limitation and
soundproofing measures ordered have been taken. In the event of any doubt, they
carry out tests to assess the effectiveness of the measures.

# Chapter 4 Existing Stationary Installations

## Section 1 Improvements and Soundproofing Measures

### Art. 13 Improvements

1 In the case of stationary installations that contribute significantly to the impact
thresholds being exceeded, the enforcement authorities shall order the necessary
improvement measures, after hearing the persons responsible for the installations.

2 The installations shall be improved to the extent that:

a. is technically and operationally feasible and economically acceptable; and

b. the impact thresholds are no longer exceeded.

3 Unless there are overriding interests, the enforcement authorities give priority to
measures which prevent or reduce noise generation in preference to those which
simply prevent or reduce noise propagation.

4 Improvements need not be carried out if:

a. the impact thresholds are exceeded only in building zones that have not yet
been developed;

b. due to the cantonal building and planning legislation, planning, design or
structural measures taken at the site exposed to the noise will satisfy the impact thresholds before the time limit specified in Article 17.

### Art. 14 Relaxation of the requirements for improvements

1 The enforcement authorities shall relax the requirements in cases where:

a. improvements would result in unreasonable operational limitations or costs;

6

Noise Abatement O

**814.41**

b. overriding interests, namely those of the preservation of local character, nature and landscape protection, traffic and operational safety, or national security, conflict with the improvement objective.

2 Unlicensed private installations must not, however, exceed the alarm values.

### Art. 15 Soundproofing measures for existing buildings

1 If, as a result of relaxing the requirements, the alarm values for public or licensed
stationary installations cannot be complied with, the enforcement authorities shall
require the owners of existing buildings exposed to noise to soundproof the windows
of rooms sensitive to noise in accordance with Annex 1.

2 With the approval of the enforcement authorities, building owners may take other
soundproofing measures in the building provided these reduce the noise within the
rooms to the same extent.

3 Soundproofing measures need not be taken if:

a. no perceptible reduction of noise in the building is to be expected;

b. they conflict with the overriding interest of preserving local character or
monuments;

c. the building is due to be demolished within three years of the soundproofing
measures being ordered, or the rooms will be converted to purposes not sensitive to noise within this period.

### Art. 16 Costs

1 The person responsible for the installation bears the costs of its improvement.

2 The person responsible for a public or licensed installation also bears the costs of
soundproofing measures for existing buildings under Article 11, unless an exemption has been granted under Article 20 paragraph 2 of the Act.

3 Where improvements or soundproofing measures are required as a result of noise
from several installations, the costs are divided among the installations in proportion
to their contribution to the noise exposure level.

4 The building owner bears the costs of maintenance and renewal of the soundproofing measures.

### Art. 17 Time limits

1 The enforcement authorities set the time limits for implementing improvements
and soundproofing measures according to their urgency.

2 In assessing urgency, the following factors are decisive:

a. the extent to which the impact thresholds are exceeded;

b. the number of persons affected by the noise;

c. the cost-benefit relationship.

# Chapter 6 Soundproofing of New Buildings

## Art. 32 Requirements

1 The project owner of a new building shall ensure that the soundproofing of the
external building elements and partitions of rooms sensitive to noise, and of the
stairs and building facilities complies with recognised codes of building practice.
These are in particular, for noise from civil aerodromes that are used by heavy
aircraft, the stricter requirements, and for noise from other stationary installations,
the minimum requirements, of SIA Standard No 181 of the Swiss Society of Engineers and Architects. [28]

2 If the impact thresholds are exceeded but the requirements of Article 31 paragraph
2 for granting planning permission are fulfilled, the enforcement authorities shall
impose stricter requirements for the soundproofing of the external building elements
appropriately.

3 The requirements also apply to the external building elements, partitions, stairways
and building facilities that are converted, replaced or newly installed. On request, the
enforcement authorities grant relief if compliance with the requirements would
involve unreasonable cost.

## Art. 33 External building elements, partitions and building facilities

1 External building elements form the external boundary of a room (e.g. windows,
external doors, external walls, roofs).

2 Partitions (e.g. internal walls, ceilings, doors) serve to separate individual units,
such as dwellings, within the building.

3 Building facilities are fixed installations such as heating, ventilation, supply and
disposal systems, lifts and washing machines.

## Art. 34 Application for planning permission

1 The project owner must specify in the application:

a. the exterior noise pollution in the event that the impact thresholds are exceeded;

b. the use to which the rooms are put;

Protection of the Ecological Balance

c. the external building elements and partitions of rooms sensitive to noise.

2 For building projects in areas in which the impact thresholds are exceeded, the
enforcement authorities may demand details of the soundproofing of the external
building elements.

## Art. 35 Inspections

After building works are completed, the enforcement authorities shall make random
checks to verify whether the soundproofing measures comply with the requirements.
In the event of any doubt, they must carry out a more detailed inspection.

**due to Stationary Installations** **[29]**

## Section 1 Investigation

### Art. 36 [30] Obligation to investigate

1 The enforcement authorities shall investigate the exposure to exterior noise due to
stationary installations, or order its investigation if they have grounds to believe that
the relevant exposure limit values are being exceeded or that this is to be expected.

2 They shall take account of increases and reductions in noise exposure levels that
are to be expected due to:

a. the construction, alteration or improvement of stationary installations, in particular if the projects in question have already been approved or made available for public inspection at the time of the investigation; and

b. the construction, alteration or demolition of other structures if the projects
have been made available for public inspection at the time of the investigation.

### 3 Determination of the Rating Sound Level

#### 31 Principles

### 1 The rating sound level Lr for road traffic noise is determined from the partial rating

sound levels for motor vehicle noise (Lr1) and railway noise (Lr2) as follows:

Lr = 10 x log (10 [0,1 x Lr1 ] + 10 [0,1 x Lr2 ] )

### 2 The partial rating sound level Lr1 is the sum of the equivalent continuous

A-weighted sound level Leq,m resulting from motor vehicles, and the level correction K1:

Lr1 = Leq,m + K1

### 3 The partial rating sound level Lr2 is the sum of the equivalent continuous

A-weighted sound level Leq,b resulting from the railways, and the level correction
K2:

Lr2 = Leq,b + K2

4 The partial rating sound levels Lr1 and Lr2 are determined for average day and
night traffic flows assuming a dry road surface.

23

**814.41**

#### 32 Average Day and Night Traffic

Protection of the Ecological Balance

1 The average day and night traffic is defined as the annual average of the hourly
traffic between 06 and 22 hours and between 22 and 06 hours.

2 The hourly motor vehicle traffic during the day (Nt) and at night (Nn) are each
divided into two partial traffic flows, Nt1 and Nt2, and Nn1 and Nn2, respectively.

#### 3 The partial traffic flows Nt1 and Nn1 for motor vehicle traffic include private cars,

delivery vehicles, minibuses, motorcycles and trolley buses.

4 The partial traffic flows Nt2 and Nn2 for motor vehicle traffic comprise lorries,
articulated lorries, coaches, motorcycles and tractors.

5 Railway traffic comprises all scheduled and non-scheduled trains, including service
journeys.

#### 33 Determination of Average Day and Night Motor Vehicle Traffic

1 The average day and night traffic (Nt, Nn) and the partial traffic flows (Nt1, Nt2,
Nn1, Nn2) are determined:

a. from traffic surveys for existing roads;

b. from forecasts of traffic volume for roads which are to be built or modified.

2 Where insufficient data is available from traffic surveys, or no detailed forecasts
exist, the traffic flows Nt, Nn, Nt1, Nt2, Nn1 and Nn2 are calculated from the average daily traffic (ADT; vehicles per 24 h) as follows:

Nt = 0.058  ADT Nn = 0.009  ADT

Nt1 = 0.90  Nt Nn1 = 0.95  Nn

Nt2 = 0.10  Nt Nn2 = 0.05  Nn

#### 3 The ADT is determined according to the recognised principles of traffic planning

and traffic technology.

#### 34 Determination of the Average Day and Night Traffic

**for Railways**

The average day and night traffic for railways is determined:

a. from the timetable and traffic data for existing railway installations;

b. from traffic volume forecasts for railway installations which are to be built
or modified.

#### 35 Level Corrections

**814.41**

1 The level correction K1 for motor vehicle noise is calculated as follows from the
average day and night traffic:

K1 = -5 for N < 31.6
K1 = 10  log(N/100) for 31.6 ≤ N ≤ 100
K1 = 0 for N > 100

Here, N stands for the hourly motor vehicle traffic Nt or Nn.

2 The K2 level correction for railway noise is equal to -5. For screeching railway
noise that occurs frequently and is clearly audible, the K2 level correction is equal
to 0.

### 2 The partial rating sound level Lr1 is the sum of the equivalent continuous

A-weighted sound level Leq,f resulting from vehicle operation, and the level correction K1:

Lr1 = Leq,f + K1

#### 32 Average Day and Night Operations

1 Average day and night operations are hauling and shunting operations from 06 to
22 hours and from 22 to 06 hours respectively, averaged over the year.

2 Vehicle operations comprise all scheduled and non-scheduled trains, including
service journeys.

#### 3 Shunting comprises all shunting movements and operations intended for the pur
pose of connecting and disconnecting trains.

4 Vehicle operations and shunting are determined:

a. from the timetable and operating data for existing railway installations;

b. from operational forecasts for railway installations which are to be built or

modified.

#### 33 Level Corrections

1 The level correction K1 for transport noise is calculated as follows:

K1 = -15 for N < 7.9
K1 = 10  log (N/250) for 7.9 ≤ N ≤ 79
K1 =  5 for N > 79

Here, N stands for the number of train journeys per day or night.

### 3 Determination of the Rating Sound Level Lr k for Light

**Aircraft Noise**

#### 31 Principles

1 The rating sound level Lr k for light aircraft noise is the sum of the equivalent
continuous A-weighted sound level Leq k and the level correction K:

Lr k = Leq k + K

2 The equivalent continuous sound level Leq k is determined for the average number
of hourly aircraft movements (number of movements n) for a day with average peak
operations.

### 3 Aircraft movements are all landings and takeoffs of light aircraft. Go-arounds

count as two flight movements.

#### 32 Number of Aircraft Movements n for existing Civil Aerodromes

For existing civil aerodromes, the number of aircraft movements n is determined as
follows:

a. the six months with the greatest amount of traffic during the operating year
are identified;

b. for these six months, the average daily number of flight movements is determined separately for each of the seven days of the week. The average daily values for the two days of the week with the most traffic are designated as
N1 and N2;

c. n is determined by averaging N1 and N2 over the twelve daytime hours as
follows:

n = (N1 + N2)/24

#### 33 Number of Aircraft Movements n for new Civil Aerodromes

1 For civil aerodromes which are to be built or modified, the number of flight
movements n is determined from forecasts of traffic volume.

2 If no detailed forecasts can be made, n is calculated from the forecasted annual
number of aircraft movements N as follows:

n = (N x 2,4)/(365 x 12)

30

Noise Abatement O

#### 34 Level Corrections

**814.41**

The level correction K is calculated from the annual number of aircraft movements

N as follows:

K = 0 for N < 15 000

K = 10 x log (N/15 000) for N ≥ 15 000

### 4 Determination of the Rating Sound Level Lr for Traffic at Civil

**Aerodromes used by Heavy Aircraft**

#### 41 Principles

1 At civil aerodromes used by heavy aircraft, the rating sound level Lr of total traffic
is determined based on the relevant aircraft traffic, whereby separate calculations are
made for daytime (06-22 hours), and for the first (22-23 hours), second (23-24
hours) and last (05-06 hours) night hours.

2 At civil aerodromes used by heavy aircraft, the daytime rating sound level for total
traffic Lr t is calculated from the rating sound levels for light aircraft Lr k and heavy
aircraft Lr g as follows:

Lr t = 10 x log (10 [0,1 x ] _[Lr]_ _k_ + 10 [0,1 x ] _[Lr]_ _g_ )

#### 3 For heavy aircraft noise, the daytime rating sound level is the sum of the equivalent

continuous A-weighted sound level Leq g arising from aircraft operations between 06
and 22 hours, averaged over one year:

Lr g = Leq g

### 4 For heavy aircraft noise, the rating sound level Lr n for the first, the second and the

last night hour is the equivalent continuous A-weighted sound level Leq n, each
averaged over one hour, arising from aircraft operations during the periods 22-23,
23-24 hours and 05-06 hours, averaged over one year:

Lr n = Leq n

#### 42 Relevant Aircraft Traffic

1 The equivalent continuous sound levels Leq g and Leq n are determined from the
operational data.

2 For civil aerodromes that are to be built or modified, the relevant aircraft traffic is
determined from forecasts of traffic volume.

#### 3 Flights taking place after the second night hour (23-24 hours) and before the last

night hour (05-06) are assigned to the second night hour (23-24 hours).

### 3 Determination of the Rating Sound Level

#### 31 Principles

### 1 The rating sound level Lr for industrial, commercial and similar types of noise is

determined from the partial rating sound levels Lr,i for each noise phase as follows,
whereby separate calculations are made for daytime (07 to 19 hours) and night-time
(19 to 07 hours):

Lr = 10  log  10 0,1  Lr,i
i

### 2 The partial rating sound level Lr,i is determined for the average daily duration of

the noise phase i as follows:

Lr,i = Leq,i + K1,i + K2,i + K3,i + 10 x log (ti/to)

33

**814.41**

_where:_

Protection of the Ecological Balance

Leq,i is the equivalent continuous A-weighted sound level during the noise phase
i;
K1,i is the level correction for the noise phase i;
K2,i is the level correction for the noise phase i;
K3,i is the level correction for the noise phase i;
ti is the average daily duration of the noise phase i in minutes;
to = 720 minutes.

#### 3 Noise phases are time periods in which the exposure point is subject to uniform

noise with respect to sound level, frequency and pulse content.

#### 32 Average Daily Duration of Noise Phases

1 The average daily duration (ti) of the noise phase i is calculated from its annual
duration (Ti) and the annual number of working days (B) as follows:

ti = Ti/B

2 For new or modified installations, the average daily duration of the noise phase i is
determined from operational forecasts.

#### 33 Level Corrections

b. for noise according to Number 1 paragraph 1 letter c 0

c. for noise according to with Number 1 paragraph 1 letter d 0 by day
5 at night

d. for noise according to Number 1 paragraph 1 letter e 5 by day

### 3 Determination of rating sound level

#### 31 Principles

1 The rating sound level Lr for the noise from firing range installations is the energetic sum of the partial rating sound level Lri for the weapons categories:



_Lr_  10  log 10 1.0  _Lri_



 

_i_

2 The partial rating sound level Lri is the sum of the average single shot sound level
Li of a weapons category and the level correction Ki:

Lri = Li + Ki

### 3 The average single shot sound level Li is the energetic average weighted according

to the number of shots of the energetically averaged single shot sound level Lj of a
type of weapon or type of ammunition:

_Mj_ 1.0  _Lj_

_Li_  10  log _Mj_  10 1.0 
 _Mi_
_j_

10  log  10 1.0 

4 The energetically averaged single shot sound level Lj must be determined using the
measurements of the A-weighted maximum sound level with the FAST time constants.

_Where:_

Mj is the number of shots fired annually using a single type of weapon or a
single type of ammunition of a weapons category, averaged over three years;

Mi is the number of shots fired annually using weapons of a single category,
averaged over three years.

#### 32 Level Correction

##### 321 Calculation

1 The level correction Ki is calculated as follows:

Ki = 10 x log (Dwi + 3 x Dsi) + 3 x log Mi - 44

_Where:_

Dwi is the number of annual firing half-days falling on a weekday, averaged over
three years, for each weapons category;

Dsi is the number of annual firing half-days falling on a Sunday or a general
public holiday, averaged over three years, for each weapons category.

37

**814.41**

Protection of the Ecological Balance

2 When determining the number of firing half-days and the number of shots, all
exercises that take place regularly over a period of three years must be taken into
account.

##### 322 Determination of the number of firing half-days

1 Any firing exercise taking place in the morning or in the afternoon and lasting
more than two hours counts as a firing half-day. Exercises lasting two hours or less
count as half a firing half-day.

2 For new or modified firing range installations, the number of firing half-days is
determined on the basis of operational forecasts. For existing firing range installations, the number of firing half-days is determined by counting.

##### 323 Determination of the number of shots

1 For existing firing range installations, the number of shots Mi per weapons category is determined from the operational logs.

2 If the operational logs of existing firing range installations are incomplete or if the
firing range installations are new or have been modified, the number of shots M is
determined from forecasts of future use.

### 3 Determination of the Rating Sound Level

#### 31 Principles

1 The rating sound level Lr for noise from military aerodromes is calculated from the
rating sound levels Lr m for military aircraft noise and Lr z for civil aircraft noise, as
follows:

_Lr_ = 10 × log (10 [0,1×] _[Lr]_ _[m]_ + 10 [0,1×] _[Lr]_ _[z]_ )

2 The rating sound level Lr z is determined in the same way as the corresponding Lr
for civil aerodromes specified in Annex 5 Numbers 3 and 4.

### 3 The rating sound level Lr m is determined from the partial rating sound levels Lr j,

for noise from jet aircraft, and Lr p, for noise from propeller aircraft, as follows:

_Lr_ _m_ = 10 × log (10 [0,1×] _[Lr]_ _[j]_ + 10 [0,1×] _[Lr]_ _[p]_ )

4 The partial rating sound level Lr j is the sum of the equivalent continuous Aweighted sound level Leq j arising from the operation of jet aircraft, and the level
corrections K 0 and K 1 :

Lr j = Leq j + K 0 + K 1

5
The partial rating sound level Lr p is the sum of the equivalent continuous Aweighted sound level Leq p arising from the operation of propeller aircraft, and the
level corrections K 0 and K 2 :

Lr p = Leq p + K 0 + K 2

6 The equivalent continuous sound levels Leq j and Leq p are calculated for the average number of hourly flight movements for a day with an average level of traffic,
whereby flight movements of jet aircraft and propeller aircraft are counted separately (number of flight movements n j and n p ).

7 Flight movements are all takeoffs and landings of jet and propeller aircraft. Goarounds count as two flight movements.

#### 32 Numbers of Flight Movements n j and n p for Military

**Aerodromes**

1 For existing military aerodromes, the number of flight movements n j and n p are
determined as follows:

a. the six months of the operating year with the greatest amount of traffic are
identified, whereby flight movements of jet aircraft and propeller aircraft are
counted separately;

b. for these six months, the number of flight movements of jet aircraft M j and
propeller aircraft M p are determined;

40

Noise Abatement O

**814.41**

c. the numbers of flight movements n j and n p are calculated from M j and M p by
averaging them over 130 days and twelve daytime hours:

n j = M j /(12 x 130)
n p = M p /(12 x 130)

2 For military aerodromes that are to be built or modified, the numbers of flight
movements n j and n p are determined from forecasts of traffic volume.

#### 33 Level Corrections

1 The level correction K 0 is equal to -8.

2 The level correction K 1 is calculated from the annual number of flight movements
of jet aircraft N j as follows:

K 1 = 0 for N j < 15 000

K 1 = 10 x log (N j /15 000) for N j ≥ 15 000

#### 3 The level correction K 2 is calculated from the annual number of flight movements

of propeller aircraft N p as follows:

K 2 = 0 for N p < 15 000

K 2 = 10 x log (N p /15 000) for N p ≥ 15 000
