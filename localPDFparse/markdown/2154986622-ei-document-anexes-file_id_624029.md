SIMPLIFY YOUR COMMISSIONING

WITH THE MOST COMPETITIVE

SOLUTION INTEGRATED WITH ALL

THE MEDIUM VOLTAGE EQUIPMENT

The MV Skid is a compact turnkey outdoor platform made

from high resistance galvanized steel with all the medium

voltage equipment integrated, including an outdoor power

power connection to any HEMK solar inverter. With between

600 V - 690 V in the low voltage range and 12 kV to 36 kV in

the high voltage range, this compact platform achieves power

outputs between 2125 kVA and 3800 kVA.

This compact solution also allows the installation of a low

needs as well as different types of cells and even an enclo

project design of the PV plant, reducing installation costs and

and the fact that it is also easier to transport and deliver into

remote sites makes it the optimal solution for EPC`s (engi

neering, procurement and construction).

THE MOST POWER DENSE

TURN-KEY STATION FOR

LARGE SCALE PV PLANTS

The Twin Skid has been designed to meet the requirements

of large scale PV power plants. The station is a compact

outdoor skid made of high resistance galvanized steel with all

the medium voltage equipment integrated and acco panied

by a inverter: protection cell, outdoor power transformer, oil

between 4250 kVA and 7600 kVA.

reducing the cost of installation and the amount of resources

needed thanks to its extra high power density.
