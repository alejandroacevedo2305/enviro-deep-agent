~~**INTRODUCTION**~~

Your new Vibratory Plate Compactor will
more than satisfy your expectations. It
has been manufactured under stringent
quality standards to meet superior performance
criteria. You will find it easy and safe to operate,
and with proper care, it will give you many years of
dependable service.

**Carefully read through this entire operator’s**
**manual before using your new Log Splitter.**
**Take special care to heed the cautions and**
**warnings**

The commitment to quality has been designed into
details: reinforced self-cleaning base plate, engine
oil drain hose, closed V-belt guard, self-adjusting
centrifugal clutch and folding handle. A range
of useful accessories enables use in all kinds of

applications.

The Plate Compactor applies energy to the loose
soil or other materials to increase its density
and load bearing capacity, mainly used for small
repair and maintenance work. The loose soil or
particles are moved or rearranged in a particular
manner close to each other to avoid any trapped
air or voids. It increases the load bearing capacity,
decreases water seepage, prevents soil settlement,
reduces swelling, contraction of the soil and
prevents frost damage. It is ideal for compaction
of granular soils, sands, gravel, crushed aggregate
and mixed soils.

**SAFETY**
**General Safety Rules**

**Understand your Machine**

Read and understand the operator’s manual
and labels affixed to the machine. Learn its

application and limitations as well as the specific
potential hazards peculiar to it. Be thoroughly
familiar with the controls and their proper
operation. Know how to stop the machine and
disengage the controls quickly. Make sure to read
and understand all the instructions and safety
precautions as outlined in the Engine Manual,
packed separately with your unit. Do not attempt to
operate the machine until you fully understand how
to properly operate and maintain the Engine and
how to avoid accidental injuries and/or property
damage.

**Work area**

Never start or run the engine inside a closed
area. The exhaust fumes are dangerous,
containing carbon monoxide, an odorless and
deadly gas. Operate this unit only in a well
ventilated outdoor area.

Never operate the machine without good
visibility or light.

**Personal safety**

Do not operate the machine while under the
influence of drugs, alcohol, or any medication
that could affect your ability to use it properly.
Dress properly. Wear heavy long pants, boots and
gloves. Do not wear loose clothing, short pants,
jewelry of any kind. Secure long hair so it is above
shoulder level. Keep your hair, clothing and gloves
away from moving parts. Loose clothes, jewelry or
long hair can be caught in moving parts.

Check your machine before starting it. Keep
guards in place and in working order. Make
sure all nuts, bolts, etc. are securely tightened.

G

B

Never operate the machine when it is in need
of repair or is in poor mechanical condition.
Replace damaged, missing or failed parts
before using it. Check for fuel leaks. Keep the
machine in safe working condition Do not use the
machine if the engine’s switch does not turn it on
or off. Any gasoline powered machine that can not
be controlled with the engine switch is dangerous
and must be replaced.

Form a habit of checking to see that keys
and adjusting wrenches are removed from
machine area before starting it. A wrench or
a key that is left attached to a rotating part of
the machine may result in personal injury.

Stay alert, watch what you are doing and use
common sense when operating the machine.

Do not overreach. Do not operate the machine
while barefoot or when wearing sandals or
similar lightweight footwear. Wear protective
footwear that will protect your feet and
improve your footing on slippery surfaces.

Keep proper footing and balance at all times.
This enables better control of the machine in

unexpected situations.

Avoid accidental starting. Be sure the engine’s
switch is off before transporting the machine
or performing any maintenance or service on the
unit. Transporting or performing maintenance or
service on a machine with its switch on invites

accidents.

**Fuel safety**

Fuel is highly flammable, and its vapors can
explode if ignited. Take precautions when using
to reduce the chance of serious personal injury.
When refilling or draining the fuel tank, use an
approved fuel storage container while in a clean,
well-ventilated outdoor area. Do not smoke,
or allow sparks, open flames or other sources
of ignition near the area while adding fuel or
operating the unit. Never fill fuel tank indoors.

5

Keep grounded conductive objects, such as tools,
away from exposed, live electrical parts and
connections to avoid sparking or arcing. These
events could ignite fumes or vapors. Always stop
the engine and allow it to cool before filling the fuel
tank. Never remove the cap of the fuel tank or add
fuel while the engine is running or when the engine
is hot. Do not operate the machine with known
leaks in the fuel system.

Loose the fuel tank cap slowly to relieve any
pressure in the tank.

Never overfill fuel tank (there should be no
fuel above the upper limit mark).

Replace all fuel tank and container caps
securely and wipe up spilled fuel. Never
operate the unit without the fuel cap securely
in place.

Replace all fuel tank and container caps
securely and wipe up spilled fuel. Never
operate the unit without the fuel cap securely
in place.

Avoid creating a source of ignition for spilled
fuel. If fuel is spilled, do not attempt to start
the engine but move the machine away
from the area of spillage and avoid creating
any source of ignition until fuel vapors have
dissipated.

Store fuel in containers specifically designed
and approved for this purpose.

Store fuel in a cool, well-ventilated area,
safely away from sparks, open flames or other
sources of ignition.

Never store fuel or machine with fuel in the

tank inside a building where fumes may reach
an spark, open flame, or any other source
of ignition, such as a water heater, furnace,
clothes dryer and the like. Allow the engine to
cool before storing in any enclosure.

**Machine use and care**

Never pick up or carry a machine while the
engine is running.

Do not force the machine. Use the correct

machine for your application. The correct
machine will do the job better and safer at the
rate for which it was designed.

Do not change the engine governor settings
or over-speed the engine. The governor controls
the maximum safe operating speed of the engine.

Do not run the engine at a high speed when
you are not pounding.

Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts.

Avoid contact with hot fuel, oil, exhaust fumes
and hot surfaces. Do not touch the engine or
muffler. These parts get extremely hot from
operation. They remain hot for a short time
after you turn off the unit. Allow the engine
to cool before doing maintenance or making
adjustments.

If the machine should start to make an unusual GB

noise or vibration, immediately shut off the
engine, disconnect the spark plug wire, and
check for the cause. Unusual noise or vibration

is generally warning of trouble.

Use only attachments and accessories
approved by the manufacturer. Failure to do
so can result in personal injury.

Maintain the machine. Check for misalignment
or binding of moving parts, breakage of parts
and any other condition that may affect the
machine’s operation. If damaged, have the
machine repaired before use. Many accidents
are caused by poorly maintained equipment.

Keep the engine and muffler free of grass,
leaves, excessive grease or carbon build up to
reduce the chance of a fire hazard.

Never douse or squirt the unit with water or
any other liquid. Keep handles dry, clean and
free from debris. Clean after each use.

Observe proper disposal laws and regulations
for gas, oil, etc. to protect the environment.

Store idle machine out of the reach of children
and do not allow persons unfamiliar with
the machine or these instructions to operate
it. Machine is dangerous in the hands of
untrained users.

**Service**

Before cleaning, repair, inspecting, or
adjusting, shut off the engine and make
certain all moving parts have stopped. Always
make sure the engine’s switch is in its “OFF”
position. Disconnect the spark plug wire, and
keep the wire away from the plug to prevent
accidental starting.

Have your machine serviced by a qualified
repair personnel using only identical
replacement parts. This will ensure that the
safety of the machine maintained.

~~**Specific Safety Rules**~~

To avoid injury, keep hands, fingers and feet
away from the base plate. Grip the handle of
the plate compactor firmly with both hands.
If both hands are holding the handle and your
feet are clear of the compactor base, your
hands, fingers and feet can not be injured by
the compactor base.

Always operate the machine from behind, never
pass or stand in front of the machine when the
engine is running.

Never place tools or any other item under the
plate compactor.

If the unit strikes a foreign object, stop the

6

G

B

engine, disconnect the spark plug, thoroughly
inspect the machine for any damage, and
repair the damage before restarting and
operating the machine.

Do not overload the machine capacity by
compacting too deep in a single pass or at too
fast a rate.

Never operate the unit at high transport
speeds on hard or slippery surfaces.

Exercise extreme caution when operating on
or crossing gravel drives, walks, or roads. Stay
alert for hidden hazards or traffic. Do not carry

passengers.

Never leave the operating position and leave the
plate compactor unattended when the engine is
running.

Always stop the engine when compacting is
delayed or when walking from one location to
another.

Stay away from the edged of ditches and avoid
actions that may cause the plate compactor to
topple over.

Always ascend slopes carefully, in a direct path
and in reverse to present the plate compactor from
toppling over onto the operator.

Always park the unit on a firm and level surface
and shut the tool off.

To reduce exposure to vibration, limit the
hours of operation and take periodic breaks
to minimize repetition and rest your hand.
Reduce the speed and force in which you do
the repetitive movement. Try to fill each day
with jobs where operating hand-held power
equipment is not required.

~~**KNOW YOUR MACHINE**~~

**Features and Controls**

**Fuel Valve Control**

The fuel valve opens and closes the passage
between the fuel tank and the carburetor. The
fuel valve lever must be in the ON position
for the engine to run. When the engine is not
in use, leave the fuel valve lever in the OFF
position to prevent carburetor flooding and to
reduce the possibility of fuel leakage.

**Throttle Control**

The throttle lever controls engine speed.
Moving the throttle lever makes the engine
run faster or slower.

**Engine Switch**

The engine switch enables and disables the
ignition system. The engine switch must be in
the ON position for the engine to run. Turning
the engine switch to the OFF position stops
the engine.

**Choke Lever**

The choke lever opens and closes the choke
valve in the carburetor. The closed position
enriches the fuel mixture for starting a cold
engine. The open position provides the correct
fuel mixture for operation after starting, and
for restarting a warm engine. Some engine
applications use a remotely-mounted choke
control rather than the engine-mounted choke
lever.

**Recoil Starter Grip**

Pulling the starter grip operates the recoil
starter to crank the engine.

**Oil Drain Hose**

Running the engine with dirty oil can cause
premature engine wear and failure. Changing
oil regularly is extremely important. The
flexible oil drain hose is equipped to drain oil
into appropriate receptacle.

**Choke Lever**

Running the engine with dirty oil can cause
premature engine wear and failure. Changing
oil regularly is extremely important. The
flexible oil drain hose is equipped to drain oil
into appropriate receptacle.

**Exciter**

An eccentric weight mounted on the exciter
shaft contained within exciter housing is
driven at high speed by a clutch and belt
drive system. This high speed shaft revolution
causes the rapid lifting and downward
ramming motion of the machine as well as
imparting a forward motion.

~~**Compactor Operation**~~

**Adding fuel**

Fill the fuel tank as instructed in the separate
Engine Manual packed with the Plate Compactor.

11

G

B

More detailed description of the engine operation
and all related precautions and procedures can be
found in the Engine Manual packed separately with
the unit.

**Starting Engine**

1. Move the fuel valve lever to the ON

position.
2. To start a cold engine, move the choke to
the CLOSE position.
To restart a warm engine, leave the choke
lever in the OPEN position.
3. Move the throttle lever away from the
SLOW position, about 1/3 of the way
toward the FAST position.
4. Turn the engine switch to the ON position.
5. Operate the starter

**Operating**

**Do not operate plate on concrete or on**
**extremely hard, dry, compacted surfaces.**
**The plate will jump rather than vibrate and**
**could damage both plate and engine.**

1. After engine warms up, pull throttle lever
to accelerate engine speed. Plate will begin
vibrating and move forward.

2. The plate compactor is designed to
run at an engine speed (engine take off
shaft) of 3600 rpm (Normally considered
full throttle). Running the engine at
lower rpm’s will result in a decrease of
compaction force and lower travel speed.
It will create excessive “out-of-synch”
vibrations resulting in poor compaction,
maneuverability, excessive wear to the
machine, and discomfort to the operator.

3. In operation, guide the machine, but let GB
the compactor do the work. Bearing down
on the handle is unnecessary and causes
shock absorber wear.

4. On level surfaces the compactor moves forward

rapidly. On uneven surfaces or inclines, light
forward pressure on handle may be required to
assist the compactor in moving forward.

5. The number of passes required to reach
a desired compaction level will depend
on the type and moisture content of soil. Maximum
soil compaction has been reached when excessive
kickback is noticed.

When using a compactor on asphalt, Water
Sprinkler Kit is required to help prevent the bottom
plate from adhering to the hot asphalt surface.

When using plate on paving stones, attach a pad to
the bottom of the plate to prevent chipping or
grinding surface of the stones. A special urethane
pad designed for this purpose is available as an
optional accessory.

While a certain amount of moisture in the soil is

necessary, excessive moisture may cause soil
particles to stick together and prevent good
compaction. If soil is extremely wet, allow it to dry
somewhat before compacting.

If soil is so dry as to create dust clouds while
operating plate, some moisture should be added
to the ground material to improve compacting. This
will also reduce service to the air filter.

**Stopping Engine**

To stop the engine in an emergency, simply turn the
engine switch to the OFF position. Under normal
conditions, use the following procedure.

1. Move the throttle lever to the SLOW position.
2. Let engine idle for one or two minutes.
3. Turn the engine switch to the OFF position.
4. Turn the fuel valve lever to the OFF position.

**Do not move choke control to**
**CLOSE to stop engine. Backfire or**
**engine damage may occur.**

12

G

B

**Idle Speed**

Set throttle control lever to its “low” position
to reduce stress on the engine when compacting
is not being performed. Lowering the engine speed
to idle the engine will help extend the life of the
engine, as well as conserve fuel and reduce the
noise level of the machine.

~~**MAINTENANCE**~~

Maintaining your compactor will insure long
life to the machine and its components.

**Preventive Maintenance**

1. Turn off engine. Engine must be cool.
2. Keep the engine’s throttle lever in its SLOW
position, and remove spark plug wire from spark
plug and secure.
3. Inspect the general condition of the plate
compactor. Check for loose screws, misalignment
or binding of moving parts, cracked or broken
parts, and any other condition that may affect its
safe operation.
4. Remove all debris from the plate compactor with
a soft brush, vacuum, or compressed air. Then
use a premium quality lightweight machine oil to
lubricate all moving parts.
5. Clean the bottom of the compactor base as soon
as it begins to pick up soil being compacted. The
unit can not do a good job if the bottom surface is
not smooth and clean.

6. Replace spark plug wire.

**Never use a “pressure washer” to clean**
**your plate compactor. Water can penetrate**
**tight areas of the unit and cause damage to**
**spindles, pulleys, bearings, or the engine. The use**
**of pressure washers will result in shortened life**
**and reduce serviceability.**

**Checking V-Belt(s)**

To ensure optimum power transmission from
the engine to the eccentric shaft, the V-belt(s)
must be in good condition and operate under

13

proper tension.

1. Turn off engine. Engine must be cool.
2. Remove the belt guard to access the V-belt(s).
3. Check the condition of the V-belt(s). If any V-belt
is cracked, frayed, or glazed, it should be replaced
as soon as convenient.
4. Check the V-belt tension by squeezing them in
the center. The normal deflection on each side
should be 9mm (3/8” to 13mm (1/2” with moderate
pressure from your thumb or finger.

**On new machines or after installing a new belt,**
**check belt tension after first 20 hours of operation.**
**Check and adjust belt every 50 hours thereafter.**

**Tensioning V-Belt**

Proper belt tension is critical to good
performance.
Proper adjustment will assure long belt life.

1. If the plate compactor you bought is with
water tank, please pull the water tank up
from the chassis as shown.

2. Loosen the jam nuts B, leaving enough space
between the nut and bracket.

3. Push engine toward the back of the plate
by turning the adjustment bolts A to
remove any slack in V-belt(s).

**When adjusting the belt(s), make**
**sure that the clutch pulley is in**
**alignment with exciter pulley.**

**4.** When the V-belt tension is correct, tighten
the jam nuts B against the bracket.

5. Tighten the engine mount bolts.

6. Replace the belt guard.

**If the adjustment bolts have no more adjustment**
**left, the belt(s) may have to be replaced.**

**Replacing V-Belt(s)**

Both V-belts should be replaced at the same time
because they will wear evenly through normal use.
Work on one belt at a time.

1. Loose 4 engine mount bolts (do not
remove) only enough to move the engine
forward.

2. Loosen the jam nuts B and bolts A shown
in above figure.

3. Slide the engine toward the front of plate
and slip the old V-belt(s) off of the wheel
pulley and install the new V-belt(s) in their
place.

4. Position the V-belt(s) over the engine pulley.

5. Move the engine back.

**When adjusting the belt(s), make sure**
**that the clutch pulley is in alignment with**
**exciter pulley.**

6. When the V-belt tension is correct, tighten
the jam nuts B and the engine mount bolts.

7. Replace the belt guard.

**When removing or installing the drive**
**belt(s), be careful not to get your fingers**
**caught between the belt and pulley.**

1. Let exciter cool before changing exciter oil.

2. Remove the belt guard and V-belt.
3. Remove the bolts that hold the deck to the

housing.
4. Lift entire deck with engine from housing.

5. Remove pipe plug from top of exciter
housing. Tilt housing upside down so oil
drains from exciter. Examine oil for metal

chips as a precaution to future problems.

6. Return plate housing to the upright
position.

7. Fill the exciter housing with exciter oil.

**Do not overfill - overfilling can**
**result in excessive temperatures in**
**the exciter.**

8. Apply pipe sealant to pipe plug and
reinstall into top of exciter housing.
9. Reinstall deck, V-belt(s) and belt guard.

~~**STORAGE**~~

If the plate compactor will not be used for
a period longer than 30 days, following the
steps below to prepare your unit for storage.

1. Drain the fuel tank completely. Stored fuel
containing ethanol or MTBE can start to go
stale in 30 days. Stale fuel has high gum
content and can clog the carburetor and
restrict fuel flow.

2. Start the engine and allow it to run until
it stops. This ensures no fuel is left in the
carburetor. Run the engine until it stops.
This helps prevent deposits from forming
inside the carburetor and possible engine
damage.

3. While the engine is still warm, drain the oil
from the engine. Refill with fresh oil of the
grade recommended in the Engine Manual.

4. Allow the engine to cool. Remove the
spark plug and put 60 ml of SAE-30 of
high quality motor oil into the cylinder. Pull
the starter rope slowly to distribute the oil.
Replace the spark plug.

**Remove the spark plug and drain all**
**of the oil from the cylinder before**
**attempting to start the unit after storage.**

5. Use clean cloths to clean off the outside of

the compactor and to keep the air vents
free of obstructions.

**Do not use strong detergents or petroleum**
**based cleaners when cleaning plastic**
**parts. Chemicals can damage plastics.**

5. Pull up the spring bolt and fold up the
wheels bracket.

6. Carefully fold the handle down. Do not allow
control cables to become pinched or bent.

7. Store your plate compactor in upright
position in a clean, dry building that has
good ventilation.

**Avisos de segurança para**
**Ferramentas em Geral**

**ATENÇÃO** **Leia todos os avisos de segurança e**
**todas as instruções.** Falha em seguir
os avisos e instruções pode resultar em choque elétrico,
incêndio e/ou ferimentos sérios.
**Guarde todos os avisos e instruções de segurança para**
**futuras consultas.**

O termo “ferramenta” em todos os avisos listados abaixo se

refere à ferramenta alimentada através de seu cordão de
alimentação ou a ferramenta operada a bateria (sem cordão
de alimentação).

**1. Segurança da área de trabalho**
**a) Mantenha a área de trabalho limpa e iluminada.** As
áreas desorganizadas e escuras são um convite aos
acidentes.
**b) Não opere ferramentas em atmosferas explosivas,**
**como na presença de líquidos inflamáveis, gases**
**ou poeira.** As ferramentas criam faíscas que podem
inflamar a poeira ou os vapores.
**c) Mantenha crianças e visitantes afastados ao operar**
**uma ferramenta.** As distrações podem fazer você perder
o controle.

**2. Segurança elétrica**
**a) O plugue da ferramenta deve ser compatível com**
**as tomadas. Nunca modifique o plugue. Não use**
**nenhum plugue adaptador para as ferramentas com**
**aterramento.** Os plugues sem modificações aliados à
utilização de tomadas compatíveis reduzem o risco de
choque elétrico.
**b) Evite o contato do seu corpo com superfícies**
**ligadas ao terra ou aterradas, tais como tubulações,**
**radiadores, fogões e refrigeradores.** Há um aumento
no risco de choque elétrico se o seu corpo estiver em
contato ao terra ou aterramento.
**c) Não exponha as ferramentas à chuva ou condições**
**úmidas.** A água entrando na ferramenta aumenta o risco
de choque elétrico.
**d) Não force o cordão de alimentação. Nunca use o**
**cordão de alimentação para carregar, puxar ou para**
**desconectar a ferramenta da tomada. Mantenha o**
**cordão de alimentação longe do calor, óleo, bordas**
**afiadas ou das partes em movimento.** Os cordões de
alimentação danificados ou emaranhados aumentam o
risco de choque elétrico.
**e) Ao operar uma ferramenta ao ar livre, use um cabo**
**de extensão apropriado para uso ao ar livre.** O uso de
um cabo apropriado ao ar livre reduz o risco de choque
elétrico.
**f) Se a operação de uma ferramenta em um local seguro**
**não for possível, use alimentação protegida por um**
**dispositivo de corrente residual (RCD).** O uso de um
RCD reduz o risco de choque elétrico.

Português - BR | **11**

**3. Segurança pessoal**
**a) Fique atento, olhe o que você está fazendo e use o**
**bom senso ao operar uma ferramenta. Não use a**
**ferramenta quando você estiver cansado ou sob a**
**influência de drogas, álcool ou de medicamentos.**
Um momento de desatenção enquanto opera uma
ferramenta pode resultar em grave ferimento pessoal.
**b) Use equipamentos de segurança. Sempre use óculos de**
**segurança.** Equipamentos de segurança como máscara
contra poeira, sapatos de segurança antiderrapantes,
capacete de segurança ou protetor auricular utilizado em
condições apropriadas reduzirão os ferimentos pessoais.
**c) Evite partida não intencional. Assegure-se de que**
**o interruptor está na posição “desligado” antes de**
**conectar o plugue na tomada.** Transportar a ferramenta
com seu dedo no interruptor ou conectar a ferramenta
com o interruptor na posição “ligado” são convites a
acidentes.
**d) Remova qualquer chave de ajuste antes de ligar a**
**ferramenta.** Uma chave de boca ou de ajuste conectada
a uma parte rotativa da ferramenta pode resultar em
ferimento pessoal.
**e) Não force além do limite. Mantenha o apoio e o**
**equilíbrio adequado todas as vezes que utilizar a**
**ferramenta.** Isso permite melhor controle da ferramenta
em situações inesperadas.
**f) Vista-se apropriadamente. Não use roupas**
**demasiadamente largas ou jóias. Mantenha seus**
**cabelos, roupas e luvas longe das peças móveis.** A
roupa folgada, jóias ou cabelos longos podem ser presos
pelas partes em movimento.
**g) Se os dispositivos são fornecidos com conexão para**
**extração e coleta de pó, assegure que estes estejam**
**conectados e utilizados corretamente.** O uso destes
dispositivos pode reduzir riscos relacionados à poeira.
**h) Use protetores auriculares.** Exposição a ruído pode
provocar perda auditiva.

**4. Uso e cuidados com a ferramenta**

**a) Não force a ferramenta. Use a ferramenta correta**
**para sua aplicação.** A ferramenta correta fará o trabalho
melhor e mais seguro se utilizada dentro daquilo para o
qual foi projetada.
**b) Não use a ferramenta se o interruptor não ligar**
**ou desligar.** Qualquer ferramenta que não pode ser
controlada com o interruptor é perigosa e deve ser
reparada.
**c) Desconecte o plugue da tomada antes de fazer**
**qualquer tipo de ajuste, mudança de acessórios ou**
**armazenamento de ferramentas.** Tais medidas
preventivas de segurança reduzem o risco de se ligar a
ferramenta acidentalmente.
**d) Guarde as ferramentas fora do alcance das crianças e não**
**permita que pessoas não familiarizadas com a ferramenta**
**ou com estas instruções operem a ferramenta.** As
ferramentas são perigosas nas mãos de usuários não treinados.

**e) Manutenção das ferramentas. Verifique o**
**desalinhamento ou coesão das partes móveis,**
**rachaduras e qualquer outra condição que possa**
**afetar a operação da ferramenta. Se danificada, a**
**ferramenta deve ser reparada antes do uso.** Muitos
acidentes são causados pela inadequada manutenção das
ferramentas.
**f) Mantenha ferramentas de corte afiadas e limpas.**
A manutenção apropriada das ferramentas de corte
com lâminas afiadas tornam estas menos prováveis ao
emperramento e são mais fáceis de controlar.
**g) Use a ferramenta, acessórios, suas partes etc. de**
**acordo com as instruções e da maneira designada**
**para o tipo particular da ferramenta, levando**
**em consideração as condições e o trabalho a ser**
**realizado.** O uso da ferramenta em operações diferentes
das designadas pode resultar em situações de risco.

**5. Reparos**
**a) Tenha sua ferramenta reparada por uma assistência**
**técnica autorizada e somente use peças originais.** Isto
assegura que a segurança da ferramenta seja mantida.
**b) Em caso de desgaste da escovas de carvão, enviar a**
**ferramenta a uma assistência técnica autorizada para**
**substituição.** Escovas de carvão fora das especificações
causam danos ao motor da ferramenta.
**c) Se o cabo de alimentação se encontra danificado,**
**deve ser substituído pelo fabricante através de seu**
**serviço técnico ou pessoa qualificada, para prevenir**
**risco de choque elétrico.**
**Indicações de segurança para martelos**

u **Usar proteção auricular.** Ruídos podem provocar a surdez.
u **Utilizar os punhos adicionais, se tiverem sido**
**fornecidos com a ferramenta elétrica.** A perda de
controlo pode provocar lesões.
u **Ao executar trabalhos durante os quais a ferramenta**
**de trabalho ou o parafuso possam atingir cabos**
**elétricos que se encontrem sob a superfície a ser**
**trabalhada ou o próprio cabo de rede, deverá sempre**
**segurar o aparelho pelas superfícies isoladas do**
**punho.** O contato com um cabo sob tensão também pode
colocar sob tensão as peças metálicas do aparelho e levar
a um choque eléctrico.
**Indicações de segurança e de**
**trabalho adicionais**

u **Observar a tensão de rede!** A tensão da fonte de
corrente deve coincidir com a chapa de identificação da
ferramenta elétrica.
u **Utilizar detectores apropriados, para encontrar**
**cabos escondidos, ou consultar a companhia elétrica**
**local.** O contato com cabos elétricos pode provocar
incêndio e choques elétricos. Danos em tubos de gás
podem levar à explosão. A infiltração num cano de água
provoca danos materiais.

u **Apertar firmemente o punho adicional, durante o**
**trabalho deverá segurar a ferramenta elétrica**
**firmemente com ambas as mãos e manter uma posição**
**segura.** A ferramenta elétrica é conduzida com segurança
com ambas as mãos.
u **Fixar a peça a ser trabalhada.** Uma peça a ser trabalhada
fixa com dispositivos de aperto ou com torno de bancada
está mais firme do que segurada com a mão.
u Para furar, sem impacto, em madeira, metal, cerâmica e
plástico, assim como para furar são usadas ferramentas
sem SDS-plus (p.ex. brocas com encabadouro cilíndrico).
Para estas ferramentas são necessários um mandril de
brocas de aperto rápido ou um mandril de brocas de
coroa dentada.
u O mandril de brocas trava-se automaticamente. Puxar o
mandril de brocas para controlar o travamento.
u **Introduzir a ferramenta de trabalho SDS-plus:** Puxar a
ferramenta para controlar o travamento.
u **Uma capa de proteção contra pó danificada deve**
**ser substituída imediatamente.** A capa de proteção
contra pó evita, consideravelmente, que penetre pó de
perfuração no encabadouro durante o funcionamento. Ao
introduzir a ferramenta deverá assegurar-se de que a capa
de proteção contra pó não seja danificada.
u **Pós de materiais, como por exemplo tintas que contêm**
**chumbo, alguns tipos de madeira, minerais e metais**
**podem ser nocivos à saúde e provocar reações**
**alérgicas, doenças das vias respiratórias e/ou a**
**cancro.** Material que contém asbesto só deve ser
processado por pessoal especializado.
-Se possível deverá usar um dispositivo de aspiração
apropriado para o material.
-Assegurar uma boa ventilação do local de trabalho.
-É recomendável usar uma máscara de proteção
respiratória com filtro da classe P2.
Observe as diretivas para os materiais a serem trabalhados,
vigentes no seu país.
u **Evite o acúmulo de pó no local de trabalho.** Pós podem
entrar levemente em ignição.
u **Se a ferramenta de trabalho bloquear, deverá desligar**
**a ferramenta elétrica. Soltar a ferramenta de trabalho.**
u **Assegure-se de que ao ligar a ferramenta elétrica, a**
**ferramenta de trabalho se movimente livremente.**
Ao ligar o aparelho com uma broca bloqueada são
produzidos altos momentos de reação.
u **Espere a ferramenta elétrica parar completamente,**
**antes de depositá-la.** A ferramenta de aplicação pode
emperrar e levar à perda de controle sobre a ferramenta
elétrica.

**Informação sobre ruídos/vibrações**

Os valores de medição do produto encontram-se na tabela
da página 10.

**Montagem de funcionamento**

Valores totais de vibração e ruído (soma dos vetores das três
direções) apurados conforme EN 60745.
O nível de oscilações indicado nestas instruções de serviço
foi medido de acordo com um processo de medição
normalizado pela norma EN 60745 e pode ser utilizado para
a comparação de aparelhos. Ele também é apropriado para
uma avaliação provisória da carga de vibrações.
O nível de vibrações indicado representa as aplicações
principais da ferramenta elétrica. Se a ferramenta elétrica
for utilizada para outras aplicações, com outras ferramentas
de trabalho ou com manutenção insuficiente, é possível
que o nível de vibrações seja diferente. Isto pode aumentar
sensivelmente a carga de vibrações para o período completo
de trabalho. Para uma estimação exata da carga de
vibrações, também deveriam ser considerados os períodos
nos quais o aparelho está desligado ou funciona, mas não
está sendo utilizado. Isto pode reduzir a carga de vibrações
durante o completo período de trabalho.
Além disso também deverão ser estipuladas medidas de
segurança para proteger o operador contra o efeito de
vibrações, como por exemplo: Manutenção de ferramentas
elétricas e de ferramentas de trabalho, manter as mãos
quentes e organização dos processos de trabalho.

A seguinte tabela indica os objetivos de ação para a montagem e a operação da ferramenta elétrica. As instruções dos objetivos
de ação são mostradas na figura indicada. Dependendo do tipo da aplicação, são necessárias diferentes combinações de

**Instrucciones de seguridad para**
**martillos**

u **Utilice unos protectores auditivos.** El ruido intenso puede
provocar sordera.
u **Emplee la(s) empuñadura(s) adicional(es), caso de**
**suministrarse con la herramienta eléctrica.** La pérdida
de control sobre la herramienta eléctrica puede provocar un
accidente.

u **Sujete el aparato por las empuñaduras aisladas al**
**efectuar trabajos en los que el útil o el tornillo puedan**
**tocar conductores eléctricos ocultos o el propio cable del**
**aparato.** El contacto con conductores bajo tensión puede
hacer que las partes metálicas de la herramienta eléctrica le
provoquen una descarga eléctrica.
**Instrucciones de seguridad y**
**operación adicionales**

u **¡Observe la tensión de red!** La tensión de alimentación
deberá coincidir con las indicaciones en la placa de
características de la herramienta eléctrica.

u **Utilice unos aparatos de exploración adecuados para**
**detectar conductores o tuberías ocultas, o consulte a sus**
**compañías abastecedoras.** El contacto con conductores
eléctricos puede provocar un incendio o una electrocución.
Al dañar una tubería de gas puede producirse una explosión.
La perforación de una tubería de agua puede causar daños
materiales.
u **Apriete con firmeza la empuñadura adicional y trabaje**
**sujetando fuertemente la herramienta eléctrica con**
**ambas manos, cuidando de mantener una posición**
**estable.** Utilizando ambas manos la herramienta eléctrica es
guiada de forma segura.
u **Asegure la pieza de trabajo.** Una pieza de trabajo fijada
con unos dispositivos de sujeción, o en un tornillo de banco,se
mantiene sujeta de forma mucho más segura que con la mano.
u Para taladrar sin percusión en madera, metal, cerámica y
plástico, así como para atornillar se utilizan útiles sin vástago
SDS-plus (p.ej. brocas de vástago cilíndrico).
Para estos útiles se precisa un portabrocas de sujeción rápida
o un portabrocas de corona dentada.
u El portabrocas intercambiable se enclava automáticamente.
Tire del portabrocas intercambiable para asegurarse de que
ha quedado correctamente sujeto.
u **Montaje del útil SDS-plus:** Tire del útil para asegurarse de
que ha quedado correctamente sujeto.
u Deje sustituir inmediatamente una caperuza antipolvo
deteriorada. La caperuza antipolvo evita en gran medida
que el polvo producido al trabajar no logre penetrar en el
portaútiles. Al montar el útil, preste atención a no dañar la
caperuza antipolvo.
u **El polvo de ciertos materiales como pinturas que**
**contengan plomo, ciertos tipos de madera, algunos**

**minerales y metales puede ser nocivo para la salud,**
**provocar reacciones alérgicas, enfermedades espiratorias**
**y/o cáncer.** Los materiales que contengan amianto solamente
deberán ser procesados por especialistas.
-A ser posible utilice un equipo para aspiración de polvo
apropiado para el material a trabajar.
-Observe que esté bien ventilado el puesto de trabajo.
-Se recomienda una mascarilla protectora con un filtro de la
clase P2.

Observe las prescripciones vigentes en su país sobre los
materiales a trabajar.
u **Evite acumulaciones de polvo en el puesto de trabajo.**
Los materiales en polvo se pueden inflamar fácilmente.
u **Si el útil se llega a bloquear, desconecte la herramienta**
**eléctrica. Desbloquee el útil.**
u **Antes de conectar la herramienta eléctrica asegúrese**
**primero de que el útil pueda moverse libremente.** Si la
herramienta eléctrica se conecta estando bloqueado el útil de
taladrar se producen unos pares de reacción muy elevados.
u **Antes de depositarla, esperar a que se haya detenido la**
**herramienta eléctrica.** El útil puede engancharse y hacerle
perder el control sobre la herramienta eléctrica.

Nivel total de ruido y vibraciones (suma vectorial de tres
direcciones) determinado según EN 60745.
El nivel de vibraciones indicado en estas instrucciones ha sido
determinado según el procedimiento de medición fijado en la
norma EN 60745 y puede servir como base de comparación
con otras herramientas eléctricas. También es adecuado para
estimar provisionalmente la solicitación experimentada por
las vibraciones.
El nivel de vibraciones indicado ha sido determinado para las
aplicaciones principales de la herramienta eléctrica. Por ello,
el nivel de vibraciones puede ser diferente si la herramienta
eléctrica se utiliza para otras aplicaciones, con útiles
diferentes, o si el mantenimiento de la misma fuese deficiente.

Ello puede suponer un aumento drástico de la solicitación por
vibraciones durante el tiempo total de trabajo.
Para determinar con exactitud la solicitación experimentada
por las vibraciones, es necesario considerar también aquellos
tiempos en los que el aparato esté desconectado, o bien,
esté en funcionamiento, pero sin ser utilizado realmente. Ello
puede suponer una disminución drástica de la solicitación por
vibraciones durante el tiempo total de trabajo.
Fije unas medidas de seguridad adicionales para proteger al
usuario de los efectos por vibraciones, como por ejemplo:
Mantenimiento de la herramienta eléctrica y de los útiles,
conservar calientes las manos, organización de las secuencias
de trabajo.

**Montaje y operación**
En la tabla siguiente se indican los objetivos para el montaje y la operación de la herramienta eléctrica. Las instrucciones y los
objetivos se muestran en la figura indicada. Según cual sea la aplicación deberán combinarse las instrucciones de distintas

**Tabla 3-1: Noise Metrics****

| Metric | Abbreviation | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <br><br>~~A-weighted Sound Level~~<br> | <br><br>~~dBA~~<br> | <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br><br>~~A-weighted sound levels represent the overall noise at a receiver that~~<br>is adjusted in frequency to approximate typical human hearing<br>sensitivity. This is expressed as A-weighted decibels (dBA), the basic<br>noise unit for transit noise analyses.<br> |
| <br><br>~~Sound Exposure Level~~<br> | <br><br>~~_SEL_~~<br> | <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br><br><br>~~SEL is the cumulative noise exposure from a single noise event,~~<br>normalized to one second. SEL contains the same overall sound<br>energy as the actual varying sound energy during the event. It is the<br>primary metric for the measurement of transit vehicle noise<br>emissions, and is an intermediate metric in the measurement and<br>calculation of both Leq(t)and Ldn. <br> |
| <br><br>~~Equivalent Sound Level~~<br> | <br>~~L~~eq(t)<br> | <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>~~The equivalent sound level L~~eq(t)~~describes a receiver's cumulative~~<br>noise exposure from all events normalized to a specified period of<br>time “t”. Leq(t)represents a hypothetical, constant sound level and<br>contains the same overall sound energy as the actual varying sound<br>energy during the time period “t”. For transit noise impact<br>assessments, the equivalent sound level metric is A-weighted and all<br>events are normalized over a one-hour time period, Leq(1hr). For transit<br>noise assessments, this metric is appropriate for non-residential land<br>uses and is computed for the loudest hour of project related activity<br>during hours of noise sensitivity.<br> |
| <br><br>~~Day-Night Sound Level~~<br> | <br><br>~~L~~dn<br> | <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>~~L~~dn~~describes a receiver's cumulative noise exposure from all events~~<br>over 24 hours. Events between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. are increased by 10<br>dB to account for humans’ greater nighttime sensitivity to noise. Ldnis<br>used to assess transit noise for residential land uses.<br> |
| <br><br>~~Maximum Sound Level~~ | <br>~~L~~max | <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>~~The maximum level describes the maximum noise level reached~~<br>during a single noise event. For transit noise impact assessments, it is<br>appropriate to consider the A-weighted maximum level (Lmax) to<br>understand the full context of the scenario. It is not appropriate to<br>use this metric for transit noise impact assessments. This metric is<br>commonly used in vehicle noise specifications and commonly<br>measured for individual vehicles. |

**Tabla 4-4: Levels of Impact****

| Level of Impact | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <br><br>~~No Impact~~<br> | <br> <br> <br><br>~~Project-generated noise is not likely to cause community annoyance. Noise~~<br>projections in this range are considered acceptable by FTA and mitigation is<br>not required.<br> |
| <br><br>~~Moderate Impact~~<br> | <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>~~Project-generated noise in this range is considered to cause impact at the~~<br>threshold of measurable annoyance. Moderate impacts serve as an alert to<br>project planners for potential adverse impacts and complaints from the<br>community. Mitigation should be considered at this level of impact based on<br>project specifics and details concerning the affected properties.<br> |
| <br>~~Severe Impact~~ | <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>~~Project-generated noise in this range is likely to cause a high level of~~<br>community annoyance. The project sponsor should first evaluate alternative<br>locations/alignments to determine whether it is feasible to avoid severe impacts<br>altogether. In densely populated urban areas, evaluation of alternative locations<br>may reveal a trade-off of affected groups, particularly for surface rail<br>alignments. Projects that are characterized as point sources rather than line<br>sources often present greater opportunity for selecting alternative sites. This<br>guidance manual and FTA's environmental impact regulations both encourage<br>project sites which are compatible with surrounding development when<br>possible. If it is not practical to avoid severe impacts by changing the location of<br>the project, mitigation measures must be considered. |

Resilient wheels on rail transit systems can provide<br>some vibration reduction over solid steel wheels, but are usually too stiff to<br>provide substantial reduction. For more information, see Section 6.4, Step 2.<br> |
| <br><br>Guideway | <br> <br>~~Track/Roadway~~<br>Surface | <br> <br> <br> <br><br>~~Rough track or rough roads are often sources of excessive vibration. Maintaining~~<br>a smooth surface will reduce vibration levels.<br> |

The highest vibration levels are created by<br>track that is rigidly attached to a concrete trackbed (e.g., track on wood half-ties<br>embedded in the concrete). The vibration levels are much lower when special<br>vibration control track systems such as resilient fasteners, ballast mats, and<br>floating slabs are used.<br> |
| <br><br>Guideway | <br>Transit<br>Structure | <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>~~Heavier transit structures typically result in the lower vibration levels. The~~<br>vibration levels from a lightweight bored tunnel will usually be higher than from a<br>poured concrete box subway.<br> |

| Receiver Building<br>Factors | Influence |
| --- | --- |

| <br>Acoustical<br>absorption | <br> <br> <br> <br>~~The more acoustically absorptive materials in the receiver room, the lower the~~<br>ground-borne noise level.

Abstract

This report is the third edition of a guidance manual originally issued in 1995. It includes clarifications to
existing policy and updates to outdated references where applicable. Topics presented in this manual
include procedures for predicting and assessing noise and vibration impacts of proposed transit projects
for different stages of project development and different levels of analysis. Additional topics include
descriptions of noise and vibration mitigation measures, construction noise and vibration, and how to
present these analyses in the Federal Transit Administration’s environmental documents. This guidance
is for technical specialists who conduct the analyses, as well as project sponsor staff, Federal agency
reviewers, and members of the general public who may be affected by the projects.

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

Introduction

1.1 Purpose
The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations for implementing the
procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
(NEPA) [(1,2) ] require that a federally-funded project be assessed for its impact on
the human and natural environment prior to implementation. The Federal
Transit Administration (FTA), in conjunction with the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA), has issued detailed regulations implementing NEPA for
transit and highway projects. The regulations are codified in part 771 of title 23,
Code of Federal Regulations, and are titled “Environmental Impact and Related
[Procedures.” (23 CFR part 771).](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=da8964b2f12aafce2f1e7f4bdb6128af&node=23:1.0.1.8.43&rgn=div5) [(3) ]

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provides financial assistance for a
range of public transportation projects from new rail rapid transit (RRT)
systems to bus maintenance facilities and vehicle purchases. As required by
NEPA and its implementing regulations, each project must undergo
environmental review.

Noise and vibration are sometimes among the major concerns regarding the
effects of a transit project on the surrounding community and are key elements
of the environmental impact assessment process for public transportation
projects. A transit system is often placed near population centers by necessity
and may cause noise and vibration at nearby residences and other sensitive
types of land use.

This manual provides technical guidance for conducting noise and vibration
analyses for transit projects, as well as direction regarding preparation of the
information for FTA’s environmental documents. Some situations may not be
explicitly covered in this manual; the exercise of professional judgment may be
required to extend the basic methods in these cases and frequent consultation
with FTA staff is important to ensure the methods used meet the requirements
for environmental reviews. See Appendix G for information on using non­
standard modeling procedures.

In general, the noise and vibration impact assessment process for projects
includes the following steps:

1. Determine appropriate impact criteria (Section 4.1).

2. Conduct screening and determine appropriate level of noise analysis,
analyze project noise impacts, and evaluate mitigation options if
appropriate (Sections 4.2-4.5).

3. Determine appropriate level of vibration analysis, analyze project
vibration impacts, and evaluate mitigation options if appropriate
(Sections 6.1-6.5).

4. Analyze construction noise and vibration impacts (Section 7).

5. Document findings (Section 8).

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

Project Class of Action and Planning

The level of environmental analysis and review depends on the significance of
any potential associated environmental impacts, which in turn depends in part
on the scope and complexity of the proposed project. The goals of a transit
noise and vibration impact assessment are to:

1. Determine existing noise and vibration levels.
2. Assess project noise and vibration for potential impact.
3. Evaluate the effect of mitigation options on impacts.

The class of action determination will inform the required level of analysis. The
[FTA Regional office](https://www.transit.dot.gov/about/regional-offices/regional-offices) [(i) ] determines the class of action based on project
information provided by the project sponsor. The following types of information
can assist the FTA Regional office in an initial class of action determination for a
project:

 - Project description

 - Project-specific graphics, including:
 Project location/sizes
 Known land use and environmental features

 - Additional information, as appropriate:
 Summary of prior planning
 Draft purpose and need statement

Project classes of action are described in Section 2.1. Project planning and
development guidelines are presented in Section 2.2.

2.1 Project Class of Action

FTA's environmental regulations classify projects by level of environmental
analysis. The class of action will determine the appropriate level of analysis and
documentation for a project. Details of each class are described in the following
sections. For more information, review FTA's environmental impact and related
[procedures at 23 CFR part 771.](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=da8964b2f12aafce2f1e7f4bdb6128af&node=23:1.0.1.8.43&rgn=div5)

**Environmental Impact Statements**
Environmental impact statements (EISs) apply to projects that are expected to
cause significant environmental effects in the NEPA context. Typical examples
include new or extensions of fixed-guideway projects, such as heavy rail, light
rail, commuter rail, and automated guideway transit (AGT) systems that are not
located within existing transportation right-of-way (ROW). It is likely that for
major infrastructure projects requiring an EIS, the most detailed treatment of
noise and vibration impacts will often be required.

**Categorical Exclusions**
Categorical exclusions (CEs) cover actions that are excluded from requiring an
EIS or environmental assessment (EA) because FTA has determined that they do

i

[http://www.fta.dot.gov/12926.html.](http://www.fta.dot.gov/12926.html)

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 3

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

not routinely cause significant environmental impacts. FTA’s CEs are located at
23 CFR §§ 771.118(c) and (d), commonly referred to as the c-list and d-list,
respectively. Examples of projects that would normally be CEs include vehicle
purchases, maintenance of equipment, vehicles, or facilities, and ROW
acquisition.
In general, CEs for transit capital construction projects often require at least a
screening of noise impacts.

**Environmental Assessments**

When a proposed project is presented to FTA and it is uncertain whether the
project requires an EIS or qualifies for a CE, FTA will normally direct the
project sponsor to prepare an environmental assessment (EA) to assist in
making the determination. An EA may be prepared for any type of project if
uncertainty exists about the magnitude or extent of the impacts. Generally, an
EA is selected over a CE if FTA determines that several types of potential
impacts require further investigation, for example, air quality, noise, wetlands,
historic sites, and/or traffic, but FTA’s environmental regulation does not list
typical projects that require EAs.
Experience shows that most of the EAs prepared for transit projects require at
least a general assessment of noise impacts.

2.2 Project Planning and Development

Capital transit projects are ordinarily developed initially from a comprehensive
transportation planning process conducted in metropolitan areas (see 23 CFR §
450.300). [(4) ] The metropolitan planning process often includes some early
consideration of social, economic, and environmental effects of proposed major
infrastructure improvements. At this stage, environmental effects are usually
considered on a broad scale--for example, overall development patterns,
impacts on green space, and regional air quality. Noise and vibration
assessments are not typically performed at this stage because the proposed
infrastructure improvements lack the necessary detail.

Once the need for a capital transit project in a corridor is established in the
metropolitan transportation plan, the transit mode and general alignment best
suited for the corridor are identified. The Screening and General noise
assessment procedures and the vibration screening procedure described in this
manual may be used to compare noise and vibration effects among different
transit modes and alignments at an early stage of the project planning. The
analysis that results is documented through the environmental review process.

NEPA establishes a broad policy regarding mitigation as a means of
accomplishing its environmental objectives. Other Federal laws, such as Section
4(f) (49 U.S.C. 303) and Section 404 (33 U.S.C. 1344), have explicit mitigation
requirements for certain resources. The decision to include noise or vibration
mitigation for a project is made by FTA and the project sponsor after public
review of the environmental document, as appropriate. If mitigation measures
are deemed necessary to protect the environment or to satisfy statutory
requirements, they will be incorporated as an integral part of the project and
subsequent grant documents will reference these measures as contractual
obligations on the part of the project sponsor. Through that process, FTA

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 4

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

ensures that the project sponsor complies with all design and mitigation
commitments contained in the environmental record.

Once the project enters construction, noise or vibration may need to be
reassessed in some circumstances. Some large construction projects in densely
populated residential areas may require noise monitoring to ensure agreed-upon
noise limits are not exceeded. Vibration testing may be needed in the final
stages of construction to determine whether vibration control measures have
the predicted effect.

Considering that transit projects must be located amid or very close to
concentrations of people, noise and vibration impacts can be a concern
throughout the environmental review process, design, and construction phases.
This manual offers the flexibility to address noise and vibration at different
stages in the development of a project and in different levels of detail.

2.3 Mitigation Policy Considerations

Because noise is frequently among the greatest environmental concerns of
planned transit projects, FTA and the project sponsor should make reasonable
efforts to reduce predicted noise to levels considered acceptable for affected
noise-sensitive land uses. The need for noise mitigation is determined based on
the magnitude of impact and consideration of factors specifically related to the
proposed project and affected land uses.

The goal of providing noise mitigation is to gain substantial noise reduction, not
simply to reduce the predicted levels to just below the “severe” impact
threshold. For FTA to determine whether the mitigation is reasonable, the
evaluation of specific mitigation measures should include the noise reduction
potential, the cost, the effect on transit operations and maintenance, and any
other relevant factors, such as any new environmental impacts that may be
caused by the implementation of a noise reduction measure. A thorough
evaluation enables FTA to make the findings required by NEPA and other
statutes, such as Section 4(f) or Section 106 requirements and their
implementing regulations.

Severe impacts have the greatest adverse impact on the community, and
mitigation should be strongly considered. Areas with “moderate” impacts also
have potential for effects on the community and therefore should also include
consideration and possible adoption of mitigation measures when considered
reasonable.

Since reasonableness is not strictly defined, FTA recommends that project
sponsors work with the affected public and FTA staff during the environmental
review process to decide appropriate mitigation strategies. A project sponsor
may also consider developing and formally adopting a mitigation policy to aid in
the determination of appropriate and applicable mitigation measures for current
and proposed projects and anticipated impacts. Having such a policy in place can
aid in the project planning up front and help to expedite mitigation decisions.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 5

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

The following considerations can assist in determining circumstances that trigger
the need for mitigation and include examples of how they can be applied in a
noise mitigation policy:

- **Number of Noise-Sensitive Sites Affected**
A row or cluster of residences adjacent to a rail transit line establishes a
greater need for mitigation than one or several isolated residences in a
mixed-use area. Single residences may not be able to meet a costeffectiveness criterion for mitigation.

_**Example Mitigation Policy Consideration:**_ Set a minimum number of
noise-sensitive sites as a threshold, combined with a reference to a costeffectiveness criterion.

- **Increase over Existing Noise Levels**
Since the noise impact criteria are delineated as bands or ranges, project
noise can vary 5 to 7 decibels (dB) within the band of moderate impact at
any specific ambient noise level. If the project and ambient noise plot falls
just below the severe range, the need for mitigation is strongest for a
moderate impact. Similarly, if the plot falls within the moderate range just
above the no impact threshold, the impacts are expected to be less, so the
justification for mitigation would not be as strong.

_**Example Mitigation Policy Consideration:**_ Set a strong need for
mitigation when a moderate impact is 2 dB (for example) over the no
impact threshold.

- **Noise Sensitivity of the Property**
Section 4.1 includes a comprehensive list of noise-sensitive land uses, yet
there can be differences in noise sensitivity depending on individual
circumstances. For example, parks and recreational areas vary in their
sensitivity depending on the type of use they experience (active vs. passive
recreation) and the settings in which they are located.

_**Example Mitigation Policy Consideration:**_ Cite the use of the property
as a determination of sensitivity for parks and recreational areas.

- **Effectiveness of the Mitigation Measure(s)**
Determine the magnitude of the noise reduction that can be achieved, and
consider whether there are conditions that limit effectiveness, such as noise
barrier effectiveness for a multi-story apartment building.

_**Example Mitigation Policy Consideration:**_ Set a minimum reduction in
noise level to be considered effective. A 5-dB reduction is typically
considered an effective reduction from mitigation.

- **Feasibility of the Mitigation Measure(s)**
Determine if the mitigation measure is feasible from an engineering,
operations or safety perspective. In some cases, it may not be possible to
construct mitigation (noise barriers) due to physical or structural limitations

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 6

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

or because of safety concerns, especially related to sight lines for
pedestrians and vehicles.

_**Example Mitigation Policy Consideration:**_ State that the engineering
design of the mitigation must be feasible, that it must be implementable in
light of operations, and that mitigation must not compromise safety.

- **Fairness and Equity of the Mitigation Measure(s)**
Ensure that mitigation measures are applied in a fair and equitable manner.
In many cases, small differences in distances or operations can result in small
differences in projected noise levels. For example, all the residences in a
row could have a projected moderate impact except for one residence at
the end of the row that falls just under the moderate criteria due to being
set slightly further back from the alignment. In a case like this, mitigation
should be applied for the entire row of residences if possible.

_**Example Mitigation Policy Consideration:**_ State that mitigation should be
applied equitably.

- **Existing Transportation Noise**
Neighborhoods with ambient noise levels already heavily influenced by
transportation noise, especially the same type of noise source as the
project, should be considered. Often adding a new similar noise source will
not add to the ambient noise levels or only slightly increase it to within
acceptable levels. Whereas, impacts would be more likely, if the new noise
was added to a neighborhood with minimal transportation noise. However,
it is important to note that per (Section 4.1, Step 3) the higher the existing
noise, the lower the allowable noise increase from new sources. A new
cumulative noise environment may be very objectionable because people
will not be compartmentalizing the existing noise versus the new noise and
reacting only to the new noise. In this circumstance, impacts predicted in
the moderate range could be treated as if they were severe.

_**Example Mitigation Policy Consideration:**_ Set a policy that moderate
impacts under these circumstances be treated as severe and cite the
potential for reducing noise from existing transportation noise, as well as
from project noise.

- **Community Views**
This manual provides the methodology to make an objective assessment of
the need for noise mitigation. However, the views of the community should
be considered where there are potential noise impacts predicted through
this manual. The NEPA compliance process provides the framework for
hearing the community's concerns about a proposed project and then
making a good-faith effort to address those concerns. Many projects can be
expected to have projected noise levels within the moderate impact range
and, where possible, decisions regarding mitigation should be made after
considering input from the affected public, relevant government agencies,
and community organizations. There have been cases where the solution to
the noise problem, a noise barrier, was not preferable to community
members because of perceived adverse visual effects.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 7

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

_**Example Mitigation Policy Consideration:**_ State that community input in
determining the need for mitigation will be included whenever possible.

- **Implementation Cost**
Cost is an important consideration in reaching decisions about noise
mitigation measures. One guideline for gauging the reasonableness of the
cost of mitigation is the state DOT’s procedures on the subject. Many states
have established their own cost threshold per benefited residence for
determining whether installation of noise barriers for noise reduction is a
reasonable expenditure. Several airport authorities have placed limits on the
costs they will incur for sound insulation per residence for homes, and FTA
assesses cost in a similar manner by benefited residence. Higher costs may
be justified depending on the specific set of circumstances of a project.

_**Example Mitigation Policy Consideration:**_ State the adopted cost
threshold per benefited receiver for typical circumstances.

Transit Noise

This section presents the basic concepts of transit noise as background for
computation methods and transit noise assessment procedures presented in
Section 4. An overview of fundamental noise topics, including amplitude,
frequency, time pattern, and decibel addition, is presented in Appendix B.

The Source-Path-Receiver framework for noise illustrated in Figure 3-1 is
central to all environmental noise studies. Each transit source generates noise
that depends upon the type of source and its operating characteristics. Along
the propagation path, between all sources and receivers, noise levels can be
reduced (attenuated) by distance depending on ground type, intervening
obstacles, and other factors. Finally, noise combines from multiple sources at
each receiver and potentially interferes with activities at that location.

**Figure 3-1 Source-Path-Receiver Framework**

This section contains the following:

 - Section 3.1 presents the noise metrics used in this manual.

 - Section 3.2 provides an overview of transit noise sources, including a
listing of major sources and a discussion of noise-generation
mechanisms.

 - Section 3.3 provides an overview of noise paths, including a discussion
of the various attenuating mechanisms on the path between source and
receiver.

 - Section 3.4 provides an overview of receiver response to transit noise,
including a discussion of the technical background for transit noise
criteria and the distinction between absolute and relative noise impact.

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

3.1 Noise Metrics

This manual uses the noise metrics outlined in Table 3-1 for transit noise

measurements, computations, and assessment. The terminology is consistent
with common usage in the United States. All of these noise metrics are
expressed in units of A-weighted decibels (dBA). A-weighted sound levels
represent the overall noise at a receiver that is adjusted in frequency to
approximate typical human hearing sensitivity. This is the basic noise unit for
transit noise analyses.

**Table 3-1 Noise Metrics**

|Metric|Abbreviation|Definition|
|---|---|---|
|<br><br>~~A-weighted Sound Level~~<br>|<br><br>~~dBA~~<br>|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br><br>~~A-weighted sound levels represent the overall noise at a receiver that~~<br>is adjusted in frequency to approximate typical human hearing<br>sensitivity.

SEL contains the same overall sound<br>energy as the actual varying sound energy during the event. It is the<br>primary metric for the measurement of transit vehicle noise<br>emissions, and is an intermediate metric in the measurement and<br>calculation of both Leq(t)and Ldn. <br>|

Leq(t)represents a hypothetical, constant sound level and<br>contains the same overall sound energy as the actual varying sound<br>energy during the time period “t”. For transit noise impact<br>assessments, the equivalent sound level metric is A-weighted and all<br>events are normalized over a one-hour time period, Leq(1hr).

It is not appropriate to<br>use this metric for transit noise impact assessments. This metric is<br>commonly used in vehicle noise specifications and commonly<br>measured for individual vehicles.|

The noise metrics, including their application to transit noise and vibration
impact assessment, are described in more detail in Appendix B.1.4. Mathematical
definitions and graphic illustrations are presented to facilitate understanding and
the interrelationships among metrics.

3.2 Sources of Transit Vehicle Noise

This section discusses major characteristics of the sources of transit noise.
Transit noise can be generated by transit vehicles in motion, stationary transit

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 10

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

vehicles, and fixed-transit facilities. Procedures for computing nearby noise
levels for major sources as a function of operating parameters such as vehicle
speed are given in Sections 4.4 and 4.5.

**Transit Vehicles in Motion**
Transit vehicles most noticeably create noise when in motion. Noise from
transit vehicles in motion can come from multiple sources, including the
propulsion unit (i.e., the engine and engine components), the interaction of the
wheels and/or tires and the running surface, and warning bells and horns.

Vehicle propulsion units generate:

 - Whine from electric control systems and traction motors that propel
rapid transit cars

 - Diesel-engine exhaust noise from both diesel-electric locomotives and
transit buses

 - Air-turbulence noise generated by cooling fans

 - Gear noise

Noise is also generated by the interaction of wheels and/or tires with their
running surfaces. Tire noise from rubber-tired vehicles is generated at normal
operating speeds. The interaction of steel wheels and rails generates:

 - Rolling noise due to continuous rolling contact

 - Impact noise when a wheel encounters a discontinuity in the running
surface such as a rail joint, turnout or crossover (where the train or rail
vehicle switches off one track and onto another)

 - Impact noise from the wheel and running surface if the wheel is not
completely round (wheel flat) or if the running surface is not completely
flat

 - Squeal generated by friction between wheels and rail on tight curves

Transit vehicles are equipped with horns and bells for use in emergency
situations and as a general audible warning to track workers and trespassers
within the ROW, pedestrians, and motor vehicles at highway grade crossings.
Horns and bells on the moving transit vehicle combined with stationary bells atgrade crossings can generate high noise levels for nearby residents and are often
sources of complaints.

For many noise sources, such as transit vehicles, the sound level is dependent
on the speed of the noise source. In other cases, such as for stationary sources
or horns mounted on vehicles, the sound level is not dependent on speed.
Figure 3-2 illustrates sound level dependence on speed for a diesel-powered
commuter rail train and an electric-powered transit train assuming all other
parameters, such as weight, are equal. Plotted vertically in this figure is a
notional indication of the maximum sound level during a passby. Speed
dependence is strong for electric-powered transit trains because wheel/rail
noise is the dominant noise source and noise from this type of source increases
strongly with speed. Diesel-powered commuter rail train noise is dominated by
the locomotive exhaust noise at slower speeds. As speed increases, wheel-rail

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 11

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

noise becomes the dominant noise source and diesel- and electric-powered
trains generate similar noise levels. Similarly, speed dependence is also strong
for automobiles, city buses (two-axle), and non-accelerating highway buses
(three-axle), because tire/pavement noise is the dominant noise source for
these vehicles. Accelerating highway bus noise is dominated by exhaust noise.

**Figure 3-2 Sound Level Dependence on Speed**

Sound levels close to the source are also dependent on vehicle acceleration,
vehicle length, running surface type, and running surface condition. For highspeed rail vehicles (vehicles with an operating speed of 90-250 mph are typically
beyond the scope of this manual), air turbulence can also be a source of noise.
In addition, for an elevated structure, the guideway can radiate noise as it
vibrates in response to the dynamic loading of the moving vehicle.

**Stationary Transit Vehicles**
Noise can be generated by transit vehicles even when they are stationary. For
example, auxiliary equipment such as cooling fans on motors, radiator fans, plus
hydraulic, pneumatic, and air-conditioning pumps, often continue to run when
vehicles are stationary. Transit buses are also often left idling in stations or
storage yards.

**Fixed-transit Facilities**
Noise can also be generated by sources at fixed-transit facilities. Such sources
include ventilation fans in transit stations, subway tunnels, and electric power
substations, as well as equipment in chiller plants, and many activities within
maintenance facilities and shops.

**Common Noise Sources**
Table 3-2 summarizes common sources of transit noise by vehicle and facility

type.

3.3 Paths of Transit Noise from Source to

Receiver

This section contains a qualitative overview of noise-path characteristics from
source to receiver, including attenuation along these paths. Equations for
specific noise-level attenuations along source-receiver paths are included in
Sections 4.4 and 4.5.

Sound paths from source to receiver are predominantly through the air. Along
these paths, sound reduces with distance due to divergence,
absorption/diffusion, and shielding. These mechanisms of sound attenuation are
discussed below.

**Divergence**
Sound levels naturally attenuate with distance, as shown in Figure 3-3. The plot
shows attenuation at the receiver relative to the sound level 50 ft from the
source. This type of attenuation is called divergence and is dependent upon
source configuration (line or point source) or other source-emission
characteristics. Localized sources (point sources) grouped closely together
attenuate greatly with distance at a rate of approximately 6 dB per doubling of
distance. Examples of point sources include highway grade-crossing signals along
rail corridors, intercoms in maintenance yards and other closely grouped
sources of noise. Vehicles passing along a track or roadway forming a line are
called line sources. Line sources attenuate less than point sources with distance.
Rate of attenuation for line sources varies depending on the noise metric. L eq(1hr)
and L dn noise levels attenuate at a rate of 3 dB per doubling of distance and L max
noise levels attenuate at a rate of 3 to 6 dBs per doubling of distance.

Figure 3-3 illustrates approximate attenuation with distance between the source
and receiver for point and line sources. The line source curve for the L max noise

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 14

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

metric separates into three curves because it is dependent on the length of the
line source. Equations for the curves in Figure 3-3 are included in Section 4.5.

**Figure 3-3 Attenuation Due to Distance (Divergence)**

**Absorption/Diffusion**
In addition to distance, sound levels can be attenuated depending on the type of
ground between the source and receiver. A portion of the sound energy is
absorbed by the ground and only the remaining energy travels to the source.
How much energy the ground absorbs is dependent on the ground type
(characterized as acoustically “hard” or “soft”) and geometry. Example
absorptive ground types include freshly-plowed or vegetation-covered ground.
Figure 3-4 illustrates approximate attenuation due to ground type by source to
receiver path distance and height. Ground attenuation can be as large as 5 dB
over a path distance of several hundred ft. At very large distances, wind and
temperature gradients could modify the expected ground attenuation. However,
these variable atmospheric effects are not included in this manual because they
generally occur beyond the range of typical transit-noise impact. Equations for
the curves in this figure are included in Section 4.5.

**Figure 3-4 Attenuation due to Soft Ground**

**Shielding**
Sound paths are sometimes interrupted by terrain, human-constructed noise
barriers, rows of buildings, or other objects. Noise barriers are one of the most
effective means of mitigating noise (Section 4.5, Step 7). A noise barrier reduces
sound levels at a receiver by breaking the direct line-of-sight between source
and receiver with a solid wall (in contrast to vegetation which hides the source
from view but does not reduce sound levels substantially over short distances).
Sound energy reaches the receiver only by bending (diffracting) over the top of

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 15

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

the barrier, as shown in Figure 3-5. This diffraction over the barrier reduces the
sound level that reaches the receiver. One important consideration in using
noise barriers to mitigate noise impacts is safety. Noise barriers, if not designed
and sited carefully, can reduce visibility of trains for pedestrians and motorists,
leading to less safe conditions. It is important to consult with safety experts
when choosing and siting a noise barrier.

Noise barriers for transportation systems are typically used to attenuate noise
at the receiver, potentially reducing received sound levels by 5 to 15 dB,
depending upon barrier height, length, and distance from both source and
receiver. Barriers on structures close to the transportation noise source may
provide less attenuation than barriers located farther from the source due to
reverberation (multiple reflections) between the barrier and the body of the
vehicle or noise source. This reverberation can be offset by increased barrier
height and/or acoustical absorption on the source side of the barrier. Further
discussion and equations on acoustical absorption and barrier attenuation is
provided in Section 4.5.

Source-to-receiver sound paths may not always travel through the air, but
rather through the ground or through structural components of the receiver's
building. Discussion of such ground-borne and structure-borne propagation is
included in Section 5.

**Figure 3-5 Noise Barrier Geometry**

3.4 Receiver Response to Transit Noise

This section contains an overview of human receiver response to noise. It
serves as background information for the noise impact criteria in Section 4.1.

Noise can interrupt ongoing activities causing community annoyance, especially
in residential areas. In general, most residents become highly annoyed when
noise interferes considerably with activities such as sleeping, talking, noisesensitive work, and audio entertainment. In addition, some land uses, such as
outdoor concert pavilions, are inherently incompatible with high noise levels.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 16

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

Annoyance from noise has been investigated and approximate dose-response
relationships have been quantified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA). [(5) ] The selection of noise metrics in this manual is largely based upon this
EPA work. Beginning in the 1970s, the EPA undertook a number of research and
synthesis studies relating to community noise of all types. Results of these
studies have been widely published, discussed, and refereed by many
professionals in acoustics. Basic conclusions of these studies have been adopted
by the Federal Interagency Committee on Noise (FICON), [(ii) ] the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the American
National Standards Institute, and even internationally [(6)(7)(8)(9). ] Conclusions from
this seminal EPA work remain scientifically relevant today.

Figure 3-6 contains a synthesis of actual case studies of community reaction to
newly introduced sources of noise in a residential urban neighborhood. [(10) ]
Plotted horizontally in the figure is the increase in noise from new sources
above existing noise levels expressed as Day-Night Sound Levels, L dn, discussed
in Appendix B.1.4.5. Plotted vertically is the community reaction to this newly
introduced noise. As shown in the figure, community reaction varies from no
reaction to vigorous action for newly introduced noises averaging from 10 dB
below existing to 25 dB above existing. Note the assumptions included in the
graphic are associated with the specific data points from the study. These
assumptions are generally appropriate to give context to most transit projects,
but community reaction may differ for conditions specific to each project.

In many community attitudinal surveys, transportation noise has been ranked
among the greatest causes of community dissatisfaction. A synthesis of many
such surveys on annoyance is shown in Figure 3-7. [(11)(12) ] Noise exposure levels
are plotted against the percentage of people who are highly annoyed by the
particular level of neighborhood noise. As shown in the figure, the percentage of
high annoyance is approximately 0 percent at 45 dB, 10 percent around 60 dB,
and increases quite rapidly to approximately 70 percent around 85 dB. The
scatter about the synthesis line is due to community variation and wording
differences in the surveys. An update of the original research containing
additional railroad, transit and street traffic noise surveys generally follows the
shape of the original response curve shown in Figure 3-7. [(12)(13) ]

As indicated by Figure 3-6 and Figure 3-7, introduction of certain levels of
transit noise into a community may have two undesirable effects. First, it may
substantially increase noise levels above existing noise levels in a community.
This effect is called a relative noise impact. Evaluation of this effect compares
new noise levels to the existing levels. Criteria for a relative noise impact
evaluation are based upon noise increases above existing levels. Second, newly
introduced transit noise may interfere with community activities independent of
existing noise levels. For example, it may be too loud to converse or sleep. This
effect is called absolute noise impact and is expressed as a fixed level threshold
that is not to be exceeded. The fixed level threshold is determined
independently of existing noise levels. Relative and absolute noise impacts are
discussed in terms of transit noise criteria in Section 4.1, Step 3.

Noise Impact Analysis

The FTA noise impact analysis process is a multi-step process used to evaluate
the project for potential noise impacts for FTA NEPA approvals. If impact is
determined, measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts must be
considered for incorporation into the project. [(4) ] It is recommended that project
sponsors develop and formally adopt a policy for determining the need for
mitigation for situations that are loosely covered by the impact criteria.
Considerations for mitigation policies are included in Section 2.3. The FTA noise
impact analysis steps are summarized as follows and are described in the
subsequent subsections:

**4.1:** Determine noise impact criteria.
**Step 1:** Identify the type of project/dominant noise source (transit or
multimodal).
**Step 2:** Choose land use category for FTA criteria.

**4.2:** Determine the highest appropriate level of noise analysis for the current
stage of project planning or development.

**4.3:** Evaluate for the potential of impact according to the Noise Screening
Procedure.

**Step 1:** Identify project type.
**Step 2:** Determine the screening distance.
**Step 3:** Identify the study area.
**Step 4:** Locate noise-sensitive land uses.

**4.4:** Evaluate impact according to the General Noise Assessment and evaluate
preliminary mitigation options if impact is found.
**Step 1:** Identify noise-sensitive receivers.
**Step 2:** Determine the project noise source reference levels.
**Step 3:** Estimate project noise exposure by distance.
**Step 4:** Combine noise exposure from all sources.
**Step 5** :Measure existing noise exposure.
**Step 6:** Inventory noise impacts.
**Step 7:** Determine noise mitigation needs.

**4.5:** Evaluate for impact according to the Detailed Noise Analysis and evaluate
mitigation options if impact is found.
**Step 1:** Identify noise-sensitive receivers.
**Step 2:** Determine noise source levels for detailed analysis.
**Step 3:** Calculate project noise exposure by distance.
**Step 4:** Combine noise exposure from all sources.
**Step 5:** Determine existing noise exposure.
**Step 6:** Assess noise impact.
**Step 7:** Determine noise mitigation measures.

In addition to analyzing for potential noise impacts, analyze the project for
potential vibration impacts according to the process presented in Section 6.
After both the noise and vibration analyses have been completed, assess

construction noise and vibration according to Section 7 and document findings
according to Section 8.

4.1 Determine Noise Impact Criteria

This section describes the procedure for determining the appropriate criteria
for assessing project noise impact based on the type of project and project
noise source. Project noise is the new noise or change in noise introduced by
the project. Noise impact criteria may vary for different segments of the
project. Project segments can be portions of a project with similar
characteristics.

The procedure to determine the appropriate impact criteria is described in this
section and shown more simply as a flow chart in Figure 4-1. If there is
uncertainty in how to determine the appropriate criteria, contact the FTA
Regional office.

The selected criteria are used in the analysis procedures discussed in Sections
4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 to identify potential impacts and the level of impact.

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Step 1: Identify Project Type**

_Identify the type of project as transit, multimodal (transit and highway), or other_
_multimodal according to the dominant noise source._

**Option A: Transit Project (Transit Noise Only)-** The transit project
category includes all transit projects where the project noise is exclusively due
to new transit sources, no changes are made to the highway or to existing
highway noise barriers, and the existing noise levels generated by roadway
sources will not change because of the project. For these transit projects, FTA
is the lead agency conducting the environmental review in cooperation with the
transit agency.

Typical examples of transit projects include:

 - RRT, LRT, commuter rail, and AGT

 - Rail projects built within an existing highway or railroad corridor that
do not alter the existing noise levels generated by roadway sources

 - Bus facility projects with operations on local streets and highways used
to access the facility, where the project does not include roadway
construction or modification that changes roadway capacity substantially

 - Fixed facilities including storage and maintenance yards, passenger
stations and terminals, parking facilities, and substations

 - Portions of transit projects not adjacent to highway corridors

_FTA impact criteria are appropriate for transit projects, proceed to Step 2._

**Option B: Multimodal Project (Transit and Highway Noise)-** Inthis
manual, “multimodal” refers to projects that include changes to both transit and
highway components, resulting in project noise comprised of both highway and
transit noise sources.

Typical examples of multimodal projects include:

 - New highway construction providing general-purpose lanes as well as
dedicated bus and high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes

 - Rail transit projects that involve changes to the highway travel lanes or
existing highway noise barriers

Evaluate multimodal projects for impact according to the project noise source
by project segment. FHWA’s noise assessment methods are used to inform
FTA’s NEPA evaluation only for segments where highway noise levels change
due to the transit project. These projects are not necessarily subject to
FHWA’s procedures at 23 CFR part 772 _(see call out box below_ ). For segments of
the project outside the highway corridor, use FTA’s criteria and methods. Use
Table 4-1 to determine multimodal project noise.

Once the project noise source(s) is identified **,** determine the appropriate
assessment method according to Table 4-2.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 21

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

Note that a separate noise analysis may be required for FHWA approval of a multimodal project
pursuant to 23 CFR part 772. For these projects, it is important to work with FHWA early in
the environmental review process to determine how a noise assessment will be completed
where FHWA approval is needed for the project.

The determination of whether a project is subject to FHWA procedures at 23 CFR part 772
depends upon the specific circumstances of a project. A proposed transit project that would
share an existing highway ROW is not necessarily a FHWA-defined multimodal project. A transit
project that meets all three of the following criteria is not considered a multimodal project
subject to 23 CFR part 772:

 - FTA is the lead agency in the NEPA process and FHWA's limited participation is as a
cooperating agency.

 - The main transportation purpose of the project, as stated in the purpose and need
statement of the environmental document, is transit-related and not highway-related.

 - No Federal-aid highway funds are being used to fund the project.

- L eq(1hr) for the loudest hour of project-related activity during hours of noise sensitivity.

Noise-sensitive land use categories are described in in order of sensitivity. Most
commercial or industrial uses are not considered noise-sensitive because

activities within these buildings are generally compatible with higher noise levels.
Business can be considered noise-sensitive if low noise levels are an important
part of operations, such as sound and motion picture recording studios.

For residential land use (category 2), apply the noise criteria at the nearest
façade of the occupied portion of the building, e.g., not at a garage or porch.
The residential criteria should be applied at locations with nighttime sensitivity.
For major noise-sensitive outdoor use at non-residential locations, apply the
noise criteria at the point of noise-sensitive use nearest the noise source.

Land use categories are evaluated using noise metrics that reflect the noisesensitive time of day:

 - **Categories1and3** - The noise metric, L eq(1hr) is used for all category 1
and 3 land uses where nighttime sensitivity is not a factor. Category 3
land uses are considered less noise-sensitive than category 1 land uses.
For transit analyses, L eq(1hr) is computed for the noisiest hour of transit

related activity during which human activities occur at the noisesensitive location. See Appendix B.1.4.4 for more information on this
metric.

 - **Category 2** - The noise metric L dn is a used for all category 2 land uses
where nighttime sensitivity is a factor. This noise metric includes a 10­
dB penalty for nighttime noise. See Appendix B.1.4.5 for more
information on this metric.

**Land Use Categories: Special Cases**

Historic sites, parks, indoor-only land use, and undeveloped land require special
consideration. In addition to NEPA, noise impacts may need to be considered
under other environmental laws such as Section 106 [(15) ] or Section 4(f). [(16) ]
Indoor-only use and undeveloped land should be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis to determine noise sensitivity based on how each facility is used or the
reason it is protected under the applicable requirement.

**Historic Sites** - Section 106 requires Federal agencies to evaluate potential
[effects from projects on historic properties. Per the regulations at 36 CFR part](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title36/36cfr800_main_02.tpl)
800, [(17) ] historic properties are defined as any prehistoric or historic district, site,
building, structure, or object included in, or eligible for the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP). An adverse effect determination under Section 106 is
made when a project may alter, directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics
of a historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in the National
Register in a manner that would diminish the integrity of the property’s location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association.

Under FTA environmental reviews, some structures may be evaluated as noisesensitive resources per this noise manual and evaluated as historic properties
under Section 106. However, because this manual and Section 106 regulations
have different criteria for effect, identifying a severe noise impact for a structure
under this manual does not necessarily mean there would be an adverse effect
under Section 106. It is important to thoroughly document the characteristics of
historic properties that qualify for inclusion in the NRHP for evaluation of effect
under Section 106.

If a property, for example, is listed on the NRHP under criterion C because the
structure possesses high artistic values, but lacks integrity of setting, feeling, or
association, it is unlikely that a change in the noise environment would affect the
features that qualify the property for listing or eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP.

In the assessment of effects on historic properties, consideration should be
given to not just the proposed transit project, but any associated mitigation
measures with the transit project. For example, if a transit project would
involve noise walls or berms as mitigation, the effect of those structures on the
visual setting may need to be considered in a Section 106 analysis.

**Parks** - Most parks used primarily for active recreation such as sports
complexes and bike or running paths are not considered noise-sensitive.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 24

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

However, some parks (even some in dense urban areas) are primarily used for
passive recreation such as reading, conversation, or meditation. These places,
which may be valued as havens from the noise and rapid pace of everyday city
life, are treated as noise-sensitive, and are included in land use category 3.
Consult the state or local agency with jurisdiction over the park on questions
about how the park is used, and visit the park to observe its use, if possible.

**Indoor-Only Use** - The land use categories described in this section
correspond with noise impact criteria that provide protection for both outdoor
and indoor land uses. For locations where noise impact will be evaluated but
there is no outdoor land use such as apartment buildings, hotels or upper levels
of multi-story buildings, indoor criteria can be used. In these cases, the criterion
for indoor noise levels from project sources is a L dn of 45 dBA. [(18) ] This criterion
is consistent with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). See Section 4.5 for
more information on how indoor criteria apply to noise mitigation
consideration.

**Undeveloped Land-** Undeveloped land may also need to be considered for
noise impact assessment and mitigation if plans are under way to develop the
land for noise-sensitive use. The policy for considering such land for assessment
and mitigation should be determined on a project-specific basis by the project
sponsor in consultation with the FTA Regional office.

**Step 3: Determine Appropriate FTA Criteria Presentation**

FTA criteria for noise impact were developed specifically for transit noise
sources operating on fixed-guideways or at fixed facilities in urban areas. These
criteria are based on well-documented research on human response to
community noise and represent a reasonable balance between community
benefit and project costs. These criteria do not reflect specific community
attitudinal factors. See Appendix C for additional background information on the
development of FTA noise criteria.

The criteria specify a comparison of future project noise with existing noise.
Note that projections of future noise exposure without the project (no-build
scenario) are not included in this analysis. The criteria also consider land use
which is an important factor that reflects noise sensitivity based on activity and
time period of concern. The criteria are defined with the expectation that
communities already exposed to high levels of noise can only tolerate a small
increase. In contrast, if the existing noise levels are low, it is reasonable to allow
a greater change in the community noise.

The levels of impact are described in Table 4-4. The criteria at which the levels
of impact occur are presented in two ways depending on the relationship of
project and existing noise sources.

_If the project noise source is a new source of transit noise in the community, such as a_
_new project in an area currently without transit, use the criteria as presented in Option_
_A. If the project noise adds to or changes existing transit noise in the community, use_
_the criteria as presented in Option B._

**Table 4-4 Levels of Impact**

|Level of Impact|Description|
|---|---|
|<br><br>~~No Impact~~<br>|<br> <br> <br><br>~~Project-generated noise is not likely to cause community annoyance. Noise~~<br>projections in this range are considered acceptable by FTA and mitigation is<br>not required.<br>|
|<br><br>~~Moderate Impact~~<br>|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>~~Project-generated noise in this range is considered to cause impact at the~~<br>threshold of measurable annoyance. Moderate impacts serve as an alert to<br>project planners for potential adverse impacts and complaints from the<br>community. Mitigation should be considered at this level of impact based on<br>project specifics and details concerning the affected properties.<br>|
|<br>~~Severe Impact~~|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>~~Project-generated noise in this range is likely to cause a high level of~~<br>community annoyance. The project sponsor should first evaluate alternative<br>locations/alignments to determine whether it is feasible to avoid severe impacts<br>altogether. In densely populated urban areas, evaluation of alternative locations<br>may reveal a trade-off of affected groups, particularly for surface rail<br>alignments. Projects that are characterized as point sources rather than line<br>sources often present greater opportunity for selecting alternative sites. This<br>guidance manual and FTA's environmental impact regulations both encourage<br>project sites which are compatible with surrounding development when<br>possible. If it is not practical to avoid severe impacts by changing the location of<br>the project, mitigation measures must be considered.|

**Option A: Project Noise Impact Criteria Presentation-** The impact
criteria presentation for evaluating existing noise independently to project noise
is presented in this option.

The noise levels at which impacts occur are presented in Figure 4-2 and Table
4-5. Equations for the impact criteria are presented in Appendix C. If impact is
determined, measures necessary to mitigate impacts are to be considered for
incorporation into the project. [(3) ]

Figure 4-2 presents the existing noise exposure on the horizontal axis and
project noise on the vertical axis. Category 1 and 2 land uses have the same
criteria for project noise and are on the primary vertical axis. Category 3 land
use criteria are presented on the secondary vertical axis. Note that project
noise for category 1 and 3 land uses is expressed as L eq(1hr ), whereas project
noise for category 2 land use is expressed as L dn . Also, note that project noise
criteria are 5 dB higher for category 3 land uses in Figure 4-2 since these types
of land use are less noise-sensitive than those in categories 1 and 2.

Note that for projects in locations with existing noise levels below 55 dBA, the
project noise exposure is allowed some increase over the existing noise
exposure before it is considered to cause impact. For category 1 and 2 land
uses, the maximum project noise level to be considered to cause no impact is
65 dBA (L eq(1hr ) or L dn ) regardless of the existing noise. Note that no impact at
65 dBA aligns with other Federal agencies in that a L dn of 65 dBA is a standard
limit for an acceptable living environment among some Federal agencies. [(19) (20) ]
Project noise levels above the top curve are considered to cause severe impact.
The upper limit of the severe impact range is 75 dBA for category 1 and 2 land
uses. The upper limit of 75 dBA is associated with an unacceptable living
environment. Project noise between the two curves is considered to have
moderate impact on the community.

correspond with this figure in Appendix C are the precise definition of the
criteria. The values in Table 4-5 can be used for illustrative purposes and should

**Option B: Cumulative Noise Impact Criteria Presentation**
_The impact criteria presentation for evaluating existing noise to project noise_
_cumulatively is presented in this option._

In certain cases, the cumulative form of the noise criteria shown in Figure 4-3
can be used. These cases involve projects where changes are proposed to an
existing transit system, as opposed to a new project in an area previously
without transit. Such changes might include operations of a new type of vehicle,
modifications of track alignments within existing transit corridors, or changes in
facilities that dominate existing noise levels. In these cases, the existing noise

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 28

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

sources change because of the project, and so it is not possible to define project
noise separately from existing noise. An example would be a commuter rail
corridor where the existing noise along the alignment is dominated by diesel
locomotive-hauled trains, and where the project involves electrification with the
resulting replacement of some of the diesel-powered locomotives with electric
trains operating at increased frequency of service and higher speeds on the
same tracks. In this case, the existing noise can be determined and a new future
noise can be calculated, but it is not possible to describe what constitutes the
“project noise.” For example, if the existing noise dominated by trains was
measured to be an L dn of 63 dBA at a particular location, and the new
combination of diesel and electric trains is projected to be an L dn of 65 dBA, the
change in the noise exposure due to the project would be 2 dB. Referring to
Figure 4-3, a 2-dB increase with an existing noise exposure of 63 dBA would be
rated as a moderate impact. Normally the project noise is added to the existing
noise to come up with a new cumulative noise, but in this case, the existing
noise was dominated by a source that changed due to the project, so it would
be incorrect to add the project noise to the existing noise. Consequently, the
existing noise determined by measurement is compared with a new calculated
future noise, but a description of what constitutes the actual project is complex.

Another example would be a rail corridor where a track is added and grade
crossings are closed, potentially resulting in a change in train location and horn
operation. Here the “project noise” results from moving some trains closer to
some receivers, away from others, and elimination of horns. In this case, the
change in noise level is more readily determined than the noise from the actual
project elements. In all cases, Figures 4-3 and 4-4 for changes in a transit system
results in the same assessment of impact as Figure 4-2 for development of
transit facilities in a new area.

The noise impact criteria in Figure 4-3 and Figure 4-4 are presented as an
increase in cumulative noise level between the existing and project conditions.
The horizontal axis represents the existing noise exposure and the vertical axis
is the increase in cumulative noise level due to the transit project. Note that
noise exposure is expressed as L eq(1hr) for category 1 and 3 land uses and L dn for
category 2 land use. Since L eq(1hr) and L dn are measures of total acoustic energy,
any new noise sources in a community will cause an increase, even if the new
source level is the same or less than the existing noise level (refer to decibel
addition in Appendix B). As shown in Figure 4-3, the criterion for moderate
impact is a noise exposure increase of 10 dB for an existing noise exposure level
of 42 dBA or less, but only a 1-dB increase when the existing noise exposure is
70 dBA.

As the existing level of ambient noise increases, the allowable level of transit
noise increases, but the total amount that community noise exposure is allowed
to increase is reduced. This accounts for the unexpected result that a project
exposure which is less than the existing noise exposure can still cause impact.
This is clearer from the examples listed in Table 4-6 which indicate the level of
transit noise allowed for different existing levels of exposure. Any increase
greater than shown in the table will cause moderate impact.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 29

**Figure 4-3 Increase in Cumulative Noise Levels Allowed by Criteria**
**(Land Use Cat. 1&2)**

**Figure 4-4 Increase in Cumulative Noise Levels Allowed by Criteria**
**(Land Use Cat. 3)**

This table shows that as the existing noise exposure increases from 45 dBA to
75 dBA, the allowed project noise exposure increases from 51 dBA to 65 dBA.
However, the allowed increase in the cumulative noise level decreases from 7
dB to 0 dB (rounded to the nearest whole decibel). The justification for this is
that people already exposed to high levels of noise should be expected to
tolerate only a small increase in the amount of noise in their community. In
contrast, if the existing noise levels are quite low, it is reasonable to allow a
greater change in the community noise for the equivalent difference in

annoyance.

4.2 Determine Noise Analysis Level

There are three levels of analysis to evaluate noise on a transit project based on
the type and scale of the project, stage of project development, and
environmental setting. These levels, described below, are the Noise Screening
Procedure, the General Noise Assessment and the Detailed Noise Analysis.

The Noise Screening Procedure, conducted first, defines the study area of any
subsequent noise impact assessment. Where there is potential for noise impact,
the General Noise Assessment and Detailed Noise Analysis procedures are
used to determine the extent and severity of impact. In some cases, a General
Noise Assessment may be all that is needed. However, if the proposed project
is near noise-sensitive land uses, and it appears at the outset that the impact
would be substantial, it is prudent to conduct a Detailed Noise Analysis.

_Conduct the noise screening procedure and then determine the appropriate noise_
_analysis option._

**Noise Screening Procedure** - The Noise Screening Procedure is a simplified
method of identifying study area receivers or locations where a project may
have the potential for noise impacts from transit projects. This procedure
accounts for impact criteria, the type of project, and noise-sensitive land uses. If
no noise-sensitive land uses or receivers are present in the analysis area, then
no further noise assessment is needed. If noise-sensitive receivers are identified,
then proceed to conduct a General Assessment and/or a Detailed Assessment.

The Noise Screening Procedure steps are provided in Section 4.3.

**General Noise Assessment** - The General Noise Assessment is used to

examine potentially impacted areas identified in the screening step by examining
the location and estimated severity of noise impacts. This procedure considers
noise source and land use information likely to be available at an early stage in
the project development process. Estimates are made of project noise levels
and of existing noise conditions to model the location of a noise impact contour

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 31

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

that defines the outer limit of an impact corridor or area. This modeling method
uses transit-specific noise and adjustment data (in tabular and graphical form) for
the noise computations.

For many smaller projects, this assessment may be sufficient to define impacts
and determine whether noise mitigation is necessary. The procedure can be
used in conjunction with established highway noise prediction procedures to
compare highway, transit, and multimodal alternatives. If an assessment is
needed to inform the decision on transit mode and general alignment in a
corridor, the General Noise Assessment procedures should be used, and not
the Detailed Noise Analysis, which requires more detailed information.

The General Noise Assessment procedure is provided in Section 4.4. FTA has
also developed an Excel spreadsheet to more simply conduct the General Noise
[Assessment. It is on FTA’s website at http://www.fta.dot.gov/12347_2233.html.](http://www.fta.dot.gov/12347_2233.html)

**Detailed Noise Analysis** - The Detailed Noise Analysis procedure is a
comprehensive assessment method that produces the most accurate estimates
of noise impacts for a proposed project. It is important to recognize that use of
the Detailed Noise Analysis methods will not provide more accurate results
than the General Noise Assessment unless more detailed and case-specific input
data are used.

The project must be defined to the extent that location, alignment, transit
mode, hourly operational schedules during day and night, speed profiles, plan
and profiles of guideways, locations of access roads, and landform topography
(including terrain and building features) are determined. A detailed Noise
Analysis is often accomplished at the development of the final environmental
impact statement (FEIS), record of decision (ROD), or combined FEIS/ROD in
the NEPA process, when the preferred alternative is undergoing refinements to
mitigate its adverse impacts. However, these project details may not be available
until the final design phase, requiring that the detail noise analysis be conducted
after the NEPA process is complete. However, it is recommended that the
detailed analysis be conducted earlier for controversial projects or projects with
highly noise-sensitive sites close to tracks.

A Detailed Noise Analysis may be warranted as part of the development of an
environmental assessment (EA) if there are potentially severe impacts due to
the proximity of noise-sensitive land uses.

In some cases, decisions on appropriate noise mitigation measures can be made
based on the results of the General Noise Assessment. But if costly measures
may be needed, it is generally recommended that a Detailed Noise Analysis be
conducted to verify the need and design of the noise mitigation. The Detailed
Noise Analysis is always appropriate under two sets of circumstances:

 - For a major transit project with likely noise impacts after the preferred
alternative has been selected.

 - For any other transit project where potentially severe impacts are
identified at an early stage.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 32

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

Noise impacts may occur for relatively minor transit projects when the project
is near noise-sensitive sites, particularly residences. In this case, completing a
Detailed Noise Analysis is recommended. Some examples include:

 - A terminal or station sited adjacent to a residential neighborhood

 - A maintenance facility located near a school

 - A storage yard adjacent to residences

 - An electric substation located adjacent to a hospital

The Detailed Noise Analysis procedure is provided in Section 4.5.

4.3 Evaluate Impact: Noise Screening Procedure

_Identify the potential for impact using the Noise Screening Procedure described below._

**Step 1: Identify Project Type**

_Identify the project type using Table 4-7 and confirm the assumptions in Table 4-8_
_are appropriate for the project._

The noise screening procedure is intended to be conservative to broadly
capture the potential for impact with minimal effort. To make the procedure
conservative, the project system must be assumed to be operating under
relatively high-capacity conditions, which would produce more noise than
normal operating conditions. In addition, the assumptions in Table 4-8 were
made using the lowest threshold of impact (50 dBA) from the criteria curves in
Figure 4-2. Clarification can be obtained from FTA on special cases that are not
represented in this section.

If the assumptions in Table 4-8 are not appropriate for the project, make
adjustments to the screening distances in Table 4-8 according to the
methodology in Section 4.4 or the FTA spreadsheet model.

**Step 2: Determine the Screening Distance**

_Determine the appropriate screening distance considering the type of project and_
_shielding from intervening buildings._

**2a.** Determine the appropriate screening distance column in Table 4-7.

**Option A:Buildings in the Sound Paths-** Use the screening distances
in the “Intervening Buildings” column.

**Option B:Buildings Not in the Sound Paths-** Use the distances in
the “Unobstructed” column.

**2b.** Adjust these distances according to the methodology in Section 4.4, or the
FTA spreadsheet model, if the assumptions in Table 4-8 are not appropriate for
the project. The appropriate screening distance is where the project noise
reaches 50 dBA for the appropriate metric. If the assumptions in Table 4-8 are
not appropriate for a commuter rail grade crossing project where horns and

warning bells are used, use the FRA horn noise model available from the FRA
[website to develop the screening distance distance (49 CFR § 222).](https://www.fra.dot.gov/eLib/Details/L04091) [(21) ]

**Step 3: Identify Study Area**

_Apply the screening distances as follows to identify the study area. The study area is_
_intended to be sufficiently large to encompass all potentially impacted locations._

**Option A: Fixed Guideway Transit Sources -** Apply the screening distance
from the guideway centerline.

**Option B: Highway/Transit Sources (e.g., Bus)-** Apply the screening
distance from the nearest ROW line on both sides of a highway or access road.

**Option C: Small Stationary Facilities-** Apply the screening distance from
the center of the noise-generating activity.

**Option D: Stationary Facility Spread Over a Large Area-** Apply the
screening distance from the outer boundary of the proposed project site.

**Step 4: Locate Noise-Sensitive Land Uses**

_Locate all noise-sensitive land uses within the study area using Table 4-3._

See Section 4.1 for more information on noise-sensitive land uses. Include all
categories of noise-sensitive land uses in this step.

_**If no noise-sensitive land uses are identified, no further noise analysisis**_
_**needed.Ifone or more of the noise-sensitive land uses are in the study**_
_**area, proceed to Section 4.4 and complete a General Noise Assessment.**_

4.4 Evaluate Impact: General Noise Assessment

The General Noise Assessment should be completed after the Noise Screening
Procedure (Section 4.3), through which noise-sensitive receivers have been
identified. This can be completed either by using the General Noise Assessment
Procedure described below or using the FTA General Noise Assessment
Spreadsheet found on the following FTA website:
[http://www.fta.dot.gov/12347_2233.html.](http://www.fta.dot.gov/12347_2233.html)

Assumptions are used throughout the General Noise Assessment. If the listed
assumptions are not appropriate for the project and good engineering
judgement cannot be used by following the General Noise Assessment
procedure, proceed to a Detailed Noise Analysis or consult with the FTA
Regional office.

Major steps in the General Noise Assessment procedure and recommended
workflow are shown in Figure 4-5 and listed below. Four examples of General
Noise Assessments are given at the end of this section. Many of these concepts
are explained in greater detail in the context of a Detailed Noise Analysis in
Section 4.5.

**Step 1: Identify Noise-Sensitive Receivers-** Identify noise-sensitive
receivers (Section 4.3) and their proximity to the project and major noise

sources.

**Step 2: Determine Project Noise Source Reference Levels-** Determine
the project noise sources and reference levels. Then, estimate the project noise
exposure at the reference distance of 50 ft considering operational
characteristics with preliminary estimations of the effect of mitigation.

**Step 3: Estimate Project Noise Exposure by Distance -** Estimate project
noise exposure at distances beyond 50 ft considering propagation characteristics
using a simplified procedure.

**Step 4: Combine Noise Exposure from All Sources-** Combine all
sources associated with the project to predict the total project noise at the
receivers.

**Step 5: Measure Existing Noise Exposure-** Measure the existing noise or
estimate the existing noise exposure using a simplified procedure.

**Step 6: Inventory Impacts**

**Option A:** Tabulate the change in noise (existing vs. estimated project
noise) at each noise-sensitive receiver or cluster, identifying all moderate
and severe impacts.

**Option B:** Take inventory of noise-sensitive receivers that fall within the
moderate and severe noise contours.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 37

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Step 7: Determine Noise Mitigation Needs-** Evaluate the need for
mitigation and repeat the General Noise Assessment with proposed mitigation.

**Figure 4-5 Procedure for General Noise Assessment**

**Step 1: Identify Noise-Sensitive Receivers**

_Determine the proximity of noise-sensitive land uses identified in Section 4.3 to the_
_project and to the nearest major roadways and railroad lines._

**1a.** When necessary, use windshield surveys or detailed land use maps to
confirm the location of noise-sensitive land uses.

**1b.** For land uses more than 1,000 ft from major roadways or railroad
mainlines, obtain an estimate of the population density in the immediate
area, expressed in people per square mile. Distances to roadways or
railroads, or population density, will be used later to estimate the existing

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 38

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

noise level. Coordinate with the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO)
for population densities at an appropriate level of detail.

**Step 2: Determine Project Noise Source Reference Levels**

_Determine the general source reference level for each project noise source._

Classify all project noise sources as fixed-guideway transit, highway/transit, or
stationary facility and determine the source reference levels. Note that a major
fixed-guideway system will have stationary facilities associated with it and that a
stationary facility may have highway/transit elements associated with it.

**Option A: Fixed-guideway Transit Sources-** For this manual, fixed­
guideway transit sources include commuter rail, RRT, LRT, streetcar, AGT,
monorail, and magnetically levitated vehicles (maglev). For commuter railroads
and LRT systems, the crossing of streets and highways at-grade is likely, and in
that case, warning devices should be included in the assessment. At an early
project stage, the information available for a General Noise Assessment
includes:

 - Candidate transit mode

 - Guideway options

 - Time of operation

 - Operational headways

 - Design speed

 - Alternative alignments

This information is not sufficient to predict noise levels at all locations along the
ROW. Therefore, use conservative estimates (e.g., maximum (expected) design
speeds and operations at design capacities) to estimate worst-case noise levels.

First choose the appropriate fixed-guideway transit source reference level and
then predict the noise exposure at 50 ft in terms of L eq(1hr) and L dn .

**A.i.** Choose the reference source noise levels 50 ft from the track for one
vehicle in terms of Sound Exposure Level (SEL) using Table 4-9. See Appendix B
for a detailed explanation of SEL. Note that the SEL reference speed is 50 mph,
unless otherwise noted.

**A.ii.** Collect the following data:

 - Number of train passbys during the day (7 a.m. to 10 p.m.) and night (10
p.m. to 7 a.m.) for category 2 land uses

 - Maximum number of train passbys during hours that category 1 or
category 3 land uses are normally in use (typically the peak hour train
volume)

 - Number of vehicles per train for each time period for category 2 land
uses (if this number varies during the day or night, take the average)

 - Maximum number of vehicles per train during hours that category 1 or
category 3 land uses are normally in use (typically the peak hour train
volume)

 - Train speed in mph (maximum expected)

 - Guideway configuration

 - Location of highway and street grade crossings, if any

 - If this process is repeated to estimate the effect of proposed noise
mitigation, include the noise barrier location

**A.iii.** Calculate the noise exposure at 50 ft in terms of L eq(1hr) :

 - Calculate L eq(1hr) for each source using the appropriate equations in
Table 4-10.

 - Compute L eq(1hr).Combo using Eq. 4-6. It may be necessary to compute the
combined totals with and without warning horns. Some neighborhoods
along the corridor may be exposed to horn noise, but some may not.

**A.iv.** Calculate the noise exposure at 50 ft in terms of L dn :

 - If the project noise will affect any residential receivers, calculate the L dn
using the combined L eq(1hr) for both the daytime and nighttime periods
separately, using the appropriate equations in Table 4-10.

 - It may be necessary to calculate L dn with and without warning horns, as
in the previous step.

Note that the equations in Table 4-10 include terms to account for a
difference in speed from the 50 mph reference speed and a numerical
adjustment to account for the one-hour time period for this metric. For

of interest, see Appendix B.1.4.4.

Table 4-10 presents an estimate of the noise reduction potentially provided by
wayside noise barriers that can be used when assessing mitigation options in a
General Noise Assessment. If impact is determined during the General Noise
Assessment, repeat the procedure and include proposed mitigation according to
Section 4.4, Step 7. See Section 4.5, Step 7 for a complete description of the
benefits resulting from various noise mitigation measures that can be evaluated
with a Detailed Noise Analysis.

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Option B: Highway/Transit Sources-** The highway/transit type sources
include most transit modes that do not require a fixed-guideway. Examples are
high-occupancy vehicles, such as buses, commuter vanpools and carpools. Use
the instructions below to estimate source noise levels for projects that involve
these types of vehicles and are using FTA’s environmental review procedures.
At an early project stage, the information available for a General Noise
Assessment includes:

 - Vehicle type

 - Transitway design options

 - Time of operation

 - Typical headways

 - Design speed

 - Alternative alignments

This information is not sufficient to predict noise levels at all locations along the
ROW; therefore, use of conservative estimates (e.g., maximum (expected)
design speeds and operations at design capacities) to estimate worst-case noise
impact levels is recommended. The procedure is consistent with FHWA’s
highway noise prediction method. The reference SEL levels in Table 4-11
correspond to FHWA’s source emission levels and speed coefficients for buses
and automobiles. [(22) ]

**B.i.** Using Table 4-11, choose the appropriate reference source noise levels 50
ft from the roadway in terms of SEL. Note that the SEL reference speed is 50
mph, unless otherwise noted.

**Table 4-11 Source Reference Levels at 50 ft from Roadway, 50 mph**

|Source*|Reference SEL, dBA|
|---|---|
|<br> <br><br>~~Automobiles and Vans~~<br>|<br><br>~~74~~<br>|
|<br><br>~~Buses (diesel-powered)~~<br>|<br><br>~~82~~<br>|
|<br><br>~~Buses (electric)~~<br>|<br><br><br>~~80~~<br>|
|<br>~~Buses (hybrid)~~<br><br>|<br> <br>~~83**~~<br><br>|

 - Assumes normal roadway surface conditions.
** For hybrid buses, determine Reference SEL on a
case-by-case basis because they vary, and data are

scarce.

**B.ii.** Collect the following data:

 - Number of vehicle passbys during the day (7 a.m. to 10 p.m.) and night
(10 p.m. to 7 a.m.) for each vehicle type in Table 4-11, if a category 2
land use is present

 - Number of vehicle passbys during hours that category 1 or category 3
land uses are normally in use, each vehicle type in Table 4-11

 - Speed (maximum expected)

 - Transitway configuration (with or without noise barrier)

**B.iii.** Calculate the noise exposure at 50 ft in terms of L eq(1hr) . Calculate L eq(1hr)
for each source using the appropriate equations in Table 4-12.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 43

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**B.iv.** Calculate the noise exposure at 50 ft in terms of L dn . If the project noise
will affect any residential receivers, calculate the L dn using the combined L eq(1hr)
for both the daytime and nighttime periods separately, using the appropriate
equations in Table 4-12.

Note that the equations in Table 4-12 include terms to account for a speed
other than the 50 mph reference speed and a numerical adjustment to account
for the one-hour time period for this metric. For more information on the
numerical adjustment to represent the time period of interest, see Appendix
B.1.4.4.

Table 4-12 presents an estimate of noise reduction potentially provided by
wayside noise barriers. This is considered illustrative given that barriers are the
most common noise mitigation measure. See Section 4.5, Step 7 for a complete
description of the benefits resulting from noise mitigation. If impact is
determined during the General Noise Assessment without mitigation, repeat
the procedure and include proposed mitigation.

**Option C: Stationary Sources** - Stationary sources include fixed transit
system facilities. New transit facilities undergo a site review for best location
that considers the noise sensitivity of surrounding land uses. Although many
facilities such as bus maintenance garages are usually located in industrial and
commercial areas, some facilities such as bus terminals, ferry terminals, train
stations, and park-and-ride lots may be placed near residential neighborhoods
where noise impact may occur. Access roads to some of these facilities may also

pass through noise-sensitive areas. Noise from access roads is treated according
to the procedures described in the Highway/Transit Sources category. In a
General Noise Assessment, only the prominent features of each fixed facility are
considered in the noise analysis.

**C.i.** For small facilities, using Table 4-13, determine the reference source noise
levels 50 ft from the center of the site in terms of SEL. The source reference
levels given in the table are based on measurements for the peak hour of
operation of a typical stationary source of the noted type and size.

A large facility, such as a rail yard, is spread out over considerable area with
various noise sources with different noise levels depending on the layout of the
facility. Specifying a single reference SEL for the facility at 50 ft from the center
of the site could be misleading if all of these different noise sources are not
represented. Therefore, the reference distance should be the equivalent
distance of 50 ft, which is determined by estimating the noise levels from the
center of the site at a distance far enough to capture all noise sources and
projecting back to 50 ft from the center of the site. This approach allows for a
conservative estimate of noise for all surrounding areas and the equivalent noise
can be considered as concentrated at the center of the site. If the location of
noise sources is known, then the distance should be taken from the point of the
noisiest activity on the site (e.g., the dock in the case of ferry boat operations)
instead of the center of the site.

**C.iii.** Calculate L eq(1hr) at 50 ft. Calculate L eq(1hr) for each source using the
appropriate equations in Table 4-14.

**C.iv.** Calculate L dn at 50 ft. If the project noise will affect any residential
receivers, calculate the L dn using the combined L eq(1hr) for both the daytime and
nighttime periods separately, using the appropriate equations in Table 4-14.

The equations in Table 4-14 include a numerical adjustment to account for the
one-hour time period for this metric. See Appendix B.1.4.4 for more
information on the numerical adjustment.

Table 4-14 presents an estimate of noise reduction potentially provided by noise
barriers at the property line. Only approximate locations and lengths for barrier
or other noise mitigation measures are developed during a General Noise
Assessment to provide a preliminary indication of the costs and benefits of
mitigation. A Detailed Noise Analysis of the preferred alternative is usually
warranted following the General Noise Assessment (if it predicts any impacts)
to verify impacts and design the mitigation.

**Step 3: Estimate Project Noise Exposure by Distance**

_Estimate the project noise exposure for locations beyond the reference distance, such_
_as for noise-sensitive land uses._

In the previous step, noise exposure at the reference distance of 50 ft was
calculated for the various noise sources. This step describes how to estimate
the project noise exposure beyond (or, if needed, closer than) the reference
distance, such as at noise-sensitive land uses locations. This procedure estimates
the source’s noise exposure as a function of distance. Adjustments are provided
to account for shielding attenuation from rows of buildings.

**3a.** Select the appropriate distance correction curve (Fixed-Guideway &
Highway or Stationary) from Figure 4-6. The Fixed-Guideway & Highway curve
refers to line sources while the Stationary curve is refers to point sources. The
distance correction factor (C distance ) is 0 dB at 50 ft.

**3b.** Choose a distance other than 50 ft, such as the distance to a receiver.
Determine the correction factor using Figure 4-6 or calculate using the
equations in Table 4-15. [(iii) ] For distances beyond 1,000 ft, the equations in Table
4-15 can be used; however, ground effects have an upper limit and atmospheric
conditions may affect propagation characteristics. More detailed calculation
methods may be required to account for those effects beyond 1,000 ft.

**Figure 4-6 Curves for Estimating Exposure vs. Distance in General Noise Assessment**

iii Note that the curves and equations assume acoustically soft ground beyond a distance of 50 ft. See Table 4-27
for more detailed calculation of ground attenuation.

**3c.** Apply the distance correction (C distance ) to the project noise exposure at 50
ft (Section 4.4, Step 2) using the following equation:

where:

ഽ ෦෫෵෶෣෰෥෧ = ഽ ෦෰ or ഽ ෧ෳ(ൄ෪෴) at the new distance in feet
ഽ ൈൃ = ഽ ෦෰ or ഽ ෧ෳ(ൄ෪෴) at 50 ft

**Eq. 4-20**

**3d.** Repeat Step 3c for each source-receiver distance from the project. A noise
exposure vs. distance curve can be created, if desired, by calculating the noise
exposure for all distances of interest and plotting a curve. This curve can be
used to assist in determining the noise impact contour for the first row of
unobstructed buildings. This plot can be used to display noise from both
unmitigated and mitigated conditions to assess the potential benefits from
mitigation measures.

For second row receivers and beyond, it is necessary to account for shielding
attenuation from rows of intervening buildings. Without accounting for
shielding, impacts may be substantially overestimated. Use the following general
rules to account for the effect of shielding from intervening rows of buildings:

 - Assign 4.5 dB of shielding attenuation for the first row of intervening
buildings only.

 - Assign 1.5 dB of shielding attenuation for each subsequent row, up to a
maximum total attenuation of 10 dB.

**Step 4: Combine Noise Exposure from All Sources**

_Combine all sources to predict the total project noise at the receivers using the_
_equations in Table 4-16, once propagation adjustments have been made for the noise_
_exposure from each source separately (fixed-guideway, highway/transit, and_
_stationary)._

**Step 5: Estimate Existing Noise Exposure**

_Measure the existing noise or estimate the existing noise exposure using a simplified_
_procedure._

Existing noise in the project vicinity must be quantified and compared to the
project noise to determine the potential noise impact. It is generally
recommended to measure existing noise, especially at locations known to be
noise-sensitive, but if measurement results are not available then they must be
estimated. In the Detailed Noise Analysis, the existing noise exposure is usually
based on noise measurements at representative locations in the community.

It is not necessary or recommended that **Changes to Existing Transit**
existing noise exposure be determined by For projects that propose
measuring at every noise-sensitive changes to an existing transit
location in the project area. Rather, the system, such as a rehabilitation
recommended approach is to project, the project noise can
characterize the noise environment for include changes to the existing

Guidelines for selecting representative noise criteria.
receiver locations and determining
ambient noise are provided in Appendix D and Appendix E, respectively.

This section describes how to estimate the existing noise in the project study
area from general data available early in project planning. The procedure uses
Table 4-17, where a neighborhood's existing noise exposure is based on
proximity to nearby major roadways or railroads, or on population density. For
areas near major airports, published aircraft noise contours can also be used to
estimate the existing noise exposure. The process is as follows:

**5a.** Obtain scaled mapping and aerial photographs showing the project location
and alternatives. A scale of 1 inch = 200 or 400 ft is convenient for the accuracy
needed in the noise assessment. The size of the base map should be sufficient to
show distances of at least 1000 ft from the center of the alignment or property
center, depending on whether the project is a line source (fixed guideway/
roadway) or a stationary facility. These data are commonly available from local
transit agencies and a number of publicly available online tools.

**5b.** Estimate the existing noise exposure by estimating the noise from major
roads and railroad lines or by population density. First, evaluate the site's
proximity to major roads and railroad lines including those that are included in
the project. If these noise sources are far enough away that ambient noise is
dominated by local streets and community activities, estimate the existing noise
based on population density. To choose the appropriate existing noise
exposure, compare noise levels from each of the three categories--Roadways,
Railroads, and Population Density--and select the lowest level. In case of a

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 50

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

lightly used railroad (one train per day or less) select the Population Density
category. Existing noise levels are presented in Table 4-17. Refer to Section 4.1,
Step 3 - Option B, on using the cumulative noise criteria for projects that
propose changes to an existing transit system, such as a rehabilitation project.

**Option A: Roadways-** Major roadways are separated into two categories for
a general noise assessment. Roadways that cannot be described by these two
categories are not considered major roadways and would use the Population
Density method described below. The roadway categories are as follows:

 - Interstate highway--roadways with 4 or more lanes that allow trucks

 - Other roadway--parkways without trucks and city streets with the
equivalent of 75 or more heavy trucks per hour or 300 or more
medium trucks per hour

The estimated roadway noise levels in Table 4-17 are based on data for light to
moderate traffic on typical highways and parkways using FHWA highway noise
prediction procedures. Where a range of distances is given, the noise exposure
estimates are given at the larger distance (note that the traffic noise at the
smaller distance is underestimated). For highway noise, distances are measured
from the centerline of the near lane for roadways with two lanes, while for
roadways with more than two lanes the distance is measured from the
geometric mean of the roadway. This distance is computed as follows:

⁡ ⁡

⁡

വ ා෕ ⁡ ൛ ⁡ ~~√~~ (വ ූ )(വ ෎ )

⁡

⁡ ⁡

**Eq. 4-23**

⁡

⁡ ⁡

where:

വ ා෕ = distance to the geometric mean in feet

വ ූ = distance to the nearest lane centerline in feet

വ ෎ = distance to the farthest lane centerline in feet

**Option B: Railroad Lines -** For railroads, the estimated noise levels are
based on an average train traffic volume of 5-10 trains per day at 30-40 mph for
main line railroad corridors and the noise levels are provided in terms of L dn
only. Distances are referenced to the track centerline, or in the case of multiple
tracks, to the centerline of the rail corridor. Because of the intermittent nature
of train operations, train noise will affect the L eq(1hr) only during certain hours of
the day, and these hours may vary from day to day. Therefore, to avoid
underestimating noise impact when using L eq(1hr), it is recommended that sites
near rail lines are estimated based on nearby roadways or population density
unless very specific train information is available.

**Option C: Population Density-** Inareas away from major roadways, noise
from local streets or in neighborhoods is estimated using a relationship
determined during a research program by EPA. [(24) ] EPA determined that ambient
noise can be related to population density in locations away from transportation
corridors, such as airports, major roads and railroad tracks, according to the
following relation:

where:

൛ [= population density in people per square mile]

In areas near major airports, published noise contours can be used to estimate
the existing noise exposure. The L dn from such contours should be applied if
greater than the estimates of existing noise from other sources at a given
location.

_*****_ Distances do not include shielding from intervening rows of buildings. Generally, for estimating shielding
attenuation in populated areas, assume 1 row of buildings every 100 ft, 4.5 dB for the first row, and 1.5 dB for
every subsequent row up to a maximum of 10 dB attenuation.
****** Roadways with 4 or more lanes that permit trucks, with traffic at 60 mph.

**†** Parkways with traffic at 55 mph, but without trucks, and city streets with the equivalent of 75 or more heavy
trucks per hour and 300 or more medium trucks per hour at 30 mph.

**††** Main line railroad corridors typically carrying 5-10 trains per day at speeds of 30-40 mph.

**Step 6: Inventory Noise Impacts**

_Inventory the potential noise impacts either by comparing the project and existing noise_
_at each noise-sensitive land use or by developing noise impact contours._

Use land use information and assumptions for shielding attenuation from rows
of buildings. In some cases, it may be necessary to supplement the land use
information or determine the number of dwelling units within a multi-family
building with a visual survey. If the objective is to compare major alignment
options, it may not be necessary to identify every different type of noise

sensitive land use. The inventory may include a subset of land uses, including
residential and public institutional uses.

Option A is the preferred method as it quantifies the noise impact at each
noise-sensitive land use indicating the severity of the impact. Option B may be
useful for comparing and narrowing down major alignment options with
numerous noise-sensitive land uses.

**Option A: Compare existing noise to project noise at each noise-**
**sensitive land use.**

**A1.** Tabulate each individual noise-sensitive land use building and site within the
identified screening distance (Section 4.3).

**A2.** Determine for each noise-sensitive land use the existing noise (Section 4.4,
Step 5), the project noise (Section 4.4, Step 3) and the resulting change in noise.

**A3.** Designate each noise-sensitive land use with either a no, moderate, or
severe noise impact based on the criteria in Section 4.1.

**A4.** Identify all moderate and severe impacts on a project map.

**Option B: Develop noise impact contours.**

**B1.** Determine the noise level thresholds at which the project noise would
cause moderate and severe impacts using the estimated existing noise exposure
from Section 4.4, Step 5 and the noise impact criteria in Figure 4-2.

**B2.** Determine the distances from the project boundary to the two impact
levels using the noise exposure vs. distance curves or equations in Section 4.4,
Step 3.

**B3.** Plot points on a project land use map that correspond to the distances
determined in Section 4.4, Step 3. Continue this process for all areas
surrounding the project. Connect the plotted points to represent the noise
impact contours.

**B4.** Tabulate all noise-sensitive land use buildings and sites that lie between the
impact contours and the project boundary. For residential buildings, an estimate
of the number of dwelling units is satisfactory.

**B5.** Prepare summary tables showing the number of buildings (and estimated
dwelling units, if available) within both impact categories.

Specific decibel level noise contours, for example, 65 dBA, can also be plotted if
desired. The distances can be determined using the procedure in Section 4.4,
Step 3 by substituting the desired decibel level for the impact threshold.

Locations of points will change with respect to the project boundary as the
existing ambient exposure changes, the project source levels change, and as
shielding effects change. It is recommended to plot points close together to

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 53

draw a smooth curve. For a General Noise Assessment, the contours may be
drawn through buildings and terrain features as if they were not present. This
practice is acceptable considering the level of detail associated with a project in
its early stages of development. Example 4-1 and Example 4-4 describe the
development of noise contours with illustrations.

**Step 7: Determine Noise Mitigation Needs**

_Apply estimates of the noise reduction from proposed mitigation measures (Section_
_4.4, Step 2), where the assessment shows either severe or moderate impact, and_
_repeat the tabulation of noise impacts._

Note that noise barriers are the only form of mitigation available in a General
Noise Assessment. The other mitigation measures are available for a Detailed
Noise Analysis. The approximate noise barrier lengths and locations developed
in a General Noise Assessment provide a preliminary basis for evaluating the
costs and benefits of impact mitigation. This evaluation will provide a
conservative estimate of the effect of the mitigation on the identified impacts.

In general, it is recommended to complete a Detailed Noise Analysis for final
mitigation measures. However, if impact is identified through a General Noise
Assessment and can be mitigated to a level of no impact using the noise
reduction estimates included in the General Noise Assessment, a Detailed
Noise Analysis may not be needed. Mitigation assumed in the assessment used
for the NEPA evaluation must be included in the project as a commitment.
Consult with the FTA Regional office to determine if a Detailed Noise Analysis
is required for final mitigation measures.

The following examples illustrate how to complete general noise assessments
for varying project types including commuter rail, highway/transit, BRT system,
and a transit center.

4.5 Evaluate Impact: Detailed Noise Analysis

**Evaluate for impact using the Detailed Noise Analysis procedure in**
**this section, if appropriate.** For guidelines on when the Detailed Noise
Analysis is appropriate, review Section 4.2.

The steps in the Detailed Noise Analysis (Figure 4-9) parallel the steps in the
General Noise Assessment, though the Detailed Noise Analysis employs
equations for computations rather than graphs or tables. Each step in the
Detailed Noise Analysis is more refined in the prediction of project noise and
subsequent evaluation of mitigation measures. Noise projections from the
project must be determined for each receiver.

- **Step 1: Identify Noise-Sensitive Receivers**
Identify the noise-sensitive receivers of interest in the impact analysis study,
including clustering noise-sensitive areas. This identification is usually based

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 64

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

on the Screening Procedure and General Noise Assessment previously
conducted.

- **Step 2: Determine Project Noise Source Reference Levels**
Determine the project noise sources and reference levels. Then, estimate
the project noise exposure at the reference distance of 50 ft, considering
operational characteristics. When appropriate, measurements may be used
to determine noise source reference levels.

- **Step 3: Determine Propagation Characteristics**
Estimate project noise exposure as a function of distance, accounting for
shielding and propagation along the path.

- **Step 4: Combine Noise Exposure from All Sources**
Combine all sources to predict the total project noise at receivers.

- **Step 5: Determine Existing Noise Exposure**
Determine the existing noise exposure. Measurements are used to
determine the existing noise exposure. When measurements are
unavailable, a simplified procedure to estimate existing noise exposure may
be used with a clear justification to and approval by the FTA Regional office.

- **Step 6: Assess Noise Impact**
Assess the noise impact at each receiver of interest using separate
procedures for transit only and multimodal transportation projects.

- **Step 7: Determine Noise Mitigation Measures**
Evaluate the need for mitigation and repeat the Detailed Noise Analysis with
proposed mitigation.

When situations arise that are not explicitly covered in the Detailed Noise
Analysis, professional judgment, in consultation with the FTA Regional office,
may be used to extend these methods to cover these unique cases, when
appropriate. Appendix G provides information on developing and using non­
standard modeling procedures.

**Figure 4-9 Procedure for Detailed Noise Analysis**

**Step 1: Identify Noise-Sensitive Receivers**

_Select the noise-sensitive receivers of interest, the number of which will depend upon_
_the land use in the vicinity of the proposed project and the extent of the study area_
_defined by the Noise Screening Procedure in Section 4.3 and the results of the General_
_Noise Assessment in Section 4.4._

The steps in identifying the noise-sensitive receivers of interest, both the
number of receivers needed and their locations, shown in Figure 4-10, include:
**1a.** Identify all noise-sensitive land uses.
**1b.** Select individual receivers of interest.

**1c.** Cluster residential neighborhoods and other large noise-sensitive areas.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 66

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Figure 4-10 Guide to Selecting Noise-Sensitive Receivers of Interest**

**1a.** Identify all noise-sensitive land uses where impact is identified by the
General Noise Assessment in Section 4.4. If a General Noise Assessment has
not been done, include all noise-sensitive sites according to the Noise Screening
Procedure in Section 4.3. In areas where ambient noise is low, include land uses
that are farther from the proposed project than for areas with higher ambient
levels.

Recommended materials and methods that can assist in locating noise-sensitive
land uses near the proposed project include:

 - **Land use maps** prepared by regional or local planning agencies or by the
project staff. Area-wide maps often do not have sufficient detail to be of
much use. But they can provide broad guidance and may suggest residential
pockets hidden within otherwise commercial zones. Of more use are
project-specific maps that provide building-by-building detail on the land
near the proposed project.

 - **Road and town maps** can supplement other maps, are generally more up­
to-date, and may be of larger scale.

 - **Aerial photographs,** when current, especially those of 400-ft scale or
better, are valuable in locating all potential noise-sensitive land uses close to
the proposed project. In addition, they can be useful in determining the
distances between receivers and the project.

 - **Windshield survey,** in which the corridor is driven and land uses are
annotated on base maps, may be used for definitive identification of noisesensitive sites. The windshield survey, supplemented by footwork where
needed, is especially useful in identifying newly-constructed sites and in
confirming land uses very close to the proposed project. In addition, maps
and aerial photos typically reveal only horizontal distances, not vertical
distances. Houses on a hill overlooking the project may need a barrier of
unacceptable height for its attenuation to be effective, and the greater
vertical distance between source and receiver may eliminate the impact
entirely. The windshield survey would reveal where vertical contour maps

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 67

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

or other means may be needed so that vertical distances can be
determined **.**

- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** provides electronic mapping
needed for identifying noise-sensitive land uses. GIS data may include land
parcels, building structures, aerial photography, and project-specific
information. These data may be obtained during the project study or from
local or regional agencies that store and maintain GIS data. Using electronic
GIS data has advantages over paper mapping with respect to automating the
process of identifying noise-sensitive land uses and accurately being able to
determine their distances to the project alignment

Table 4-18 contains three types of _land uses of interest_ and provides guidelines as
to when receivers should be analyzed individually and when they can be
clustered.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 68

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**1b.** Select the following types of noise-sensitive receivers within the noise study
area, per Table 4-18, to be evaluated as individual receivers:

 - Every major noise-sensitive public building

 - Every isolated residence

 - Every relatively small outdoor noise-sensitive area

Use judgment to avoid analyzing noise where such analysis is obviously not
needed. Areas that are considered particularly noise-sensitive by the
community, but do not meet the criteria in Table 4-3, should be considered on
a case-by-case basis as discussed in Section 4.1.

**1c.** Residential neighborhoods and relatively large outdoor noise-sensitive areas
can often be clustered, simplifying the analysis that is required without
compromising the accuracy of the analysis. Subdivide all such
neighborhoods/areas into clusters of approximately uniform noise, each
containing a collection of noise-sensitive sites. Strive to obtain uniformity of
both project noise and ambient noise using the following guidelines:

- In general, project noise reduces (drops off) with distance from the project.
For this reason, project noise uniformity requires nearly equal distances
between the project noise source and all sites within the cluster. Clusters
are typically shaped as long narrow strips parallel to the transit corridor
and/or circling project point sources such as maintenance facilities. It is
suggested to cluster sites where the project noise varies over a range of 5
dB or less.

- Note that noise drops off approximately 3 dB per doubling of distance for
line sources and approximately 6 dB per doubling of distance for point
sources over open terrain. This reduction in noise will occur over a shorter
distance in areas containing obstacles blocking the path of sound
propagation, such as rows of buildings.

- Ambient noise usually drops off from non-project sources in the same
manner as noise from project sources. For this reason, clustering for
uniform ambient noise will usually result in long narrow strips parallel to
major roadways or circling major point sources of ambient noise, such as
manufacturing facilities. It is suggested to cluster sites where the ambient
noise varies over a range of 5 dB or less. Ambient noise levels may be
difficult to judge without measurements. In areas without predominant
sources of noise, like highways, ambient noise can be considered to vary
with population density, which is often uniform along the corridor. In
situations where ambient noise tends to be uniform, the clusters can
encompass relatively large areas.

After defining clusters, select one representative receiver in each cluster. It is
recommended to choose the receiver closest to the project noise source and at
an intermediate distance from the predominant sources of existing noise. See
Appendix D for additional guidance and examples on clustering receivers, as
well as an example.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 69

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

Assess each identified cluster representative and individual noise-sensitive
receiver of interest using the Detailed Noise Analysis as presented in the
following steps.

**Step 2: Determine Project Noise Source Reference Levels**

_Identify the major project noise sources near the noise-sensitive receivers of interest,_
_group them by source type, and determine reference levels to compute project noise at_
_50 ft, as shown in Figure 4-11_ .

**Figure 4-11 Flow Diagram for Determining Project Noise at 50ft**

**2a.** Identify the major project noise sources near receivers of interest according
to Table 4-19. The right-hand column of the table indicates if each source is
considered as a major contributor to the overall noise impact. Note that some
noise sources can create high noise levels but are not indicated as major
contributors. Although such sources are loud, they rarely stay in a
neighborhood for more than a day or two; therefore, the overall noise
exposure is relatively minor. Computations are required for all major noise
sources in this table.

**2b.** Separate the major noise sources by source type: fixed-guideway transit,
highway/transit or stationary facility. Note that a major fixed-guideway system
will usually have stationary facilities associated with it, and that a stationary
facility may have highway/transit elements associated with it. Then use the
instructions in the following source type options below to:

**2c.** Determine the source reference levels for the all project noise sources.
Each source reference level pertains to reference operating conditions for
stationary sources or one vehicle passby under reference operating conditions.

These reference levels should incorporate source-noise mitigation only if such
mitigation will be considered for incorporation into the system specifications.
The source levels used in this manual are typical of systems designed according
to current engineering practice, but they do not include special noise control
features that could be incorporated in the specifications at extra cost. If special
features that result in noise reductions are included in any of the predictions,
the Federal environmental documents must include a commitment by the
project sponsor to adopt such treatments before the project is approved for
construction. For example, if the specifications include vehicle noise limits that
may not be exceeded, these limits should be used to determine the reference
level, and this level should be used in the analysis rather than the standard,
tabulated reference level.

**2d.** Convert the source reference level to noise exposure in terms of L eq(1hr) or
L dn under project operating conditions using the appropriate equations
depending upon the type of source. The noise exposure is determined at the
reference distance of 50 ft.

**Option A. Fixed-guideway Sources-** Compute project noise at 50 ft for
fixed-guideway sources as identified in the second column of Table 4-19.

**A.i. Reference SEL Levels**
Determine the reference SEL at 50 ft for each major fixed-guideway noise
source, either by measurement according to Appendix F or by referencing Table
4-20. The table provides guidance on which method is preferred for each
source type. The "NO" designation implies that the source levels given in the
table are appropriate to use in the analysis, and the "YES" designation implies
that measurements are preferred over the data given in the table. In general,
measurements are preferred for source types that vary considerably from
project to project, including any emerging technology sources. The data in the
table are adequate for source types that do not vary considerably from project
to project.

For sources where measurements are preferred, refer to Appendix F for
guidance on measurement procedures and methods for conversion of these
measurements to the reference conditions of Table 4-20. For projects where
source-noise specifications have been defined (e.g., noise limits are usually
included in the specifications for purchase of new transit vehicles), these
specifications may be used instead of measurements after conversion to
reference conditions using the equations in Appendix F. This is only appropriate
when there is a firm commitment to adopt the noise specifications in the vehicle

procurement documents during the engineering phase and to adhere to the
specifications throughout the procurement, delivery, and testing of the vehicles.

Approximate L max values are provided in the table for general user information.
As discussed in Appendix B.1.4.2, L max is not used directly in the evaluation of
noise impact.

- "No" implies that the source levels given in the table are appropriate to use in the analysis and
"Yes" implies that measurements are preferred over the data given in the table.
** The reference speed for streetcars is 25 mph. For streetcar speeds above 25 mph, use the “Rail
Cars” reference level and 50 mph for the reference speed.

**†** Use the following equation for locomotive horns from crossing to 1/8 mile:

ൄശഽ ේ෧෨ ൛ංං඄ൕ඄ൗ ~~(~~ ൉൉ൃ෌ ැ ~~)~~

where:

വ ෘ = distance from grade crossing parallel to tracks

**A.ii. Estimate Noise Exposure at 50 ft** - Use the reference SELs in Table
4-20, operating conditions, and the equations in Table 4-21 to predict the noise
exposure at 50 ft expressed in terms of L eq(1hr) and L dn . Follow the steps below:

1. **Identify operating conditions** - Trains with different numbers of cars or
operating conditions produce different noise exposure levels and should be
converted from SEL to L dn separately. Use the following guidelines to
determine if sources should be converted separately. These differences in
operating conditions will produce an approximate 2-decibel change in noise

exposure:

 - 40 percent change in number of locomotives or cars per train.

 - 40 percent change in number of trains per hour.

 - 40 percent change in number of trains per day, or per night (for
computation of L dn ).

 - 15 percent change in train speed.

 - Change of one notch in diesel locomotive throttle setting (e.g., from
notch 5 to notch 6).

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 73

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

2. **Establish relevant time periods** - For each of these source types and
conditions, determine the relevant time periods for all receivers that may be
affected by this source.

 - For residential receivers, the time periods of interest for
computation of L dn are: daytime (7 a.m. to 10 p.m.) and nighttime
(10 p.m. to 7 a.m.).

 - If the source will affect non-residential receivers, the time period of
interest is the loudest hour of project-related activity during hours
of noise sensitivity. Several different hours may be of interest for
non-residential receivers depending on the hours the facility is used.

**3.** **Collect input data**

 - Source reference SELs for locomotives, rail cars, and warning horns.

 - Number of rail cars in the train (if this number varies during the
day, take the average for the daytime and nighttime periods
separately for category 2 land uses, and use the maximum number
during the period of interest for category 1 or 3 land uses).

 - Number of locomotives in the train, if any.

 - Train speed, in miles per hour (maximum expected).

 - Average throttle setting of the train's locomotive(s) for dieselpowered locomotives and DMU’s only.( [iv) ] If this input is not
available, assume a throttle setting of 8 for locations where the
vehicle would accelerate and 5 for all other locations. [(25) ]

 - For residential receivers of interest:

 Average hourly train volume during daytime hours (the total
number of train passbys between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., divided by
15 hours);
 Average hourly train volume during nighttime hours (the total
number of train passbys between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., divided by
9 hours);

 - For non-residential receivers of interest, number of events that
occur during each hour of interest in trains per hour; and

 - Track type (continuously welded or jointed) and profile (at-grade or
elevated).

**4.** **Calculate L** **eq(1hr)** **at 50ft**

 - Calculate L eq(1hr) using the appropriate equations in Table 4-21 for
each hour of interest.

 - Compute the combined L eq(1hr) . It may be necessary to compute the
combined totals with and without the warning horns; some
neighborhoods along the corridor may be exposed to the horn
noise and some may not.

**5.** **Calculate L** **dn** **at 50ft**

 - If the project noise will affect any residential receivers, calculate the
L dn using the combined day L eq(1hr) and the combined night L eq(1hr) .

 - It may be necessary to calculate L dn with and without the warning
horns, as above.

iv Omit this term if not applicable from the equation in Table 4-21 for other vehicle types.

Note that the equations in Table 4-21 include terms to account for a difference
in speed from the reference speed of 50 mph and a numerical adjustment to
account for the one-hour time period for this metric. For more information on
the numerical adjustment to represent the time period of interest, see

**Example 4-5 Detailed Noise Analysis-** **Fixed Guideway Noise Sources**

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 77

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Option B. Highway/Transit Sources** - Compute project noise at 50 ft for
highway/transit noise sources as identified in the second column of Table 4-19.
Use the instructions below to estimate source noise levels for projects
following FTA’s procedures that involve highway vehicles.

This method is based on the original FHWA highway noise prediction model,
with updated noise emission levels. [(26) ] The vehicle equations are applicable to
speeds typical of freely-flowing traffic on city streets and access roads.

**B.i. Reference SEL Levels** - Determine the reference SEL at 50 ft for each
major highway/transit source, either by measurement according to Appendix F
or by using Table 4-22. [(v) ] The table provides guidance on which method is
preferred for each source type. “NO" implies that the source levels given in the
table are appropriate to use in the analysis, and "YES" implies that
measurements are preferred over the data given in the table. For sources where
measurements are preferred, refer to Appendix F for guidance on measurement
procedures and methods for conversion of measurement data to the reference
conditions in Table 4-20.

Approximate L max values are provided in the table for general user information.
As discussed in Appendix B.1.4.2, L max is not used directly in the evaluation of
noise impact.

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**B.ii. Noise Exposure at 50ft** - Use the reference SELs in Table 4-22,
operating conditions, and the equations in Table 4-23 to predict the noise
exposure at 50 ft expressed in terms of L eq(1hr) and L dn . Follow the steps below:

**1.** **Identify operating conditions** - Noise emission from most transit buses
is not dependent upon whether the buses are accelerating or cruising.
However, accelerating suburban buses are substantially louder than cruising
suburban buses. For this reason, suburban buses require separate
calculation along roadway stretches where they are accelerating. Separate
calculation is also needed for all highway/transit vehicles at different speeds,
since speed affects noise emissions. Use the following guidelines to
determine if sources should be calculated separately. These differences in
operating conditions will produce an approximate 2-decibel change in noise

exposure:

 - 40 percent change in number of vehicles per hour;

 - 40 percent change in number of vehicles per day, or per night (for
computation of L dn ); or

 - 15 percent change in vehicle speed.

**2.** **Establish relevant time periods** - For each of these source types and
conditions, determine the relevant time periods for all receivers that may be
affected by this source.

 - For residential receivers, the time periods of interest for
computation of L dn are: daytime (7 a.m. to 10 p.m.) and nighttime
(10 p.m. to 7 a.m.).

 - If the source will affect non-residential receivers, the time period of
interest is the loudest hour of project related activity during hours
of noise sensitivity. Several different hours may be of interest for
non-residential receivers depending on the hours the facility is used.

**3.** **Collect input data**

 Source reference SELs for the vehicle types of concern

 - Average running speed in miles per hour

 - For residential receivers of interest:

 Average hourly vehicle volume during daytime hours (total
number of vehicle passbys between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., divided
by 15).
 Average hourly vehicle volume during nighttime hours (total
number of vehicle passbys between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., divided
by 9).

 - For non-residential receivers of interest, number of events that
occur during each hour of interest, in vehicles per hour

**4.** **Calculate L** **eq(1hr)** **at 50ft-** **Calculate L** **eq(1hr)** **using the appropriate**

**5.** **Calculate L** **dn** **at 50ft-** If the project noise will affect any residential
receivers, calculate the L dn using the day L eq(1hr) and night L eq(1hr) .

Note that the equations in Table 4-23 include terms to account for a difference
in speed from the reference speed of 50 mph and a numerical adjustment to

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Option C. Stationary Sources** - Compute project noise at 50 ft for
stationary sources as identified in the second column of Table 4-19.

**C.i. Determine Reference SEL Levels** - Determine the reference SEL at 50
ft for each major stationary source, either by measurement according to
Appendix F or by using Table 4-24. The table provides guidance on which
method is preferred for each source type. "NO" implies that the source levels
given in the table are appropriate to use in the analysis, and "YES" implies that
measurements are preferred over the data given in the table. In general,
measurements are preferred for source types that vary considerably from
project to project. For example, curve squeal is highly variable depending on
weather conditions, curve radius, and train speed. The data in the table are
adequate for source types that do not vary considerably from project to project
(crossing signals, for example). For sources where measurements are preferred,
refer to Appendix F for guidance on measurement procedures and methods for
conversion of these measurements to the reference conditions of Table 4-24.

Layover facilities and transit centers can be the sources of low-frequency noise
from idling diesel engines. Sounds with considerable low-frequency components
can cause greater annoyance than would be expected based on their Aweighted levels. Low-frequency sounds often cause windows and walls to
vibrate resulting in secondary effects in buildings such as rattling of dishes in
cupboards and wall-mounted pictures. The reference levels in Table 4-24 are
adjusted to take increased annoyance into account. For a Detailed Noise
Analysis at locations where such idling takes place for an extended period, use
the method described in ANSI Standard S12.9-Part 4, Annex D. [(27) ]

Approximate L max values are provided in the table for general user information.
As discussed in Appendix B.1.4.2, L max is not used directly in the evaluation of
noise impact.

- "No" implies that the source levels given in the table are appropriate to use in the analysis, and "YES" implies

that measurements are preferred over the data given in the table.
**Ferry boat landings are included in the stationary source category because the noise from the landing remains

in one area even though the boats move in and out.

**C.ii. Estimate Noise Exposure at 50 ft** - Use the reference SELs in Table
4-24, operating conditions, and the equations in Table 4-25 to predict the noise
exposure at 50 ft expressed in terms of L eq(1hr) and L dn . Follow the steps below:

1. **Identify operating conditions** - Identify actual source durations and
numbers of events. Sources with different operating conditions should be
converted from SEL to L dn separately. Use the following guidelines to
determine if sources should be converted separately. These differences in
operating conditions will produce an approximate 2-dB change in noise

exposure:

 - 40 percent change in event duration (e.g., from 30 to 42 minutes),

or

 - 40 percent change in number of events per hour (e.g., from 10 to
14 events per hour).

2. **Establish relevant time periods** - For each of these source types and
conditions, determine the relevant time periods for all receivers that may be
affected by this source.

 - For residential receivers, the time periods of interest for
computation of L dn are: daytime (7 a.m. to 10 p.m.) and nighttime
(10 p.m. to 7 a.m.).

 - If the source will affect non-residential receivers, the time period of
interest is the loudest hour of project related activity during hours
of noise sensitivity. Several different hours may be of interest for
non-residential receivers depending on the hours the facility is used.

3. **Collect input data**

 - Source reference SELs for each relevant source

 - Average duration of one event, in seconds

 - For residential receivers of interest:
 Average number of events per hour that occur during the
daytime (the total number of events between 7 a.m. and 10
p.m., divided by 15).

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 82

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

 Average number of events per hour that occur during the
nighttime (the total number of events between 10 p.m. and 7
a.m., divided by 9).

 - For non-residential receivers of interest, number of events that
occur during each hour of interest in events per hour

4. **Calculate L** **eq(1hr)** **at 50 ft** - Calculate L eq(1hr) using the appropriate
equations in Table 4-25 for each hour of interest.

5. **Calculate L** **dn** **at 50ft** - If the project noise will affect any residential
receivers, calculate the L dn using the day L eq(1hr) and night L eq(1hr) .

Note that the equations in Table 4-25 include a numerical adjustment to
account for the one-hour time period for this metric. For more information on
the numerical adjustment to represent the time period of interest, see
Appendix B.1.4.4.

Example 4-8 below.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 84

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

1. Determine the topography of the ground within the transit corridor using
the figures in Table 4-26 as a guide. It is not necessary to represent the
transit corridor with an extreme number of changes in topography. Often,
several typical sections will suffice throughout the transit corridor.

2. Use the equations in Table 4-26 to determine ground factor (G) based on
the effective path height (Heff) for each identified terrain feature. Standard
source heights are included at the bottom of the table. Assume receiver
heights of 5 ft for both outdoor receivers and first-floor receivers. Note
that larger ground factors correspond to larger amounts of ground
attenuation with increasing distance from the source. For acoustically "hard"
(e.g., non-absorptive) ground conditions, G should be taken to be zero.

3. Determine the distance correction factor using the ground factor and
another distance, such as the distance to a receiver, and the equations in
Table 4-27.

4. Apply the distance correction (C distance ) to the project noise exposure at 50
ft (Section 4.5, Step 2) using the following equation:

ഽ ෦෫෵෶෣෰෥෧ ⁡൛⁡ഽ ൈൃ෨෶ ⁡ൔ ഴ ෦෫෵෶෣෰෥෧ **Eq. 4-42**

where:

ഽ ෦෫෵෶෣෰෥෧ = ഽ ෦෰ or ഽ ෉෧ෳ(ൄ෪෴) at the new distance, ft
ഽ ൈൃ෨෶ = ഽ ෦෰ or ഽ ෉෧ෳ(ൄ෪෴) at 50 ft

5. Plot noise exposure as a function of distance if desired.

*These equations assume the distance between the source and receiver is approximately 300 ft or less. At longer
distances, ground effects have an upper limit and atmospheric conditions may affect propagation characteristics. Therefore,
more detailed calculation methods may be required to account for those effects.

**3b.** Calculate the attenuation due to shielding for each distance of interest from
Step 3a, using the following equation and Tables 4-26 through 4-30 and as
illustrated in Example 4-9. If the conditions described in the tables are not met,
the attenuation due to shielding is considered zero. Shielding can be due to
intervening noise barriers, terrain features, rows of buildings, and dense tree

zones.

*These equations assume the distance between the source and receiver is approximately 300 ft or less. At longer
distances, ground effects have an upper limit and atmospheric conditions may affect propagation characteristics.
Therefore, more detailed calculation methods may be required to account for those effects. [(28, 29) ]

**Step 5: Determine Existing Noise Exposure**

_Choose the appropriate method for characterizing noise and then determine the_
_existing noise at each identified noise-sensitive receiver._ The existing noise is needed
to determine the noise impact according to the criteria described in Section 4.1,
Step 2. Recall that impact is assessed based on a comparison of the existing
ambient noise exposure and the additional noise exposure that will be caused by
the project. The existing noise exposure must be estimated for all receivers of
interest identified in Section 4.5, Step 1.

For a Detailed Noise Analysis, it is recommended to measure existing noise at
each receiver of interest identified in Section 4.5, Step 1, for the most precise
assessment of existing noise and conclusions concerning noise impact. However,
measurements are expensive, often thwarted by weather, and take considerable
time in the field. If taking measurements at each identified receiver is not
possible, other less precise methods are available. Different methods may be
used at different receivers along the project. However, it is important to
recognize the correlation between the precision of measurements and the
confidence in the impact assessment. Especially in a Detailed Noise Analysis,
avoid using less precise methods of measuring existing noise just for the sake of
convenience or expediency. The use of less precise methods must be clearly
justified.

**Option A. Noise Exposure Measurements** - Full one-hour measurements
are the most appropriate way to determine ambient noise exposure for
non­residential receivers with the level of precision expected in a Detailed
Noise Analysis **.** For residential receivers, full 24-hour measurements are more
appropriate. These full-duration measurements are preferred over other
methods of characterizing existing noise where time and study funds allow.

Follow the procedures below for these full-duration ambient noise exposure

measurements:

**Ai. Non-residential land uses** - Measure a full hour L eq(1hr) at the receiver of
interest on at least two non-successive weekdays (generally between noon on
Monday and noon on Friday). Select the hour of the day when the maximum
project activity is expected to occur.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 92

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**A.ii. Residential land uses** - Measure a full 24-hour L dn at the receiver of
interest for a single weekday (generally between noon on Monday and noon on
Friday).

**A.iii. Microphone position** - The location of the microphone at the receiver
depends upon the proposed location of the transit noise source, so use good
technical judgment in positioning the measurement microphone. If, for example,
a new rail line will be in front of the house, do not locate the microphone in the
backyard behind the house where the line of sight between the noise source
and receiver is obstructed. Figure 4-19 illustrates recommended measurement
positions for various locations of the project, with respect to the house and the
existing source of ambient noise.

**A.iv. Measurement guidelines** - Undertake all measurements in accordance
with good engineering practice following guidelines given in ASTM and ANSI
standards. [(30)(31) ]

**Figure 4-19 Recommended Microphone Locations**
**for Existing Noise Measurements**

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 93

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Option B. Noise Exposure Computations from Partial Measurements**
- Often, measurements can be made at some of the receivers of interest and
used to estimate noise exposure at nearby receivers. In other situations, several
L eq(1hr) measurements can be taken at a receiver and then the L dn computed
from these. Both options require experience and knowledge of acoustics to
select representative measurement sites. If using this method to compute an
Ldn, a minimum time period of one hour should be used for each measurement
period. It is unacceptable to extrapolate a one hour measurement from a
shorter measurement period.

Measurements at one receiver can be used to represent the noise environment
at other sites, but only when proximity to major noise sources is similar among
the sites. Residential neighborhoods with otherwise similar homes may have
greatly varying noise environments. For example, one area of the neighborhood
may be located where the ambient noise is clearly due to highway traffic. A
second area toward the interior of the neighborhood may have highway noise as
a factor, but also include other noise sources from the community. A third area
located deep into the residential area could have local street traffic and other
community activities dominate the ambient noise. In this example, three or
more measurement sites would be required to represent the varying ambient
noise conditions in a single neighborhood.

Typical situations where representative measurement sites can be used to
estimate noise levels at other sites occur when both share the following
characteristics:

 - Proximity to the same major transportation noise sources, such as
highways, rail lines and aircraft flight patterns

 - Proximity to the same major stationary noise sources, such as power
plants, industrial facilities, rail yards and airports

 - Similar type and density of housing, such as single-family homes on
quarter-acre lots and multi­family housing in apartment complexes

Acoustical professionals are often adept at such computations from partial data
and are encouraged to use their experience and judgment in fully utilizing the
measurements in their computations. This does necessitate a conservative
estimate (underestimate) of existing noise to account for reduced precision
from partial data as compared to full noise measurements.

Those without a background in acoustics are encouraged to use the procedures
in Appendix E to compute existing noise from partial measurements. These
methods include a factor to conservatively estimate (underestimate) existing
noise to account for reduced precision from partial data as compared to full
noise measurements.

**Option C. Estimating Existing Noise Exposure** - The least precise way to
determine noise exposure is to estimate it from a table. This method is often
used for the General Noise Assessment, but it is not recommended for a
Detailed Noise Analysis. It can be used, however, in the absence of better data
for locations where roadways or railroads are the predominant ambient noise
source. Table 4-17 presents these existing levels. The levels in Table 4-17 are

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 94

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

conservative and underestimate existing noise to account for reduced precision
compared to full noise measurements. If a simplified procedure to estimate
existing noise exposure is chosen it must be clearly justified and receive
approval by the FTA Regional office.

While measurements are considered the most precise method, there is one
situation where it may be more accurate to estimate rather than measure the
existing noise exposure, which is in areas near major airports where aircraft
noise is dominant. Because airport noise is highly variable based on weather
conditions and corresponding runway usage, it is preferable in such cases to
base the existing noise exposure on published aircraft noise contours in terms
of Annual Average L dn .

**Step 6: Assess Noise Impact**

Assess noise impact at each receiver of interest identified in Section 4.5, Step 1
using the noise impact criteria in Section 4.1 and the procedures in this step.
Choose the appropriate noise impact assessment procedure for a transit
project or multimodal project.

**Option A. Transit Projects** - For transit projects, noise impact is assessed at
each receiver of interest using the criteria for transit projects described in
Section 4.1. The noise impact assessment procedure is as follows:

**A.i.** Tabulate existing ambient noise exposure (rounded to the nearest whole
decibel) at all receivers identified Section 4.5, Step 1. In cases where large
residential buildings are exposed to noise on one side only, the receivers on
that side are included in the analysis.

**A.ii.** Tabulate project noise exposure at these receivers from Section 4.5,
Step 4.

**A.iii.** Determine the level of noise impact (no impact, moderate impact, or
severe impact) according to Section 4.1.

**A.iv.** Document the results in noise-assessment inventory tables. Include the
following information:

 - Receiver identification and location

 - Land use description

 - Number of noise-sensitive sites represented (number of dwelling units
in residences or acres of outdoor noise-sensitive land)

 - Closest distance to the project

 - Existing noise exposure

 - Project noise exposure

 - Level of noise impact (no impact, moderate impact, or severe impact)

 - A sum of the total number of receivers and numbers of dwelling units
predicted to experience moderate impact or severe impact

**A.v.** Illustrate the areas of moderate impact and severe impact. Two methods
of displaying impact are labeling and contouring.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 95

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

 - In a Detailed Noise Analysis, the most accurate indication of impact is
to label each impacted building or cluster identified in the inventory
table.

 - A less precise illustration of impacted areas is a plot of project noise
contours on the maps or aerial photographs, along with shaded impact
areas. Use the procedures in Section 4.4, Step 6 and the levels from
Section 4.5, Step 2 to develop these contours.

Note that it is difficult to position noise contours in urban areas due to
shielding, terrain features, and other propagation anomalies. If noise contours
are used, they should be considered illustrative rather than definitive. If desired
to conform to the practices of another agency, the contouring may perhaps
include several contour lines of constant project noise, such as L dn 65, L dn 70,
and L dn 75 dBA.

**A.vi.** Including information on the magnitude of the impacts is an essential part
of the assessment. The magnitude of noise impact is defined by the two
threshold curves delineating onset of moderate impact and severe impact.

**Option B. Multimodal Projects** - For multimodal projects, project noise
comprised of both highway and transit noise sources that are assessed
according to the FTA noise impact criteria (see Table 4-2), use the procedure in
Option A above. For multimodal projects that require FHWA’s noise
assessment methods to inform FTA’s evaluation (see Section 4.1, Step 1 ­
Option B), follow the FHWA guidance. [(32) ] In general, the appropriate calculation
method is to use the current version of FHWA’s Traffic Noise Model (TNM). [(22) ]
TNM is a state-of-the-art computer program used for predicting noise impacts
near highways.

TNM allows for a detailed assessment at each receiver of interest by separately
calculating the noise contribution of each roadway segment. For each roadway
segment, the noise from each vehicle type is computed from reference noise
levels, adjusted for:

 - Vehicle volume

 - Vehicle speed

 - Grade

 - Roadway segment length

 - Source-to-receiver distance

Further adjustments needed to accurately model the sound propagation from
source to receiver include:

 - Shielding provided by rows of buildings,

 - Effects of different ground types,

 - Source and receiver elevations, and

 - Effect of any intervening noise barriers.

TNM sums the noise contributions of each vehicle type for a given roadway
segment at the receiver. TNM then repeats this process for all roadway
segments, summing their contributions to generate the predicted noise level at
each receiver.

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Step 7: Determine Noise Mitigation Measures**

Evaluate alternative mitigation measures where the Detailed Noise Analysis
shows either severe or moderate impact, and it is not feasible to change the
alignment or location of the project to avoid impact. Project noise that is found
to cause no impact does not generally require any mitigation.

Mitigation of noise impact from transit projects may involve treatments at the
three fundamental components of the noise problem: at the noise source, along
the source-to-receiver propagation path, or at the receiver. Generally, the
transit property has authority to treat the source and some elements of the
propagation path, but may have little or no authority to modify anything at the
receiver. After mitigation options have been determined, repeat the project
noise computations including the adopted mitigation and reassess the remaining
noise impact.

Approximate costs for noise control measures are documented in a report
from the Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) [(33) ] and are also
presented in this section. These costs reflect the noise mitigation costs available
in 1997 (unless otherwise noted), which are the most recent data available as of
this publication, and should only be used as representative estimates when
considering noise mitigation options. Current noise mitigation costs should be
researched before decisions on noise mitigation options are finalized, and then
they should be documented according to Section 8.

**7a. Evaluate Source Treatments** - The most effective noise mitigation
treatments are applied at the noise source. This is the preferred approach to
mitigation when possible. Common source treatments and their estimated
acoustical effectiveness are included in Table 4-33 and described below. It is

important to note that the values below are estimates and should be applied
with good engineering judgement. It also important to note that these mitigation
measures should not be applied as a reduction in the reference SEL values for a
vehicle that already incorporates that measure as a feature, such as vehicle
skirts. Measurements to determine the reference SEL source level are required
in those instances.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 97

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

- **Stringent Vehicle and Equipment Noise Specifications**
 **Vehicles** - Among the most effective noise mitigation treatments is
noise control during the specification and design of the transit vehicle.
Such source treatments apply to all transit modes. By developing and
enforcing stringent but achievable noise specifications, the transit
property takes a major step in controlling noise everywhere on the
system. It is important to ensure that the noise levels quoted in the
specifications are achievable with the application of best available
technology during the development of the vehicle and reasonable
considering the noise reduction benefits and costs.

Effective enforcement includes penalties for non-compliance with the
specifications. The noise mitigation achieved by source treatment is
dependent on the quality of installation and maintenance. Vehicles failing
to meet the noise specification could result in complaints from the
public and require additional noise mitigation measures applied along the
path or at receivers.

 **Stationary sources** - Stringent but achievable noise specifications for
stationary sources are also an effective approach for mitigating noise
impacts. Typical equipment includes fixed plant equipment such as
transformers and mechanical equipment, as well as grade-crossing
signals. For example, it may be possible to reduce noise impact from
grade-crossing signals in some areas by specifying equipment that sets
the level of the warning signal lower in locations where ambient noise is
lower to minimize the signal noise in the direction of noise-sensitive
receivers.

- **Operational Restrictions** - Changes in operations that can mitigate noise
include the lowering of speed, the reduction of nighttime (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.)
operations, and reduction of warning horns and signals.

 **Speed reduction** - Because noise from most transit vehicles is
dependent on speed, a reduction of speed results in lower noise levels.
The effect can be considerable. For example, the speed dependency of
steel-wheel/steel-rail systems for L eq(1hr) and L dn (Table 4-21) results in a
6-dB reduction when reducing the speed to half of the original speed.

Although there are tangible benefits from speed reductions during the
most noise-sensitive time periods, FTA does not ordinarily accept speed
reduction as a noise mitigation measure for two important reasons:
speed reduction is unenforceable and negated if vehicle operators do
not adhere to established policies, and it is contrary to the purpose of
the transit investment by FTA, which is to move as many people as
possible as efficiently and safely as possible.

 **Reduction of nighttime operations** - Complete elimination of
nighttime operations has a strong effect on reducing the L dn, because
nighttime noise is increased by 10 dB when calculating L dn . But
restrictions on operations are usually not feasible because of service
demands. FTA generally does not pursue restrictions on operations as a

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 98



vi Assumes 8 wheels per vehicle.

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

noise reduction measure. However, if early morning idling can be
curtailed to the minimum necessary, however, this can have a
measurable effect on L dn .

While there are tangible benefits from limits on operations during the
most noise-sensitive time periods, FTA does not recommend limits on
operations as a way to reduce noise impacts because it is contrary to
the purpose of the transit investment by FTA which is to move as many
people as possible as efficiently and safely as possible.

 **Reduction of warning horns and signals** - Minimizing or eliminating
horns and other warning signals at gate crossings can reduce noise
impact for light rail and commuter rail systems. Although these
mitigation options are limited by safety considerations, they can be
effective in the right circumstances. For examples, see quiet zones
below and wayside horns in Step 7b.

**Wheel Treatments (Rail)** - Amajor source of noise from steel-wheel
and steel-rail systems is the wheel/rail interaction that can produce three
distinctive sounds: roar, impact, and squeal (as discussed in Section 3.2).
Roar is the rolling noise caused by small-scale roughness on the wheel tread
and rail running surface. Impacts are caused by discontinuities in the running
surface of the rail or by a flat spot on the wheels. Squeal occurs when a
steel-wheel tread or its flange rubs across the rail, resulting in resonant
vibrations in the wheel that creates a screeching sound. Various wheel
designs and other mitigation measures exist to reduce the noise from each
of these three mechanisms.

 **Resilient wheels** - Resilient wheels are effective in eliminating wheel
squeal on tight turns with reductions of 10 to 20 dB in the highfrequency range where squeal noise occurs. Rolling noise is also slightly
reduced with resilient wheels and typically achieves a 2-dB reduction on
tangent track. The costs for resilient wheels are approximately $2000 to
$3000 per wheel, as compared to about $400 to $700 for standard
steel wheels. [(vi) ]

 **Damped wheels** - Damped wheels, like resilient wheels, are effective
in eliminating wheel squeal on tight turns with reductions of 5 to 15 dB
in the high-frequency range where squeal occurs. Rolling noise is also
slightly reduced by approximately 2 dB on tangent track. This treatment
involves attaching vibration absorbers to standard steel wheels. The
costs for damped wheels add approximately $500 to $1000 to the
normal $700 for each steel wheel.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 99

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

- **Vehicle Treatments** - Vehicle noise mitigation measures are applied to
the various mechanical systems associated with propulsion, ventilation, and
passenger comfort. Propulsion systems of transit vehicles include diesel
engines, electric motors, and diesel-electric combinations. Noise from the
propulsion system depends on the type of unit and how much noise
mitigation is built into the design. Mufflers on diesel engines are generally
required to meet noise specifications; however, mufflers are generally
practical only on buses, not on locomotives. Control of noise from engine
casings may require shielding the engine by body panels without louvers,
dictating other means of cooling, and ventilation.

Ventilation requirements for vehicle systems are related to the noise
generated by a vehicle. Fan noise often remains a major noise source after
other mitigation measures have been instituted because of the need to have
direct access to cooling air. This applies to heat exchangers for electric
traction motors, diesel engines, and air-conditioning systems. The mitigation
options for these systems include:

 **Quiet fan design and placement** - Fan noise can be reduced by
installation of quiet, efficient fans. Forced-air cooling on electric traction
motors can be quieter than self-cooled motors at operating speeds.
Placement of fans on the vehicle can make a considerable difference in

the noise radiated to the wayside or to patrons on the station
platforms.

 **Vehicle skirts and undercar absorption** - The vehicle body design
can provide shielding and absorption of the noise generated by the
vehicle components. Acoustical absorption under the car has been
demonstrated to provide up to 5 dB of mitigation for wheel/rail noise
and propulsion-system noise on rapid transit trains. Similarly, vehicle
skirts over the wheels can provide more than 5 dB of mitigation. By
carrying their own noise barriers, vehicles with these features can
provide cost-effective noise reduction. The cost for vehicle skirts will
add approximately $5000 to $10000 per vehicle. Undercar absorption
will add approximately $3500 per vehicle, assuming that 50% of the
underside of the floor is treated.

- **Preventative Maintenance (Rail)** - Preventative maintenance is the best
strategy to minimize rail and wheel deterioration. While these are not
mitigation measures in the traditional sense and should not be included as
mitigation in an environmental document, they can help to keep both noise
and vibration levels at a “like-new” level or reduce both noise and vibration
in systems with deferred maintenance. This can be accompanied by
considerable life cost benefits for the transit system.

 **Spin-slide control systems** - Similar to anti-locking brake systems
(ABS) on automobiles, spin-slide control systems reduce the incidence
of wheel flats, a major contributor of impact noise. Trains with smooth
wheel treads can be up to 20 dB quieter than those with wheel flats. To
be effective, the anti-locking feature should be in operation during all
braking phases, including emergency braking. Wheel flats are more likely

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 100

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

to occur during emergency braking than during dynamic braking. The
cost of slip-slide control may be incorporated in the new vehicle costs,
but may be between $5,000 and $10,000 per vehicle with a maintenance
cost of $200 per year.

 **Wheel truing** - Maintenance of wheels by truing eliminates wheel flats
from the treads and restores the wheel profile. As discussed above,
wheel flats are a major source of impact noise. As a guideline, it is
recommended that wheel sets match within approximately ±0.01 inch
and all wheels on the same truck should match within ±0.02 inches to

minimize damage and wear to wheels and rails. [(34) ] A wheel truing
machine costs approximately $1 million, including associated
maintenance materials and labor costs. The TCRP report estimates a
system with 700 vehicles would incur a yearly cost of $300,000 to
$400,000 for a wheel truing program.

It is recommended to install wheel-flat detector systems to identify
vehicles that are most in need of wheel truing. These systems are
becoming more common on railroads and intercity passenger systems,
but are relatively rare on transit systems.

 **Rail grinding** - The smoothness of the running surface is critical in the
mitigation of noise from a moving vehicle. Mill scale grinding before
commencement of pre-revenue service train operations is critical.
Experience shows that grinding new rails after approximately 3 months
of train operations and scheduling routine grinding at approximate
intervals of 2 years in the problem areas would minimize noise
problems related to corrugation in most cases. Grinding with small
machines when the corrugation depth is still small is a reasonable
approach. As a guideline, it is recommended to spot-grind at locations
where corrugation occurs before corrugation grows to 0.02 inches (32).

Periodic rail grinding can result in a net savings per year on wheel and
rail wear. Most transit systems contract out rail grinding, although some
of the larger systems make the investment of approximately $1 million
for the equipment and do their own grinding. Contractors typically
charge a fixed amount per day for the equipment on site, plus an
amount per pass-mile (one pass of the grinding machine for one mile).
Typical rail grinding cost would be approximately $7,000 to $10,000 per
pass-mile.

 **Wheel and rail profile matching** - Itisimportant to consider the
wheel and rail profile compatibility when truing wheels and grinding
rails. If the profiles do not match, the benefits of this kind of
preventative maintenance will not be achieved.

It is equally important to consider initial wheel and rail profile
compatibility. Work with track designers and vehicle suppliers early in
the design process to ensure wheel and rail profile compatibility.
Profiles should be defined during the design phase and should be in

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 101

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

place when system opens. [(32) ] The cost of wheel and rail profile matching
may be incorporated in the new vehicle and new rail costs.

Profile grinding of the rail head in combination with a wheel truing
program may be the most practical approach to controlling and
reducing noise and vibration where such practices are not normally
conducted.

 **Maintenance program** - Clearly defined maintenance specifications
should be developed during design phase of the project. The
specifications should define rail and wheel profiles, include detailed
guidance for pre-revenue mill scale grinding, address issues related to
healthy rail-wheel interface, and include a mechanism for periodic
monitoring of wheel and rail condition and verification for
compliance. [(32) ] A diligent maintenance program can often resolve or
reduce rail noise issues before they occur. Vehicle reconditioning
programs should also be developed particularly for components such as
suspension system, brakes, wheels, and slip-slide detectors.

- **Guideway Support (Bus)** - The smoothness of the running surface is
critical in the mitigation of noise from a moving vehicle.
 **Resurfacing roads** - Roughness on the guideway can be eliminated by
resurfacing roads, thereby reducing noise levels by up to 10 dB.

 **Bridge expansion joint angles and design** - Bridge expansion joints
are also a source of noise for rubber-tire vehicles. This source of noise
can be reduced by placing expansion joints on an angle or by specifying
the serrated type rather than joints with right-angle edges.

- **Turn Radii and Rail Lubrication** - For steel-wheel/steel-rail systems
with non-steerable trucks and sharp turns, squeal can typically be eliminated
by designing all turn radii to be greater than 1000 ft, or 100 times the truck
wheelbase, whichever is less. If this is not possible, squeal can be mitigated
by installation of lubricators (though the potential environmental impacts of
lubricant application should be factored into this decision).Rail lubricators
cost approximately $10,000 - $40,000 per curve.

- **Movable-point and Spring-rail Frogs** - Frogs with spring-loaded
mechanisms and frogs with movable points can reduce impact noise near
crossovers. According to the TCRP report, a spring frog costs
approximately $12,000, twice the cost of a standard frog. A movable point
frog involves elaborate signal and control circuitry resulting in higher costs
of approximately $200,000.

- **Use of Locomotive Horns at-grade Crossings and Quiet Zones** - In
cases where commuter rail operations share tracks or ROW with freight or
intercity passenger trains that are part of the general railroad system, the
safety rules of the FRA, including the Train Horn Rule, apply. [(35) ] The Train
Horn Rule requires that locomotive horns be sounded at public highway
grade crossings, although some exceptions are allowed in carefully defined
circumstances. Locomotive horns are often a major contributor in

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 102

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

projections of adverse noise impact, in the community from proposed
commuter rail projects. Since noise barriers are not feasible at highway-rail
grade crossings, the establishment of quiet zones could be considered.

Quiet zones can be established in which supplemental safety measures
(SSMs) are used in place of the locomotive horn to provide an equivalent
level of safety at-grade crossings. [(vii) ] By adopting an approved SSM at each
public grade crossing, a quiet zone of at least a half-mile long can be
established. These measures are in addition to the standard safety devices
required at most public grade crossings (e.g., stop signs, reflectorized
crossbucks, flashing lights with gates that do not completely block travel
over the tracks). Below are four SSMs that have been predetermined by the
FRA to fully compensate for the lack of a locomotive horn:
 **Temporary closure of a public highway-rail grade crossing** -
This measure requires closure of the grade crossing for one period each
24 hours, and the closure must occur at the same time each day.
 **Four-quadrant gate system** - This measure involves the installation
of at least one gate for each direction of traffic to fully block vehicles
from entering the crossing.
 **Gates with medians or channelization devices** - This measure
keeps traffic in the proper travel lanes as it approaches the crossing.
This denies the driver the option of circumventing the gates by traveling
in the opposing lane.
 **One-way street with gates** - This measure consists of one-way
streets with gates installed, so that all approaching travel lanes are
completely blocked.

In addition to the pre-approved SSMs, the FRA rule also identifies a range of
other measures that may be used in establishing a quiet zone. These could
include modified SSMs or non-engineering types of measures, such as
increased monitoring by law enforcement for grade crossing violations or
instituting public education and awareness programs that emphasize the
risks associated with grade crossings and applicable requirements. These
alternative safety measures (ASMs) require approval by FRA based on a
demonstration that public safety would not be compromised by eliminating
horn usage.

The lead agency for designating a quiet zone is the local public authority
responsible for traffic control and law enforcement on the roads crossing
the tracks. To satisfy the FRA regulatory requirements, the public transit
agency must work closely with this agency while also coordinating with any
freight or passenger railroad operator sharing the ROW. The final
environmental document should discuss the main considerations in adopting
the quiet zone including: the engineering feasibility, receptiveness of the
local public authority, consultation with the railroad, preliminary cost
estimates, and evidence of the planning and interagency coordination that
has occurred to date. If a quiet zone will be relied on as a mitigation
measure, the final environmental document should provide reasonable

vii [For more information on quiet zones, visit: https://www.fra.dot.gov/Page/P0889.](https://www.fra.dot.gov/Page/P0889)

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 103

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

assurance that any remaining issues can and will be resolved. For more
information on documentation requirements see Section 8.

The cost of establishing a quiet zone varies considerably, depending on the
number of intersections that must be treated and the specific SSMs, ASMs,
or combination of measures that are used. The FRA gives a cost estimate of
$15,000 per crossing for installing two 100-foot-long, non-traversable
medians that prevent motorists from driving around closed gates. A typical
installation of a four-quadrant gate system is in the range of $175,000-
$300,000 per crossing. [(36) ] Who pays for the installation of modifications can
become a major consideration in a decision to pursue a quiet zone
designation, especially in cases where noise from preexisting railroad
operations is controversial in the community. In many cases where a quiet
zone would mitigate a severe impact caused by the proposed transit project,
the costs are covered by the project sponsor and FTA in the same
proportion as the overall cost-sharing for the project.

**7b. Evaluate Path Treatments** - When noise mitigation treatments cannot
be applied at the noise source or additional mitigation is required after treating
the source, the next preferred placement of noise mitigation is along the noise
propagation path between the source and receiver. Common path treatments
and their estimated acoustical effectiveness are included in Table 4-34 and

described below.

**Table 4-34 Transit Noise Mitigation Measures-** **Path Treatments**

|Mitigation Measure|Effectiveness|
|---|---|
|<br><br>~~Noise barriers close to vehicles~~<br>|<br><br>~~6-15 dB~~<br>|
|<br><br>~~Noise barriers at row line~~<br>|<br><br>~~3-15 dB(37)~~<br>|
|<br><br>~~Alteration of horizontal & vertical alignments~~<br>|<br><br>~~Varied~~<br>|
|<br><br>~~Wayside horns~~<br>|<br><br>~~Varied~~<br>|

|<br><br>~~Ballast on at-grade guideway~~~~*** **~~<br>|<br><br>~~3 dB~~<br>|
|<br><br>~~Ballast on aerial guideway~~~~*** **~~<br>|<br><br>~~5 dB~~<br>|
|<br><br>~~Resilient track support on aerial guideway~~<br>|<br><br>~~Varied~~<br>|
|<br><br>~~Vegetation and trees~~<br>|<br><br>~~Varied, see Table 4-30~~|

***** Applies to rail projects only.

- **Noise Barriers** - Noise barriers are effective in mitigating noise when they
break the line-of-sight between source and receiver. The mechanism of
sound shielding is described in Section 3.3. The necessary height of a barrier
depends on the source height and the distance from the source to the
barrier, see Table 4-28 and Figure 4-18.
 **Noise barriers close to vehicles** - Barriers located very close to a
rapid transit train, for example, may only need to be approximately 3 to
4 ft above the top of rail to be effective. Standard barriers close to
vehicles can provide noise reductions of 6 to 10 dB.
 **Noise barriers at ROW line-** Barriers on the ROW line or for
trains on the far track, the height must be increased to provide
equivalent effectiveness to barriers located close to the vehicles.
Otherwise, the effectiveness can drop to 3 dB or less, even if the
barrier breaks the line-of-sight.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 104

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

All barrier effectiveness can be increased by as much as 5 dB by applying
sound-absorbing material to the inner surface of the barrier. The length of
the barrier wall is also important to its effectiveness. The barrier must be
long enough to block noise from a moving train along most of its visible
path. This is necessary so that train noise from beyond the ends of the
barrier will not severely compromise noise-barrier performance at noisesensitive locations. The barrier length can be refined in the engineering
phase, closely examining the predicted sound level exceedances at specific
receivers, site geometries, and the contribution of barrier flanking noise,
then adjusting the length as appropriate.

Noise barriers can be made of any outdoor weather-resistant solid material
that meets the minimum sound transmission loss required by the project.
Materials that are commonly used for noise barriers include 16-gauge steel,
1-inch thick plywood, and any reasonable thickness of concrete. Typically, a
surface density of 4 pounds per square foot is required. Areas with strong
winds may require more stringent structural requirements. It is critical to
seal any gaps between barrier panels and between the barrier and the
ground or elevated guideway deck for maximum performance.

Costs for noise barriers (based on highway installations) range from $20 to
$25 per square foot of installed noise barrier at-grade with additional cost
for design and inspection. [(38) ] Installation on aerial structures could be twice
the amount of installation at-grade, especially if the structure has to be
strengthened to accommodate the added weight and wind load.

As described in Section 3.3, noise barriers, if not designed and sited
carefully, can reduce visibility of trains for pedestrians and motorists, which
causes safety concerns. It is important to consult with safety experts in
choosing and siting a noise barrier.

- **Alteration of Horizontal and Vertical Alignments** - Transit alignment
in a cut as part of grade separation can accomplish the same result as
installation of a noise barrier at-grade or on aerial structure. The walls of
the cut serve the same function as barrier walls in breaking the line-of-sight
between source and receiver.

- **Wayside Horns** - The sounding of a locomotive horn as the train
approaches an at-grade intersection produces a very wide noise footprint in
the community. Using wayside horns at these intersections instead of the
locomotive horn can substantially reduce the noise footprint without
compromising safety at the grade crossing.

A wayside horn does not need to be as loud as a locomotive horn, and the
warning sound is focused only on the area where it is needed. These are
pole-mounted horns used in conjunction with flashing lights and gates at the
intersection, with a separate horn oriented toward each direction of
oncoming vehicle traffic. Noise levels in nearby residential and business
areas can be reduced substantially with wayside horns, depending on the
location with respect to the grade crossing.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 105

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

A plan to use wayside horns in place of the locomotive horn at public grade
crossings must be coordinated with several public and private entities,
notably the local agency having responsibility for traffic control and law
enforcement on the road crossings, the state agency responsible for railroad
safety, any railroads that share the ROW, and FRA. Public notification must
also be given. Preliminary cost information from testing programs indicates a
wayside horn system at a railroad/highway grade crossing costs
approximately $50,000.

- **Buffer Zones** - Because noise levels attenuate with distance, one noise
mitigation option is to increase the distance between noise sources and the
closest noise-sensitive receivers. This can be accomplished by locating
alignments away from noise-sensitive sites. Acquisition of land or purchasing
easements for noise buffer zones is an option that may be considered if
appropriate for the project.

- **Ground Absorption-** **Ballast on Guideways** - Propagation of noise
over ground is affected by whether the ground surface is absorptive or
reflective. Noise from vehicles on the surface is strongly affected by the
character of the ground in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle. Roads and
streets for buses are hard and reflective, but the ground at the side of a
road has a substantial effect on the propagation of noise to greater distance.
Guideways for rail systems can be either reflective or absorptive, depending
on whether they are concrete or ballast. Ballast on a guideway can reduce
train noise 3 dB at-grade and up to 5 dB on an aerial structure.

- **Vegetation and Trees** - In almost all cases, vegetation and trees are
ineffective at providing noise mitigation. Vegetation and Trees can provide
some mitigation if at least 100 ft of trees intervene between the source and
receiver, if no clear line-of-sight exists between the source and receiver, and
if the trees extend 15 ft or more above the line-of-sight as described in
Section 4.5, Step 3b. This is generally not a recommended form of
mitigation to pursue.

**7c. Evaluate Receiver Treatments-** Consider treatments to the receivers

when noise mitigation treatments cannot be applied at the source or along the
propagation path, or if combinations of treatments are required. Common
receiver treatments and their estimated acoustical effectiveness are included in

Table 4-35 and are described in this section.

**Table 4-35 Transit Noise Mitigation Measures-** **Receiver Treatments**

|Mitigation Measure|Effectiveness|
|---|---|
|<br> <br> <br> <br>Acquisition of Property Rights for Construction of Noise Barriers|<br>5-10 dB|
|<br><br>Building Noise Insulation|<br>5-20 dB|

- **Noise Barriers** - Incertain cases, it may be possible to acquire limited
property rights for the construction of noise barriers at the receiver. As
discussed above, barriers need to break the line-of-sight between the noise
source and the receiver to be effective and are most effective when they are

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 106

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

closest to either the source or the receiver. See Section 3.3 for more

information on noise barriers.

- **Building Insulation** - Incases where noise barriers are not feasible--such
as multi-story buildings, buildings very close to the ROW, or grade
crossings--the only practical noise mitigation measure may be to provide
sound insulation for the buildings. In these cases, the need for mitigation at
locations where impact has been identified will depend on the use (outdoor
vs. indoor), any existing outdoor to indoor reduction in noise levels, and the
feasibility of constructing effective noise barriers for second stories and
above.

Depending on the quality of the original building façade, especially windows
and doors, sound insulation treatments can improve the noise reductions
from transit noise by 5 to 20 dB. To be considered cost-effective, a
treatment should provide a minimum reduction of 5 dB in the interior of
the building and meet the L dn 45 dBA interior criterion. For more
information, see Section 4.1.

In many cases, especially in locations with high ambient noise levels, the
existing sound insulation of a building may already meet the 45 dBA L dn
interior noise criterion. It is recommended that sound insulation testing be
conducted to determine if the existing sound insulation is sufficient or what
additional measures would be required to meet the interior criterion.
Effective treatments include:
 Caulking and sealing gaps in the building façade; and
 Installation of new doors and windows that are specially designed to
meet acoustical transmission-loss requirements:

```
 ­
```
Exterior doors facing the noise source should be replaced with
well­gasketed, solid-core wood doors and well-gasketed storm
doors.

```
 ­
```

Acoustical windows are typically made of multiple layers of glass
with air spaces between to provide noise reduction. Acoustical
performance ratings are published in terms of Sound Transmission
Class (STC) for these windows. It is recommended to use a
minimum STC rating of 39 on any window exposed to the noise

source.

These treatments are beneficial for heat insulation as well as for sound

insulation, but acoustical windows are typically non-operable and central
ventilation or air conditioning is needed. Residents’ preferences should be
considered.

If needed, additional building sound insulation can be provided by sealing
vents and ventilation openings and relocating them to a side of the building
away from the noise source. In cases where the noise sources is lowfrequency noise from diesel locomotives, it may be necessary to increase
the mass of the building façade for wood-frame houses by adding a layer of
sheathing to the exterior walls.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 107

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

Examples of residential sound insulation for rail or highway projects are
limited. However, much practical experience with sound insulation of
buildings has been gained through grants for noise mitigation to local airport
authorities by FAA.

Transit Vibration

This section presents the basic concepts of transit ground-borne vibration, also
referred throughout this manual as simple “vibration,” and low-frequency
groundborne-noise that sometimes results from vibration. The steps for the
screening and assessing of potential vibration impacts of transit projects for FTA
NEPA approval are described in the following sections.

The Source-Path-Receiver framework for ground-borne vibration for a rail
system illustrated in Figure 5-1 is central to all environmental vibration studies.
The train wheels rolling on the rails create vibration energy that is transmitted
through the track support system into the transit structure. The vibration of the
transit structure excites the adjacent ground, creating vibration waves that
propagate through the ground and into nearby buildings creating ground-borne
vibration effects that potentially interfere with activities. The vibrating building
components may radiate sound, which this manual refers to as ground-borne
noise. Airborne noise from transit sources is covered in Sections 2.3-4.5 of this
manual. Ground-borne noise refers to the noise generated by ground-borne
vibration.

**Figure 5-1 Propagation of Ground-Borne Vibration into Buildings**

This section contains the following:

 - Section 5.1 The ground-borne vibration and noise metrics used in this
manual

 - Section 5.2 An overview of transit vibration sources

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 109

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

 - Section 5.3 An overview of transit vibration paths

 - Section 5.4 An overview of receiver factors of transit vibration and a
discussion of the technical background for ground-borne noise criteria

5.1 Ground-Borne Vibration and Noise Metrics

Vibration is an oscillatory motion that can be described in terms of the
displacement, velocity, or acceleration. Because the motion is oscillatory, there
is no net movement of the vibration element and the average of any of the
motion metrics is zero. Displacement is the most intuitive metric. For a
vibrating floor, the displacement is simply the distance that a point on the floor
moves away from its static position. The velocity represents the instantaneous
speed of the floor movement and acceleration is the rate of change of the
speed.

Although displacement is easier to understand than velocity or acceleration, it is
rarely used for describing ground-borne vibration. Most transducers used for
measuring ground-borne vibration use either velocity or acceleration.
Furthermore, the response of humans, buildings, and equipment to vibration is
more accurately described using velocity or acceleration.

This manual uses the metrics outlined in Table 5-1 for transit ground-borne
vibration and noise measurements, computations, and assessment. These
metrics are consistent with common usage in the United States.

**Table 5-1 Ground-borne Vibration and Noise Metrics**

|Metric|Abbreviation|Definition|
|---|---|---|
|<br>~~Vibration Decibels~~|<br>~~VdB~~|<br> <br> <br><br><br><br>~~The vibration velocity level in decibel scale.~~<br>|
|<br>Peak Particle Velocity|<br>PPV|<br> <br> <br> <br><br>~~The peak signal value of an oscillating vibration velocity waveform.~~<br>Usually expressed in inches/second in the United States.<br>|

The metrics in the table above are illustrated in Figure 5-2. The components in
the figure include:

 - **Raw signal** - This curve shows the instantaneous vibration velocity,
which fluctuates positively and negatively about the zero point.

 - **Peak particle velocity (PPV)** - PPV is the maximum instantaneous
positive or negative peak of the vibration signal. PPV is often used in
monitoring of construction vibration (such as blasting) since it is related
to the stresses that are experienced by buildings and is not used to
evaluate human response.

 - **Root mean square (rms) velocity** - Because the net average of a
vibration signal is zero, the rms amplitude is used to describe smoothed
vibration amplitude. The rms of a signal is the square root of the

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 110

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

average of the squared amplitude of the signal. The average is typically
calculated over a one-second period. The rms amplitude is always less
than the PPV [(viii) ] and is always positive. The rms amplitude is used to
convey the magnitude of the vibration signal felt by the human body, in
inches/second.

**Figure 5-2 Vibration Signal in Absolute Units**

The PPV and rms velocity are described in inches per second in the United
States and meters per second internationally (with several different reference
values). Although it is not universally accepted, vibration is commonly expressed
in decibel notation. The decibel scale compresses the range of numbers
required to describe vibration.

The graph in Figure 5-3 shows the rms curve from Figure 5-2 expressed in
decibels.

Vibration velocity level in decibels is defined as:

ൡ
ഽ ෸ ൛ ⁡ඃඁ ඝච඘
ൡ
( ෴෧෨ )

**Eq. 5-1**

where:

ഽ ෸ = velocity level, VdB
ൡ = rms velocity amplitude

= 1 x 10 [-6] in/sec in the USA
ൡ ෴෧෨
= 1 x 10 [-8] m/sec internationally [* ]

*Because of the variations in the reference quantities, it is important to be clear about what
reference quantity is being used when specifying velocity levels. All vibration levels in this
manual are referenced to 1x10 [-6 ] inches/second.

viii The ratio of PPV to maximum rms amplitude is defined as the crest factor for the signal. The crest factor is typically greater
than 1.41, although a crest factor of 8 or more is not unusual for impulsive signals. For ground-borne vibration from trains, the
crest factor is usually 4 to 5.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 111

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Figure 5-3 Vibration Signal in RMS Velocity Decibels**

Ground-borne noise occurs when vibration radiates through a building interior
and creates a low-frequency sound, often described as a rumble, as a train
passes by. The annoyance potential of ground-borne noise is typically
characterized with the A-weighted sound level. Although the A-weighted sound
level is typically used to characterize community noise, characterizing lowfrequency noise using A-weighting can be challenging because the non-linearity
of human hearing causes sounds dominated by low-frequency components to
seem louder than broadband sounds (sounds consisting of many frequency
components, with no dominant frequencies) that have the same A-weighted
level. The result is that ground-borne noise with a level of 40 dBA sounds
louder than 40 dBA broadband noise. Because ground-borne noise sounds
louder than broadband noise at the same noise level, the limits for groundborne noise are lower (i.e., stricter) than would be the case for broadband
noise.

5.2 Sources of Transit Ground-borne Vibration

and Noise

Ground-borne vibration can be a concern for nearby neighbors of a transit
system route or maintenance facility. However, in contrast to airborne noise,
ground-borne vibration is not a common environmental problem. It is unusual
for vibration from sources such as buses and trucks to be perceptible, even in
locations close to major roads. This section discusses common sources of
ground-borne vibration and noise.

Most perceptible indoor vibration is caused by sources within buildings such as
operation of mechanical equipment, movement of people, or slamming of doors.
Typical outdoor sources of vibration waves that propagate through the ground
and create perceptible ground-borne vibration in nearby buildings include
construction equipment, steel-wheeled trains, and traffic on rough roads. If the
roadway is fairly smooth, the vibration from rubber-tired traffic is rarely
perceptible. Building damage due to vibration is also rare for typical
transportation projects; but in extreme cases, such as during blasting or piledriving during construction, vibration could cause damage to buildings.

Figure 5-4 illustrates common vibration sources and the human and structural
response to ground-borne vibration ranging from approximately 50 VdB (below

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 112

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

perceptibility) to 100 VdB (the threshold of potential damage). The background
vibration velocity level in residential areas is usually 50 VdB or lower, [(ix) ] and the
threshold of perception for humans is approximately 65 VdB. A vibration level
of 85 VdB in a residence can result in strong annoyance.

**Figure 5-4 Typical Levels of Ground-Borne Vibration**

Rapid transit or light rail systems typically generate vibration levels of 70 VdB or
more near their tracks, while buses and trucks rarely create vibration that
exceeds 70 VdB unless there are bumps due to frequent potholes in the road.
Heavy locomotives on diesel commuter rail systems create vibration levels
approximately 5 to 10 dB higher than rail transit vehicles.

Vibration from trains is strongly dependent on factors such as how smooth the
wheels and rails are, as well as the resonance frequencies of the vehicle
suspension system and the track support system. These systems, like all
mechanical systems, have resonances that result in increased vibration response
at certain frequencies, called natural frequencies. Unusually rough road or track,
steel-wheel flats, geologic conditions that promote efficient propagation of
vibration, or vehicles with very stiff suspension systems could increase typical

ix Background vibration is typically well below the threshold of human perception and is of concern only when the vibration
affects very sensitive manufacturing or research equipment. Electron microscopes and high-resolution lithography equipment
are examples of equipment that is highly sensitive to vibration.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 113

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

vibration levels by approximately 10 VdB. Common factors that contribute to
ground-borne vibration and noise at the source are presented in Table 5-2.
These factors are discussed in more detail throughout this Section.

**Table 5-2 Factors that Influence Levels of Ground-Borne Vibration and Noise at the Source**

Brief discussions of ground-borne vibration and noise sources for different
modes of transit are provided below.

**At-Grade Heavy Rail and Light Rail**
Ground-borne vibration and noise from urban heavy rail and LRT is common
when there is less than 50 ft between the track and building foundations. Local
geology and structural details of the building determine if the source of
complaints is due to perceptible vibration or audible ground-borne noise.
Complaints about ground-borne vibration from surface track are more common
than ground-borne noise complaints. A substantial percentage of complaints
about both ground-borne vibration and noise correlate with proximity of special
track work, rough or corrugated track, or wheel flats. Light rail systems tend to
generate fewer complaints than heavy rail due to lower operating speeds.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 114

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Commuter and Intercity Passenger Trains**
There is the potential for vibration-related issues when new commuter or
intercity rail passenger service (including electric multiple units (EMUs) and
diesel multiple units (DMUs)) powered by either diesel or electric locomotives
is introduced in an urban or suburban area. Commuter and intercity passenger
trains have similar characteristics, but commuter trains typically operate on a
more frequent schedule. These passenger trains often share track with freight
trains, which have different vibration characteristics as discussed below.

**Freight Trains**
Local and long-distance freight trains are similar in that they both are dieselpowered and have the same types of cars. They differ in their overall length,
number and size of locomotives, and number of heavily loaded cars. However,
because locomotive suspensions are similar, the maximum vibration levels of
local and long-distance freights are similar. Locomotives and rail cars with wheel
flats are the sources of the highest vibration levels.

If the transit project does not in any way change the freight service, tracks, etc.,
then vibration from the freight line would be part of the existing conditions and
need to be considered in terms of cumulative impacts (see Section 6.2, Step 3
on how to consider cumulative impacts). If the project results in changes to the
freight path, operations, frequency, etc. (e.g., relocating freight tracks within the
ROW to make room for the transit tracks) then those potential impacts and
mitigation should be evaluated as part of the proposed project. However, note
that vibration mitigation is very difficult to implement on tracks where freight
trains with heavy axle loads operate.

**-**
**High** **Speed Passenger Trains**
Passenger trains travelling at high speeds, 90 to 250 miles per hour, have the
potential for creating high levels of ground-borne vibration. Ground-borne
vibration should be anticipated as one of the major environmental impacts of
any trains travelling at high speeds located in an urban or suburban area. [(x) ] For
projects that are specifically high-speed transportation refer to the FRA “HighSpeed Ground Transportation Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment”
guidance manual. [(39) ]

**AGT Systems**
AGT systems include a wide range of transportation vehicles that provide local
circulation in downtown areas, airports, and theme parks. Because AGT
systems normally operate at low speeds, have lightweight vehicles, run on
elevated structures, and rarely operate in vibration-sensitive areas, groundborne vibration problems are very rare.

**-**
**Subway and At** **grade Track**

 - While ground borne vibration produced from trains operating subway and at
grade track have very different characteristics, they have comparable overall
vibration velocity levels. Complaints about ground-borne vibration are often
more common near subways than near at-grade track. This is not because

x Amtrak trains (branded Acela at the time of publication) on the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington, DC,
which attain moderate to high speeds in some sections with improved track, fit into this category.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 115

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

subways create higher vibration levels than at-grade systems, rather because
subways are usually located in more densely developed areas in closer proximity
to building foundations, and the airborne noise is usually a more serious
problem for at-grade systems than the ground-borne vibration. Another
difference between subway and at-grade track is that the ground-borne
vibration from subways tends to be higher frequency than the vibration from atgrade track, which makes the ground-borne noise more noticeable.

**Streetcars**
Complaints about ground-borne vibration from street cars are uncommon given
that streetcars typically operate at very low speeds (less than 25 mph).

**Buses**
Because the rubber tires and suspension systems of buses provide vibration
isolation, it is unusual for buses to cause ground-borne vibration or noise
problems. For most issues with bus-related vibration, such as rattling of
windows, the cause is almost always airborne noise and directly related to
running surface conditions such as potholes, bumps, expansion joints, or other
discontinuities in the road surface (usually resolved by smoothing the
discontinuities).

Buses operating inside buildings will likely cause vibration concerns for other
building inhabitants. An example of this situation is a bus transfer station in the
same building as commercial office space. Sudden loading of a building slab by a
heavy moving vehicle or by vehicles running over lane divider bumps can cause
intrusive building vibration.

5.3 Paths of Transit Ground-Borne Vibration and

Noise

Vibration travels from the source through the transit structure and excites the
adjacent ground, creating vibration waves that propagate through soil layers and
rock strata to the foundations of nearby buildings. The vibration then
propagates from the foundation throughout the remainder of the building
structure. The vibration of the building structure and room surfaces can radiate
a low-frequency rumble called ground-borne noise (Figure 5-1).

Soil and subsurface conditions are known to have a strong influence on the
levels of ground-borne vibration. Among the most important factors are the
stiffness and internal damping of the soil and the depth to bedrock. Vibration
propagation is more efficient in stiff clay soils. Shallow rock may concentrate the
vibration energy close to the surface, resulting in ground-borne vibration
problems at large distances from the track. Factors such as soil layers and depth
to water table can have substantial effects on the propagation of ground-borne
vibration. These factors are summarized in Table 5-3.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 116

|Geology Factors|Influence|
|---|---|
|<br>~~Soil type~~|<br> <br> <br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>~~Vibration levels are generally higher in stiff clay-type soil than in loose sandy soil.~~<br>|

|<br>Soil layering|<br> <br> <br><br>~~Soil layering can have a substantial effect on the vibration levels since each stratum can~~<br>have considerably different dynamic characteristics.<br>|
|<br>Depth to water table|<br> <br>~~The presence of the water table may have a substantial effect on vibration, but a~~<br>definite relationship has not been established.|

5.4 Receiver Factors that Influence Ground
Borne Vibration and Noise

Ground-borne vibration is a concern almost exclusively inside buildings. Train
vibration may be perceptible to people who are outdoors, but it is very rare for
outdoor vibration to cause complaints.

The vibration levels inside a building are dependent on the vibration energy that
reaches the building foundation, coupling of the building foundation to the soil,
and propagation of the vibration through the building. In general, the heavier a
building is, the lower the response will be to the incident vibration energy.
Common factors that contribute to ground-borne vibration and noise at the
receiver are presented in Table 5-4.

**Table 5-4 Factors that Influence Levels of Ground-Borne Vibration and Noise at the Receiver**

|Receiver Building<br>Factors|Influence|
|---|---|
|<br>Foundation type|<br> <br>The heavier the building foundation, the greater the coupling loss as the vibration<br>propagates from the ground into the building.|
|<br> <br>Building<br>construction|<br> <br> <br> <br><br>Each building has different characteristics relative to structure-borne vibration, but, in<br>general, the heavier the building, the lower the levels of vibration. The maximum<br>vibration amplitudes of the floors and walls of a building will often occur at the<br>resonance frequencies of the components of the building.<br>|
|<br>Acoustical<br>absorption|<br> <br> <br> <br>~~The more acoustically absorptive materials in the receiver room, the lower the~~<br>ground-borne noise level. Note that because ground-borne noise usually is a low-<br>frequency phenomenon, it is affected by low-frequency absorption (e.g., below 250<br>Hz).|

5.5 Human Response to Transit Ground-borne

Vibration and Noise

This section contains an overview of human receiver response to ground-borne
vibration and noise. It serves as background information for the vibration impact
criteria in Section 6.2.

The effects of ground-borne vibration can include perceptible movement of
floors in buildings, rattling of windows, shaking of items on shelves or hanging on
walls, and low-frequency noise (ground-borne noise). Building damage is not a

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 117

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

factor for typical transportation projects, but in extreme cases, such as during
blasting or pile-driving during construction, vibration could cause damage to
buildings. Although the perceptibility threshold is approximately 65 VdB, human
response to vibration is not usually substantial unless the vibration exceeds 70
VdB (Figure 5-4). A vibration level that causes annoyance is well below the
damage risk threshold for typical buildings (100 VdB).

Ground-borne vibration is almost never a problem outdoors. Although the
motion of the ground may be perceived, without the effects associated with the
shaking of a building, the motion does not provoke the same adverse human
reaction. Ground-borne noise that accompanies the building vibration is usually
perceptible only inside buildings and typically is only an issue at locations with
subway or tunnel operations where there is no airborne noise path or for
buildings with substantial sound insulation such as a recording studio.

One of the challenges in developing suitable criteria for ground-borne vibration
is that there has been relatively little research into human response to vibration
and, specifically, human annoyance with building vibration. The American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) developed criteria for evaluation of human
exposure to vibration in buildings in 1983, [(40) ] and the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) adopted similar criteria in 1989 [(41) ] and revised them in
2003. [(42) ] The 2003 version of ISO 2631-2 acknowledges that “human response
to vibration in buildings is very complex.” It further indicates that the degree of
annoyance cannot always be explained by the magnitude of the vibration alone.
In some cases, complaints are associated with measured vibration that is lower
than the perception threshold. Other phenomena such as ground-borne noise,
rattling, visual effects such as movement of hanging objects, and time of day (e.g.,
late at night) all play some role in the response of individuals. To understand and
evaluate human response, which is often measured by complaints, all of these
related effects need to be considered.

Figure 5-5 illustrates the relationship between the vibration velocity level
measured in 22 homes and the general response of the occupants to the
vibration from measurements performed for several transit systems along with
subjective ratings by researchers and residents. These data are published in the
“State-of-the-Art Review of Ground-borne Noise and Vibration.” [(43) ] The figure
also includes a curve representing the percent of people annoyed by vibration
from high-speed trains from a Japanese study for comparison. [(44) ]

Both the occupants and the people who performed the measurements agreed
that floor vibration in the Distinctly Perceptible range is unacceptable for a
residence. The data indicates that residential vibration exceeding 75 VdB is
unacceptable for a repetitive vibration source such as rapid transit trains that
pass every 5 to 15 minutes. The results from the Japanese study confirm the
conclusion that at a vibration velocity level of 75 to 80 VdB, many people will
find the vibration annoying. A Transportation Research Board (TRB) study of
human response to vibration from 2009 also supports this finding and indicates
that incidence of complaints fall rapidly with a level decreasing below 72
VdB. [(42)(45) ]

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 118

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Figure 5-5 Response to Transit-Induced Residential Vibration**

Table 5-5 presents the human response to different levels of ground-borne
vibration and noise on which the criteria presented in Section 6.2 are based.
The vibration level (VdB) is presented with the corresponding frequency
assuming that the vibration spectrum peaks at 30 Hz or 60 Hz. [(xi) ] The groundborne noise levels (dBA) are estimated for the specified vibration velocity with a
peak vibration spectrum of 30 Hz (Low Freq) and 60 Hz (Mid Freq). Note that
the human response differs for vibration velocity level based on frequency. For
example, the noise caused by vibrating structural components may cause
annoyance even though the vibration cannot be felt. Alternatively, a lowfrequency vibration can cause annoyance while the ground-borne noise level it
generates does not.

xi The A-weighted level of ground-borne noise can be estimated by applying A-weighting to the vibration velocity spectrum and
by subtracting an additional 5 dB for a room with average acoustical absorption. Since the A-weighting at 31.5 Hz is -39.4 dB, if
the vibration spectrum peaks at 30 Hz, the A-weighted sound level will be approximately 40 dB lower than the velocity level. If
the vibration spectrum peaks at 60 Hz, the A-weighted sound level will be approximately 25 dB lower than the velocity level.

Vibration Impact Analysis

The FTA vibration impact analysis process is a multi-step process used to
evaluate a project for potential vibration impacts. If impact is determined,
measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts are to be considered for
incorporation into the project. [(3) ]

The FTA vibration impact analysis steps are summarized as follows and are
described in the following sections:

**6.1** Determine vibration analysis level.

**6.2** Determine vibration impact criteria.
**Option A:** General Vibration Assessment Criteria
**Option B:** Vibration Impact Criteria for a Detailed Vibration Analysis

**6.3** Evaluate Impact: Vibration Screening Procedure
**Step 1:** Classify project vehicles.
**Step 2:** Determine project type.
**Step 3:** Determine screening distance.
**Step 4:** Identify vibration-sensitive land uses.

**6.4** Evaluate Impact: General Vibration Assessment.
**Step 1:** Select base curve for ground surface vibration level.
**Step 2:** Apply adjustments.
**Step 3:** Inventory vibration impact.

**6.5** Evaluate Impact: Detailed Vibration Analysis
**Step 1:** Characterize Existing Vibration
**Step 2:** Estimate Vibration Impact
**Step 3:** Assess Vibration Impacts
**Step 4:** Determine Vibration Mitigation Measures

A similar process for the noise impact analysis is presented in Section 4. After
the noise and vibration analyses have been completed, assess construction noise
and vibration according to Section 7 and document findings according to
Section 8.

6.1 Determine Vibration Analysis Level

There are three levels of analysis to assess the potential ground-borne vibration
and noise impacts resulting from a public transportation project. The
appropriate level of analysis varies by project based on the type and scale of the
project, the stage of project development, and its environmental setting. These
three levels are: the Vibration Screening Procedure, the General Vibration
Assessment, and the Detailed Vibration Analysis. These levels of vibration
analysis mirror the levels of noise analysis discussed in Section 4.2.

The Vibration Screening Procedure, performed first, defines the study area of
any subsequent vibration impact assessment. Where there is potential for

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 121

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

impact, the General Vibration Assessment and Detailed Vibration Analysis
procedures are used to determine the extent and severity of impact. In some
cases, a General Vibration Assessment may be all that is needed. However, if
the proposed project is near noise-sensitive land uses and it appears at the
outset that the impact would be substantial, it is prudent to conduct a Detailed
Vibration Analysis.

The methods for analyzing transit vibration are consistent with those described
in recognized handbooks and international standards. [(46)(47) ]

_Conduct the vibration screening procedure and then determine the appropriate_
_vibration analysis option:_

**Vibration Screening Procedure** - The Vibration Screening Procedure is a
simplified method of identifying the potential for vibration impact from transit
projects. The Vibration Screening Procedure is applicable to all types of transit
projects and does not require any specific knowledge about the vibration
characteristics of the system or the geology of the area. This procedure uses
simplified assumptions and considers the type of project and the presence or
absence of vibration-sensitive land uses within a screening distance that has been
developed to identify most potential vibration impacts. If no vibration-sensitive
land uses are present within the defined screening distance, then no further
vibration assessment is necessary.

The Vibration Screening Procedure steps are provided in Section 6.3, Step 1.

**General Vibration Assessment** - The General Vibration Assessment is used
to examine potential impacts to vibration-sensitive land use areas identified in
the screening step more closely. It uses generalized information likely to be
available at an early stage in the project development process and during the
development of most environmental documents.

Vibration levels at receivers are determined by estimating the overall vibration
velocity level and A-weighted ground-borne noise levels as a function of distance
from the track and applying adjustments to account for factors such as track
support systems, vehicle speed, type of building, and track and wheel conditions.

A General Vibration Assessment is sufficient for the environmental review of

many projects, including projects that compare transit modal alternatives or
relocate a crossover or turnout. The General Vibration Assessment may also be
sufficient if it results in a commitment to mitigation that eliminates the vibration
impacts, such as a change in transit mode or alignment. However, if impact is
identified through the General Vibration Assessment procedures and not
mitigated, a Detailed Vibration Analysis of the selected alternative must be
completed. Most vibration mitigation measures can only be specified after a
Detailed Vibration Analysis has been done.

The General Vibration Assessment procedure is provided in Section 6.3, Step 2.

**Detailed Vibration Analysis** - The Detailed Vibration Analysis procedure is a
comprehensive assessment method that produces the most accurate estimates

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 122

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

of vibration impact for a proposed project and is often accomplished during the
engineering phase of a project when there are sufficient data identifying
potential adverse vibration impacts from the project. However, a Detailed
Vibration Analysis may be warranted earlier in the environmental review
process if there are potentially severe impacts due to the proximity of vibrationsensitive land uses. This type of assessment requires professionals with
experience in performing and interpreting vibration propagation tests.

A Detailed Vibration Analysis may not be necessary for all segments of a
project. Generalized prediction curves from the General Vibration Assessment
procedures may be sufficient for most of the alignment, and the Detailed
Vibration Analysis procedure may only need to be applied to particularly
sensitive receivers (Section 6.3). Note that a Detailed Vibration Analysis is
typically required when designing special track-support systems such as floating
slabs or ballast mats. These and other costly vibration mitigation measures can
only be specified after a Detailed Vibration Analysis has been done in the
engineering phase of the project.

The Detailed Vibration Analysis procedure is presented in Section 6.3, Step 3.

6.2 Determine Vibration Impact Criteria

Use the FTA criteria presented in this section when conducting a General
Vibration Assessment or a Detailed Vibration Assessment. Like noise, the
sensitivity to vibration varies by land use type, and the criteria represent these
sensitivities. These criteria are based on national and international

standards, (38)(39)(48) as well as experience on human response to building
vibration. See Section 5.5 for additional background information on the
development of FTA vibration criteria. The criteria for environmental impact
from ground-borne vibration and noise are based on the maximum root­
mean-square (rms) vibration velocity levels for repeated events of the same

source.

Determine the appropriate criteria based on the level of analysis (Section 6.1).
The impact criteria for the General Vibration Assessment are presented in
Option A, and the impact criteria for the Detailed Vibration Analysis are
presented in Option B.

Option A: General Vibration Assessment Criteria
Determine the land use according to Step 1 and the frequency of events
according to Step 2. The impact criteria for the General Vibration Analysis are
presented in Step 3.

**Step 1: Land Use Categories**

_Determine the appropriate land use category for the receiver of vibration impacts of_
_the project or project segment._ Sensitive land use categories for vibration
assessment are presented in Table 6-1 in order of sensitivity. Consider indoor
use of the buildings when determining land use categories for ground-borne
vibration and noise, since impact is experienced indoors.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 123

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Table 6-1 Land Use Categories for General Vibration Assessment Impact Criteria**

|Land Use<br>Category|Land Use<br>Type|Description of Land Use Category|
|---|---|---|
|<br>-|<br> <br>Special<br>Buildings|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>~~This category includes special-use facilities that are very sensitive to vibration and~~<br>noise that are not included in the categories below and require special consideration.<br>However, if the building will rarely be occupied when the source of the vibration<br>(e.g., the train) is operating, there is no need to evaluate for impact. Examples of<br>these facilities include concert halls, TV and recording studios, and theaters.<br>|
|<br>1|<br> <br>High<br>Sensitivity|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br><br><br><br>~~This category includes buildings where vibration levels, including those below the~~<br>threshold of human annoyance, would interfere with operations within the building.<br>Examples include buildings where vibration-sensitive research and manufacturing* is<br>conducted, hospitals with vibration-sensitive equipment, and universities conducting<br>physical research operations. The building’s degree of sensitivity to vibration is<br>dependent on the specific equipment that will be affected by the vibration.<br>Equipment moderately sensitive to vibration, such as high resolution lithographic<br>equipment, optical microscopes, and electron microscopes with vibration isolation<br>systems are included in this category.** For equipment that is more sensitive, a<br>Detailed Vibration Analysis must be conducted.<br>|
|<br>2|<br>Residential|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br><br><br>~~This category includes all residential land use and buildings where people normally~~<br>sleep, such as hotels and hospitals.

|<br><br>3 <br>|<br>Institutional<br>|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>~~This category includes institutions and offices that have vibration-sensitive equipment~~<br>and have the potential for activity interference such as schools, churches, doctors’<br>offices. Commercial or industrial locations including office buildings are not included<br>in this category unless there is vibration-sensitive activity or equipment within the<br>building. As with noise, the use of the building determines the vibration sensitivity.<br>|

- Manufacturing of computer chips is an example of a vibration-sensitive process.
** Standard optical microscopes can be impacted at vibration levels below the threshold of human annoyance.
*** Even in noisy urban areas, the bedrooms will often be in quiet buildings with effective noise insulation. However, groundborne vibration and noise are experienced indoors, and building occupants have practically no means to reduce their
exposure. Therefore, occupants in noisy urban areas are just as likely to be exposed to ground-borne vibration and noise
as those in quiet suburban areas.

 - **Ground-borne Vibration** - Locations with equipment that is highlysensitive to vibration should be included in category 1 or assessed using the
Detailed Vibration Analysis procedures (Section 6.3, Step 3) and criteria
(Section 6.2, Option B) or specific criteria of the equipment manufacturer.

Most computer installations or telephone switching equipment is not
considered sensitive to vibration. Although the owners of this type of
equipment often are concerned with the potential for ground-borne
vibration interrupting smooth operation of their equipment, it is rare for
computer or other electronic equipment to be particularly sensitive to
vibration. This type of equipment is typically designed to operate in
common building environments where the equipment may experience
occasional disturbances and continuous background vibration caused by
other equipment.

 - **Ground-borne Noise** - Ground-borne noise is typically only assessed at
locations with subway or tunnel operations where there is no airborne
noise path, or for buildings with substantial sound insulation such as a
recording studio. For typical buildings with at-grade or elevated transit
operations, the interior airborne noise levels are often higher than the

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 124

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

ground-borne noise levels. For interior rooms or other special cases,
ground-borne noise may need to be assessed.

**Step 2: Identify Event Frequency**

_Determine the appropriate frequency of events for the project or project segment._

Community response to vibration correlates with the frequency of events and,
intuitively, more frequent events of low vibration levels may evoke the same
response as fewer high vibration level events. This effect is accounted for in the
ground-borne vibration and noise impact criteria by characterizing projects by
frequency of events. Event frequency definitions are presented in Table 6-2.

**Table 6-2 Event Frequency Definitions**

|Category|Definition|Typical Project Types|
|---|---|---|
|<br><br>~~Frequent Events~~<br>|<br><br>~~More than 70 events per day~~<br>|<br><br>~~Most rapid transit~~<br>|
|<br><br>~~Occasional Events~~<br>|<br><br>~~30-70 events per day~~<br>|<br><br>~~Most commuter trunk lines~~<br>|
|<br>~~Infrequent Events~~|<br>~~Fewer than 30 events per day~~|<br>~~Most commuter rail branch lines~~|

**Step 3: Apply Impact Criteria by Land Use and Event**
**Frequency**

Select the appropriate impact criteria for ground-borne vibration and noise
based on the previously identified land use categories and frequency of events. It
is also important to consider the time of vibration sensitivity. If the building is
not typically occupied when the vibration source (e.g., train) is operating, it is
not necessary to consider impact.

The criteria in this section are appropriate for assessing human annoyance or
interference with vibration-sensitive equipment for common projects. While not
typical, existing conditions, freight train operations, and building damage may
require consideration.

 - **Existing Conditions** - The criteria in this section do not consider existing
conditions. In most cases, the existing environment does not include a
substantial number of perceptible ground-borne vibration or noise events.
However, existing conditions must be evaluated in some cases, such as for
projects located in an existing rail corridor. For criteria considering existing
conditions, see Step 3b.

 - **Freight Train Operations** - The criteria are primarily based on
experience with passenger train operations. Passenger train operations
(rapid transit, commuter rail, and intercity passenger railroad) create
vibration events that last approximately 10 seconds or less while a typical
line-haul freight train event lasts approximately two minutes. This manual is
oriented to transit projects. However, situations will occur when freight
train operations must be evaluated, such as when freight train tracks are
relocated for a transit project within a railroad ROW. Guidelines on
applying these criteria to freight train operations are presented in Step 3c.

 - **Building Damage** - Itisextremely rare for vibration from train
operations to cause substantial or even minor cosmetic building damage.
However, damage to fragile historic buildings located near the ROW may be
of concern. Even in these cases, damage is unlikely except when the track is
located very close to the structure. Damage thresholds that apply to these
structures are discussed in Section 7.2, Step 4 on Construction Vibration
Impacts.

**3a. Choose the impact criteria by land use category and event**
**frequency.** The criteria for ground-borne vibration and noise land use
categories 1-3 are presented in Table 6-3. The criteria are presented in terms of
acceptable indoor ground-borne vibration and noise levels. Impact will occur if
these levels are exceeded. Criteria for ground-borne vibration are expressed in
terms of rms velocity levels in VdB, and criteria for ground-borne noise are
expressed in terms of A-weighted sound pressure levels in dBA.

- This criterion limit is based on levels that are acceptable for most moderately sensitive equipment such as optical
microscopes. For equipment that is more sensitive, a Detailed Vibration Analysis must be performed.
** Vibration-sensitive equipment is generally not sensitive to ground-borne noise; however, the manufacturer’s
specifications should be reviewed for acoustic and vibration sensitivity.

The criteria for ground-borne vibration and noise for special land uses are
presented in Table 6-4. The criteria are presented in terms of acceptable indoor
ground-borne vibration and noise levels. Impact will occur if these levels are
exceeded. As for the other land uses, the criteria for ground-borne vibration
are expressed in terms of rms velocity levels in VdB, and criteria for groundborne noise are expressed in terms of sound pressure levels in dBA.

**3b. Consider the presence of existing vibration conditions.**
When the project will cause vibration more than 5 dB above the existing
vibration, the existing source can be ignored, and the standard vibration
criteria in Step 3a are appropriate. When the project will cause vibration less
than 5 dB above the existing vibration level, use the instructions presented in
this section to determine the appropriate impact criteria for the project. For
information on characterizing existing vibration conditions, see Section 6.2,
Step 3.

Use Table 6-5 and Figure 6-1 to determine the appropriate impact criteria.
Sources of existing vibration are typically longer in duration than the events
introduced into the environment due to the project. The frequency of use in the
rail corridor is also a factor in characterizing the existing conditions. Both
factors are considered in the process of determining appropriate impact criteria
in Table 6-5 and Figure 6-1.
Examples of projects considering the existing vibration conditions in Table 6-5
and Figure 6-1 include:

 - An automated people mover system planned for a corridor with an
existing rapid transit service with 220 trains per day that did not have a
significant increase in events from the existing 220 trains per day and
that is not 3 dB above the existing vibration level would cause no
additional impact.

 - Where a new commuter rail line shares a heavily-used corridor with a
rapid transit system, the project vibration exceeds the existing vibration
level, there is not a significant increase in the number of events, and the
project vibration exceeds the existing vibration level by 3 dB or more,
the projected vibration levels must be evaluated using the standard
impact criteria to determine impact.

 - If a new transit project will use an existing railroad ROW and the
location of existing railroad tracks are shifted, existing vibration can be
substantial. The track relocation and reconstruction can result in lower

vibration levels that would benefit the receivers and not introduce any
adverse impact. However, if the track relocation causes higher vibration
levels at vibration-sensitive receivers, then the projected vibration levels
must be evaluated using the standard impact criteria to determine
impact.

**3c. Apply criteria to freight trainsifpart of the project.**
Use the criteria presented in Step 3a to assess the vibration from freight trains
in shared ROW scenarios because no specific impact criteria exist for freight
railroads. It is important to consider that freight operations occur over
substantially greater distances than passenger train operations and have different
weight and axle loads.

When assessing vibration from freight train operations, consider the locomotive
and rail car vibration separately. Since locomotive vibration lasts for a very short
time, it can be characterized by the infrequent events category in Table 6-2. Rail
car vibration from a typical line-haul freight train usually lasts for several minutes
and can be characterized by the frequent events category in Table 6-2. Note

xii Vibration is abbreviated as “vib.” in this flowchart.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 129

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

that locomotives often create vibration levels that are 3 to 8 dB higher than
those created by rail cars.

Use good engineering judgment to confirm the approach is reasonable for each
project. For example, some spur rail lines carry very little rail traffic (sometimes
only one train per week) or have short trains, in which case it may not be
necessary to evaluate for impact. If there is uncertainty in how to determine the
appropriate criteria, contact the FTA Regional office.

Decisions to relocate freight tracks closer to vibration-sensitive sites should be
made with the understanding that increased vibration due to freight rail may not
be possible to mitigate. Freight rail vibration may not always be successfully
mitigated by the same methods as rail transit systems.

**Option B: Vibration Impact Criteria for a Detailed Vibration**
**Analysis**

Determine the appropriate impact criteria for ground-borne vibration and
ground-borne noise for a Detailed Vibration Analysis.

**Step 1: Ground-Borne Vibration**

_Choose the appropriate criteria based on Figure 6-2 and Table 6-6._

Ground-borne vibration criteria presented in this section are more detailed
than in the General Vibration Assessment. The criteria are based on
international standards for the effects of vibration on people related to
annoyance and interference with activities in buildings [(39) ] as well as industry
standards for vibration-sensitive equipment. [(46) ] The criteria in this section are
used to assess the potential for interference or annoyance from building
response and to determine performance of vibration reduction methods. Note
that for highly-sensitive equipment, specific vibration criteria provided by the
manufacturer supersede the criteria in this section.

The criteria are presented by category in Figure 6-2 and are defined by
international and industry standards. [(39)(46) ] These criteria define limits for
acceptable maximum rms vibration velocity level with a one-second averaging
time at the floor of the receiving building in terms of a one-third octave band
frequency spectrum. Band levels that exceed a particular criterion curve indicate
impact; and therefore, mitigation options should be evaluated considering the
specific frequency range in which the treatment is most effective. Interpretations
of the criteria are presented in Table 6-6.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 131

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

In addition to the uses described in Table 6-6, the detailed vibration criteria can
be applied to the three land use categories presented in Table 6-3.

 - For residential land uses (category 2), use the residential night criterion
curve in Table 6-6.

 - For institutional uses (category 3), use the residential day criterion
curve in Table 6-6.

 - For category 1, the specific use of the building should be matched to the
appropriate criterion curve in Table 6-6.

 - For special buildings, such as those found in Table 6-4, either the criteria
in Table 6-4 or specific criteria presented by the building operator
should be used.

These criteria use a frequency spectrum because vibration-related problems
generally occur due to resonances of the structural components of a building or
vibration-sensitive equipment. Resonant response is frequency-dependent. A
Detailed Vibration Analysis can provide an assessment that identifies potential
problems resulting from resonances.

The detailed vibration criteria are based on generic cases when people are
standing or equipment is mounted on the floor in a conventional manner.
Consequently, the criteria are less stringent at very low frequencies below 8 Hz.
Where special vibration isolation has been provided in the form of pneumatic
isolators, the resonant frequency of the isolation system is very low.
Consequently, in this special case, the curves may be extended flat at lower
frequencies.

**Step 2: Ground-borne Noise**

Ground-borne noise impacts are assessed based on criteria for human
annoyance and activity interference. The Detailed Vibration Analysis procedure
provides vibration spectra inside a building. To evaluate ground-borne noise,
convert these vibration spectra to sound pressure level spectra in the occupied
spaces using the method described in Section 6.5 and compare to the criteria as
follows:

 - For residential buildings, use the criteria presented in Table 6-3.

 - For special buildings listed in Table 6-4, A-weighted noise may not be
sufficient to assess activity interference for a Detailed Vibration Analysis.
Each special building may have a unique specification for acceptable
noise levels and criteria must be determined on a case-by-case basis.
For example, a recording studio may have stringent requirements for
allowable noise in each frequency band.

6.3 Evaluate Impact: Vibration Screening

Procedure

_Determine the potential for impact using the Vibration Screening Procedure by_
_identifying any vibration-sensitive land uses (Table 6-1) within the appropriate_
_screening distance._

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 132

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Figure 6-3 Flow Chart of Vibration Screening Process**

**Step 1: Classify Project Vehicles**

_Determine the project type and the next step based on the guidelines below._

**Option A: No Vehicles** - Transit projects that do not involve vehicles do not
have potential for vibration impact and do not require further analysis (Box A in
Figure 6-3).

Many smaller FTA-funded projects, such as bus terminals, park-and-ride lots,
and station rehabilitation are in this category, and do not require further analysis
of ground-borne vibration impact. However, if track systems are modified (e.g.,
tracks moved or switches modified), _proceed to Step 2_ **.**

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 133

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Option B: Steel-wheeled/Steel-rail Vehicles** - Transit projects with steelwheeled/steel-rail vehicles have potential for vibration impact (Box B in Figure
6-3); _proceed to Step 2_ . These rail systems include urban rapid transit, LRT,
commuter rail, and steel-wheel intermediate capacity transit (ICT) systems.

**Option C: Rubber-tire Vehicles** - For projects that involve rubber-tire
vehicles and do not meet the following conditions, vibration impact is unlikely,
and no further analysis is needed. _Proceed to Step 2_ for projects that involve
rubber-tire vehicles and meet the following conditions (Box A in Figure 6.3):

 - **Roadway irregularity** - Expansion joints, speed bumps, or other
design features that result in unevenness in the road surface can result
in perceptible ground-borne vibration at distances up to 75 ft away.

 - **Operation close to vibration-sensitive buildings** - Buses, trucks,
or other heavy vehicles operating close to a vibration-sensitive building
(within approximately 100 ft from the property line) may impact
vibration-sensitive activities, such as research that uses electron
microscopes or manufacturing of computer chips.

 - **Vehicles operating within buildings** - Special considerations are
often required for shared use facilities where vehicles operate inside or
directly underneath buildings such bus stations located inside an office
building complex.

**Step 2: Determine Project Type**

_Determine the project type according to Table 6-7._

|<br>2|<br>RRT|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>~~Ground-borne vibration impact from rapid transit trains is one of the major~~<br>environmental issues for new systems.

Examples include diesel buses, electric trolley buses, and<br>rubber-tired people movers. Most projects that do not include steel-wheel<br>trains do not cause vibration impacts.**<br>|

*See the screening distances for category 1 land uses in Table 6-8.
****** Most complaints about vibration caused by buses and trucks are related to rattling of windows or items hung on the walls.
These vibrations are usually the result of airborne noise and not ground-borne vibration. In the case where ground-borne
vibration is the source of the complaint, the vibration can usually be attributed to irregularities in the road.

**Step 3: Determine Screening Distance**

_Determine the appropriate screening distances based on land use and project type_
_according to Table 6-8._

The distances are based on the criteria presented in Section 6.3, the procedures
in Section 6.4 assuming normal vibration propagation, and include a 5-dB factor
of safety. Even so, areas with very efficient vibration propagation can have
substantially higher vibration levels.

Because of the 5-decibel safety factor, the screening distances will identify most
of the potentially impacted areas, even for areas with efficient propagation.
However, when there is evidence of efficient propagation, such as previous
complaints about existing transit facilities or a history of problems with
construction vibration, increase the distances in Table 6-8 by a factor of 1.5.

*For the Vibration Screening Procedure, evaluate special buildings as follows: Category 1 - concert halls and TV
studios, Category 2 - theaters and auditoriums

**Step 4: Identify Vibration-Sensitive Land Uses**

Identify all vibration-sensitive land uses (Table 6-1) within the chosen screening
distance. If no vibration-sensitive land uses are identified, no further vibration
analysis is needed. If one or more of the vibration-sensitive land uses are in the
screening distance, complete a General Vibration Assessment (Section 6.4) or a
Detailed Vibration Analysis (Section 6.5).

6.4 Evaluate Impact: General Vibration

Assessment

_Evaluate for impact using the General Vibration Assessment procedure ifthe Vibration_
_Screening Procedure (Section 6.3) identified vibration-sensitive receivers within the_
_screening distance of the transit vibration source_ .

For guidelines on when the General Vibration Assessment is appropriate,
review Section 6.1.

The basic approach for the General Vibration Assessment is to define a curve or
set of curves that predicts the overall ground-borne vibration as a function of
distance from the source, then apply adjustments to these curves to account for
factors such as vehicle speed, geologic conditions, building type, and receiver
location within the building. When the vehicle type is not covered by the curves
included in this section, it will be necessary to define an appropriate curve
either by extrapolating from existing information or performing measurements
at an existing facility.

**Step 1: Select Base Curve for Ground Surface Vibration**

**Level**

_Select a standard vibration curve to represent general vibration characteristics for the_

_source._

The curves presented in Figure 6-4 are based on measurements of groundborne vibration at representative North American transit systems and can be
used to represent vibration characteristics for standard transportation systems
in the General Vibration Assessment.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 136

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

These curves assume typical ground-borne vibration levels, equipment in good
condition, and speeds of 50 mph for the rail systems and 30 mph for buses.
Adjustments to account for differences in speed and geologic conditions are
included in Step 2.

Select a base curve from Figure 6-4 according to the guidelines in Table 6-9.
Equations for the curves in Figure 6-4 are included in Table 6-10. Additional
considerations for selecting a base curve for systems not included in Table 6-9
are presented below by transit mode.

 - **Intercity passenger trains** - Although intercity passenger trains can
be an important source of environmental vibration, it is rare that they
are considered for FTA-funded projects unless a new transit mode uses
an existing rail alignment. When a new transit line uses an existing rail
alignment, changes in the intercity passenger traffic can result in either
positive or negative impacts. Use the locomotive-powered passenger or
freight curve for intercity passenger trains unless there are specific data
available on the ground-borne vibration created by the new train
operations.

 - **Locomotive-powered commuter rail** - Use the locomotivepowered passenger or freight curve for all commuter rail system
powered by either diesel or electric locomotives.

 - **Electric multiple unit (EMU)** - Use the rapid transit or light rail
vehicles curve for self-powered electric commuter rail trains.

 - **Diesel multiple unit (DMU)** - Self-powered DMUs create vibration
levels somewhere between rapid transit vehicles and locomotivepowered passenger trains. A vibration curve for DMUs can be
estimated by lowering the locomotive-powered passenger or freight
curve by 5 dB.

 - **Subway heavy rail or light rail** - Use the rapid transit or light rail
vehicles curve for subway heavy rail and subway light rail. Although
vibrations from subway and at-grade tracks have very different
characteristics, the overall vibration velocity levels are comparable.
When applied to subways, the rapid transit or light rail vehicles curve
assumes a relatively lightweight bored concrete tunnel in soil. The
vibration levels will be lower for heavier subway structures such as cut­
and-cover box structures and stations.

 - **At-grade heavy rail or light rail** - Use the rapid transit or light rail
vehicles curve for at-grade heavy rail or light rail. Heavy rail and LRT
vehicles have similar suspension systems and axle loads and create
similar levels of ground-borne vibration.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 138

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

 - **Elevated guideways or aerial structures** - Vibration from
operations on an elevated structure is typically not an issue unless the
guideway is supported by a building or located very close to buildings.
Apply the appropriate adjustment for the aerial structures (Section 6.4,
Step 2).

 - **Streetcars** - Use the rapid transit or light rail vehicles curve for street

cars.

 - **ICT** - Use the rapid transit or light rail vehicles curve for ICT systems
with steel wheels and the rubber-tired vehicles curve for ICT systems
with rubber tires.

 - **Other vehicle types** - For less common modes such as magneticallylevitated vehicles (maglev), monorail, or AGT, use good engineering
judgment to choose a standard curve to best fit the mode or if a new
curve needs to be developed, as a function of distance from the track.
Examples include:
 Vibration from a rubber-tire monorail operating on aerial
guideway can be approximated using the rubber-tired vehicles
curve with the appropriate adjustment for the aerial structure
(Section 6.4, Step 2).
 Most of the data available on the noise and vibration
characteristics of maglev vehicles comes from high-speed
systems intended for inter-city service. Even though there is no
direct contact between the vehicle and the guideway, the
dynamic loads on the guideway can generate ground-borne
vibration. Measurements on a German high-speed maglev
resulted in ground-borne vibrations at 75 mph which is
comparable to the base curve for rubber-tired vehicles at 30
mph. [(49) ]

**Step 2: Apply Adjustments**

_Apply project-specific adjustments to the standard vibration curve._

Once the base curve has been selected, use the adjustments in the following
instructions to develop project-specific vibration projections at each receiver.
All adjustments are given as single numbers to add to, or subtract from, the
base level.

Adjustments are separated by source, path, and receiver and include speed,
wheel and rail type and condition, type of track support system, type of building
foundation, and number of floors above the basement level. Calculate the
appropriate adjustments to the base level. An example of the General Vibration
Assessment is provided at the end of this Section.

It should be recognized that many of these adjustments are strongly dependent
on the frequency spectrum of the vibration source and the frequency
dependence of the vibration propagation. The adjustments in this section are
suitable for generalized evaluation of the vibration impact and vibration

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 139

mitigation measures because they are based on typical vibration spectra.
However, these adjustments are not adequate for detailed evaluations of impact
of vibration-sensitive buildings or for detailed specification of mitigation

measures.

**2a.** Apply source adjustments to the base curve using Table 6-11 and the
descriptions below to account for the project-specific source characteristics.

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

In addition to the comments in Table 6-11, use the following guidelines to select
the appropriate adjustment factors. Some adjustments in the same category are
not cumulative (additive) and only the greatest applicable adjustment should be
applied. The adjustments that are not additive are noted in Table 6-11 and in the
descriptions below. Note that some adjustments are not additive across
multiple categories and are noted in the comments of Table 6-11. For example,
the adjustment for a vehicle with stiff primary suspension is 8 dB, and the
adjustment for wheel flats is 10 dB. If the vehicle has a stiff primary suspension
and has wheel flats, the projected vibration levels should be increased by 10 dB,
not 18 dB.

In addition, some vibration control measures are targeted for specific frequency
ranges. The shape of the actual vibration spectra should be considered so that
an appropriate vibration control measure may be selected.

 - **Speed** - The levels of ground-borne vibration and noise vary,
approximately, as 20 times the logarithm of speed. This means that
doubling train speed will increase the vibration levels approximately 6
dB, and halving train speed will reduce the levels by 6 dB. The
adjustments in Table 6-11 have been tabulated for reference vehicle
speeds of 30 mph for rubber-tired vehicles and 50 mph for steel-wheel
vehicles. Use the following relationship to calculate the adjustments for
other speeds.

෵ෲ෧෧෦ ෬ෟ෠
vehicle has been obtained, use Eq. 6-4 .

 - **Vehicle Parameters** - The most important factors for the vehicles
are the suspension system, wheel condition, and wheel type. Most new
heavy rail and light rail vehicles have relatively soft primary suspensions.
However, a stiff primary suspension (vertical resonance frequency
greater than 15 Hz) can result in higher levels of ground-borne vibration
than soft primary suspensions. Vehicles, for which the primary
suspension consists of rubber or neoprene around the axle bearing,
usually have a very stiff primary suspension with a vertical resonance
frequency greater than 40 Hz or more.

Deteriorated wheel condition is another factor that increases vibration

levels. It can be assumed that a new system has vehicles with wheels in
good condition. When older vehicles are used on new track, it is
important to consider the condition of the wheels, and it may be
appropriate to include an adjustment for the wheel condition.

Resilient wheels will reduce vibration levels at frequencies greater than
the effective resonance frequency of the wheel. When this resonance

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 141

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

frequency is relatively high, greater than 80 Hz, resilient wheels may
only have a marginal effect on ground-borne vibration.

The adjustments in this category are not additive; apply the greatest
applicable value only.

 - **Track Conditions** - This category includes the type of rail (welded,
jointed, or special trackwork), the track support system, and the
condition of the rail. The base curves assume welded rail in good
condition. Jointed rail causes higher vibration levels than welded rail and
the increase depends on the condition of the joints.

Wheel impacts at special trackwork, such as frogs at crossovers, create
much higher vibration forces than typical track conditions. Because of
the higher vibration levels at special trackwork, crossovers are the
principal areas of vibration impact on new systems. Methods of
mitigating the vibration impact include modifying the track support
system, installing low-impact frogs, or relocating the crossover. Special
track support systems such as ballast mats, high-resilience track
fasteners, resiliently supported ties, and floating slabs have all been
shown to be effective in reducing vibration levels.

The condition of the running surface of the rails can strongly affect
vibration levels. Factors such as corrugations, general wear, or mill scale
on new track can cause vibration levels 5 to 15 dB higher than normal.
Mill scale will typically wear away after some time in service, but the
track must be ground to remove corrugations or to reduce the
roughness from wear.

Roadway surfaces in the rubber-tired vehicle base curve are assumed to
be smooth. Rough washboard surfaces, bumps, or uneven expansion
joints are the types of running surface defects that cause increased
vibration levels over the smooth road condition.

The adjustments in this category are not additive; apply the greatest
applicable value only. If there are adjustments for vehicle parameters
and the track is worn or corrugated, only include one adjustment.

**2b.** Apply path adjustments to the base curve using Table 6-12 and the
descriptions below to account for the project-specific path characteristics.

In addition to the comments in Table 6-12, use the following guidelines to
select the appropriate adjustment factors.

- **Track Structure** - The weight and size of a transit structure affects
the vibration radiated by that structure. In general, vibration levels are
lower for heavier transit structures. Therefore, the vibration levels from
a cut-and-cover concrete double-box subway can be assumed to be
lower than the vibration from a lightweight concrete-lined bored tunnel.

The vibration from elevated structures is lower than from at-grade
track because of the mass and damping of the structure and the extra
distance that the vibration must travel before it reaches the receiver.
Elevated structures in AGT applications are sometimes designed to bear
on building elements. This is a special case and may require detailed
design considerations.

The adjustments in this category are not additive; apply the greatest
applicable value only.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 143

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

- **Ground-Borne Propagation Effects-** **Geologic Conditions** -
Although it is known that geologic conditions have a considerable effect
on the vibration levels, it is rarely possible to develop more than a
general understanding of the vibration propagation characteristics for a
General Vibration Assessment. One of the challenges with identifying
the cause of efficient propagation is the difficulty in determining whether
higher than normal vibration levels are due to geologic conditions or
due to special source conditions (e.g., rail corrugations or wheel flats).

Some geologic conditions are repeatedly associated with efficient
propagation. Shallow bedrock, less than 30 ft below the surface, is likely
to have efficient propagation. Soil type and stiffness are also important
factors in determining propagation characteristics. In particular, stiff,
clayey soils, consolidated sand, gravel, and glacial till can be associated
with efficient vibration propagation. Investigation of soil boring records
can be used to estimate depth to bedrock and the presence of problem
soil conditions.

A conservative approach would be to use the 10-dB adjustment for
efficient propagation for areas where efficient propagation is likely.
However, this adjustment can greatly overstate the potential for
vibration impact where efficient propagation is not present and should
be applied using good judgment. Review available geological data and any
complaint history from existing transit lines and major construction
sites near the transit corridor to identify areas where efficient
propagation is possible. If there is reason to suspect efficient
propagation conditions, conduct a Detailed Vibration Analysis during the
engineering phase and include vibration propagation tests at the areas
with potential for efficient propagation.

- **Track Structure and Geologic Conditions** - **Examples**
 **Subway**
For a subway, determine if the subway will be founded in bedrock.
Bedrock is considered to be hard rock. It is usually appropriate to
consider soft siltstone and sandstone to be more like soil than hard
rock. Whether a subway is founded in soil or rock can make a 15­
dB difference in the vibration levels.

When a subway structure is founded in rock, include the following
Track Structure and Ground-borne Propagation Effects adjustments
from Table 6-12:

```
 ­
```

Type of Transit Structure adjustment: Rock-based - 15 dB

```
 ­
```
Geologic Conditions adjustment: Propagation in rock layer
for the appropriate distance.

This adjustment increases with distance because vibration
attenuates more slowly in rock than in the soil used as a basis for
the reference curve.

- **At-grade** - When considering at-grade vibration sources, determine if
the vibration propagation characteristics are typical or efficient. Efficient

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 144

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

vibration propagation results in vibration levels approximately 10 dB
higher than typical levels. This more than doubles the potential impact
zone for ground-borne vibration.

 - **Ground-Borne Propagation Effects-** **Coupling to Building**
**Foundation** - Since annoyance from ground-borne vibration and noise
is an indoor phenomenon, the effects of the building structure on the
vibration must be considered. Wood-frame buildings, such as typical
residential structures, are more easily excited by ground vibration than
heavier buildings. In contrast, large masonry buildings with spread
footings have a low response to ground vibration.

When a building foundation is directly on the rock layer, there is no
coupling loss due to the weight and stiffness of the building. Use the
standard coupling factors based on building type if there is at least a 10­
foot layer of soil between the building foundation and the rock layer.

**2c.** Apply receiver adjustments to the base curve using Table 6-13 and the
descriptions below to account for the project-specific receiver characteristics.
The data in Table 6-13 is applicable when the building structural features are
known.

For more generic cases that do not have detailed information on individual
buildings, use a conservative approach and apply the following adjustments to
predict indoor vibration based on the outdoor vibration, instead of using the
adjustments in Table 6-13: [(43)(50) ]

 - Light-weight, wood-frame construction 1st floor: +3 dB

 - Light-weight, wood-frame construction 2nd and 3rd floors: +6 dB

 - Large buildings: 0 dB

 - Small masonry buildings: +3 dB

**Table 6-13 Receiver Adjustment Factors for Generalized Predictions of GB Vibration and Noise**

 - Floor-to-floor attenuation adjustments for the first floor assume a basement.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 145

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

In addition to the comments in Table 6-13, use the following guidelines to select
the appropriate adjustment factors. Note that receiver adjustments are additive.

 - Vibration generally reduces in level as it propagates through a building.
As indicated in Table 6-13, a 1- to 2-decibel attenuation per floor is
typically appropriate.

 - Resonances of the building structure, particularly the floors, will cause
some amplification of the vibration. Consequently, for a wood-frame
structure, the building-related adjustments nearly cancel out. Example:
All adjustments for the first floor assuming a basement are: -5 dB for
the coupling loss; -2 dB for the propagation from the basement to the
first floor; and +6 dB for the floor amplification. The total adjustment in
this case is -1 dB.

**2d.** Apply adjustments to the final adjusted curve using Table 6-14 and the
descriptions below to convert ground-borne vibration levels to ground-borne

noise levels.

**Table 6-14 Conversion to Ground-borne Noise**

|Conversion to Ground-borne Noise|Col2|Col3|

Estimate the levels of radiated noise using the average vibration amplitude of the
room surfaces (floors, walls, and ceiling), and the total acoustical absorption in
the room.

The un-weighted sound pressure level is approximately 5 dB [(37)(43) ] less than the
vibration velocity level when the velocity level is referenced to 1x10 [-6 ]
inches/sec; but for a better estimate, it is necessary to consider general
frequency ranges. Since ground-borne noise is A-weighted, the adjustments vary
by frequency range, as described below. See Appendix B.1.4.1 for more
information on A-weighting.

To select the appropriate adjustment, classify the frequency characteristics
according to the guidelines below.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 146

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

 - **Low Frequency (<30 Hz)** - Low-frequency vibration characteristics
can be assumed for the following conditions:
 Subways surrounded by cohesionless sandy soil
 Vibration isolation track support systems
 Most surface track

 - **Mid Frequency (peak 30 to 60 Hz)** - The mid-frequency vibration
characteristic can be assumed for the following conditions:
 Subways, unless other information indicates that one of the other
assumptions is appropriate,
 Surface track when the soil is very stiff with high clay content

 - **High Frequency (>60 Hz)** - High-frequency characteristics can be
assumed for the following conditions:
 Subways with the transit structure founded in rock
 Subways, when there is very stiff, clayey soil

**Step 3: Inventory of Vibration Impact**

_Take inventory of vibration-sensitive land uses with impact and determine if a Detailed_
_Vibration Analysis is required._

Compare the projected vibration levels, including all appropriate adjustments in
Section 6.4, Step 2, to the criteria to determine if impact from ground-borne
vibration or noise is likely. Note that for any transit mode, variation in vibration
levels under apparently similar conditions is not uncommon. In the General
Vibration Assessment, it is preferable to make a conservative assessment of the
impact and include buildings that may ultimately not be subject to impact.

The standard curves in Section 6.4, Step 1, represent the upper range of
vibration levels from well-maintained systems. Although actual levels fluctuate
widely, it is rare that ground-borne vibration will exceed these curves by more
than 1 or 2 dB unless there are extenuating circumstances such as wheel- or
running-surface defects. However, because actual levels of ground-borne
vibration will sometimes differ substantially from the projections, use the
following guidelines to interpret vibration impact:

- **Projected vibrationisbelow the impact threshold** - Vibration impact
is unlikely, and the environmental document should state this.

- **Projected ground-borne vibration is 0 to 5 dB greater than the**
**impact threshold** - There is a strong chance that actual ground-borne
vibration levels will be below the impact threshold. The environmental
document should report impact at these locations as exceeding the
applicable threshold, present possible mitigation measures and costs, and
commit to conducting more detailed studies to refine the vibration impact
analysis during the engineering phase. During the Detailed Vibration
Analysis, determine appropriate mitigation, if necessary. A site-specific
Detailed Vibration Analysis may show that vibration impacts will not occur
and control measures are not needed.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 147

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

 - **Projected ground-borne vibration is 5 dB or greater than the**
**impact threshold** - Vibration impact is probable and Detailed Vibration
Analysis must be conducted during the engineering phase to determine
appropriate vibration control measures. The environmental document
should report impact at these locations as exceeding the applicable
threshold, present possible mitigation measures and costs, and commit to
conducting more detailed studies to refine the vibration impact analysis
during the engineering phase. During the Detailed Vibration Analysis,
determine appropriate mitigation, if necessary. A site-specific, Detailed
Vibration Analysis may show that very costly vibration mitigation must be
incorporated into the project to eliminate the impacts.

FTA recommends the reporting of a vibration level as a single value and not as a
range, as ranges tend to confuse the interpretation of impact.

Express the results of the General Vibration Assessment in terms of an
inventory with the following components:

 - Include all vibration-sensitive land uses as identified in the Vibration
Screening Procedure.

 - Organize the inventory according to the categories described in Table
6-8.

 - Include information on potentially feasible mitigation measures to
reduce vibration to acceptable levels based on the generalized reduction
estimates provided in this section. To be considered feasible, the
measure or combination of measures must provide at least a 5-dB
reduction of the vibration levels and be reasonable in terms of cost.

These potential mitigation measures are considered preliminary. Final vibration
mitigation measures can only be specified after a Detailed Vibration Analysis has
been done; see Section 6.5 for more information. Vibration control is
frequency-dependent; therefore, specific recommendations of vibration control
measures can only be made after evaluating the frequency characteristics of the
vibration.

6.5 Evaluate Impact: Detailed Vibration Analysis

_Evaluate for impact using the Detailed Vibration Analysis procedure, if appropriate_
_(Section 6.1)._

The goal of the Detailed Vibration Analysis is to use all available tools to
develop accurate projections of potential ground-borne vibration impact and
when necessary, to design mitigation measures. A Detailed Vibration Analysis
requires developing estimates of the frequency components of the vibration
signal, usually in terms of 1/3-octave-band spectra. The analytical techniques for
solving vibration problems are complex, and the technology continually
advances. Therefore, the approach presented in this section focuses on the key
steps for these analyses. The key elements of the Detailed Vibration Analysis
procedure and recommended steps are described below.

The methods in this section generally assume a steel-wheel/rail system. The
procedures could be adapted to bus systems. However, this is rarely necessary
because vibration impact is very infrequent with rubber-tired transit.

In general, when situations arise that are not explicitly covered in the Detailed
Vibration Analysis, professional judgment may be used to extend these methods
to cover these unique cases, when appropriate. Appendix G provides
information on developing and using non-standard modeling procedures.

**Step 1: Characterize Existing Vibration Conditions**

_Conduct measurements to survey and document the existing vibration conditions_ .

In contrast to noise impact analysis, the existing ambient vibration is not
required to assess vibration impact in most cases; but, it is important to

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 149

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

document general background vibration in the project corridor. Because the
existing environmental vibration is usually below human perception, a limited
vibration survey is sufficient even for a Detailed Vibration Analysis.

It is particularly valuable to survey vibration conditions at sensitive locations for
the following reasons:

 - To obtain valuable information on the true sensitivity of the activity to
external vibration and obtain a reference condition under which

vibration is not problematic.

 - To document that existing vibration levels are above or below the
normal threshold of human perception for the existing condition.

 - To document levels of vibration created by existing rail lines. If vibration
from an existing rail line is higher than the proposed train, there may
not be impact even if the standard impact criteria are exceeded.

 - To use existing vibration sources to characterize propagation. Existing
vibration sources such as freight trains, industrial processes, quarrying
operations, or normal traffic can be used to characterize vibration
propagation. Carefully designed and performed measurements may
eliminate the need for more complex propagation tests. See Appendix
G for information on using non-standard modeling procedures.

 - To identify the potential for efficient vibration propagation. If a
measurement site has existing vibration approaching the range of human
perception (e.g., the maximum vibration velocity levels are greater than
about 65 VdB), then this site should be carefully evaluated for the
possibility of efficient vibration propagation.

Conduct measurements to characterize existing vibration conditions. The goal
of most ambient vibration measurements is to characterize the rms vertical
vibration velocity level at the ground surface. In almost all cases, it is sufficient to
measure only vertical vibration and ignore the transverse components of the
vibration. Although transverse components [(51) ] can transmit vibration energy into
a building, the vertical component typically dominates.

**1a. Choose Measurement Locations** - Conduct outdoor and/or indoor

measurements to characterize existing vibration conditions, as appropriate,
for the project. Although ground-borne vibration is almost exclusively a
problem inside buildings, it is generally recommended to perform
measurements outdoors because equipment inside the building may cause
more vibration than exterior sources. Additionally, the building structure
and the resonances of the building can have strong effects on the vibration
that are difficult to predict. It can also be important to measure and
document those indoor sources of vibration. These indoor sources may
cause vibration greater than that due to external sources like street traffic
or aircraft overflights. When measuring (indoor) floor vibration, take
measurements near the center of a floor span where the vibration
amplitudes are the highest.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 150

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**1b. Measurement Considerations**

 - **Site selection** - Selecting sites for an ambient vibration survey
requires good judgment. Sites selected to characterize a transit corridor
should be distributed along the entire project where potential for
impacts have been identified and should be representative of the types
of vibration environments found in the corridor. This would commonly
include:
 Measurements in quiet, residential areas removed from major traffic
arterials to characterize low-ambient vibration areas;
 Measurements along major traffic arterials and highways or freeways
to characterize high-ambient vibration areas;
 Measurements in any area with vibration-sensitive activities; and
 Measurements at any major existing source of vibration such as
railroad lines.

 - **Transducer placement** - Place the transducers near the building
setback line. For ambient measurements along railroad lines, it is
recommended to include:

 Multiple sites at several distances from the rail line at each site, and
 4 to 10 train passbys for each test.

Because of the irregular schedule for freight trains and the low number
of operations each day, it is often impractical to perform tests at more
than two or three sites along the rail line or to measure more than two
or three passbys at each site.

Rail type and condition strongly affect the vibration levels.
Consequently, it is important to inspect the track to locate any
switches, bad rail joints, corrugations, or other factors that could be
responsible for higher than normal vibration levels. Locations with these
kinds of irregularities should be represented in addition to locations
with rail in better condition.

 - **Transducer mounting methods** - The way a transducer is mounted
can affect the measured levels of ground-borne vibration.
 Straightforward methods of mounting transducers on the ground
surface or on pavement are adequate for vertical vibration
measurements for the frequencies of concern for ground-borne
vibration (less than about 200 Hz).
 Quick-drying epoxy, clay, or beeswax can be used to mount
transducers to smooth paved surfaces or metal stakes driven into
the ground.
 Rough concrete or rock surfaces require special mountings. One
approach is to use a liberal base of epoxy to attach small aluminum
blocks to the surface, and then mount the transducers on the

aluminum blocks.
 When in doubt, review the specific transducer documentation and
discuss additional mounting guidance with the transducer
manufacturer.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 151

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**1c. Existing Vibration Characterization** - The appropriate methods of
characterizing ambient vibration are dependent on the type of information
required for the analysis. Consider the following when characterizing the
existing vibration:

 - **Ambient vibration** - Ambient vibration is usually characterized with a
continuous 10- to 30-minute measurement of vibration. The rms
velocity level of the vibration velocity level over the measurement
period provides an indication of the average vibration energy. The rms
velocity level over the measurement period is typically equivalent to a
long averaging time rms level.

 - **Specific events** - Characterize specific events such as train passbys by
the rms level over the time that the train passes by. If the locomotives
produce vibration levels more than 5 dB higher than the passenger or
freight cars, obtain a separate rms level for the locomotives. The
locomotives can usually be characterized by the L max during the train
passby. The rms averaging time or time constant should be 1 second
when determining L max . In some cases, it may be adequate to
characterize the train passby using L max, which is simpler to obtain than
the rms averaged over the entire train passby.

 - **Spectral analysis** - Perform a spectral analysis of vibration
propagation data. For example, if vibration transmission of the ground is
suspected of having particular frequency characteristics, use 1/3-octave
band charts to describe vibration behavior. Narrowband spectra also
can be valuable, particularly for identifying discrete frequency
components and designing specific mitigation measures.

Note that it is preferred to characterize existing vibration in terms of
the rms velocity level instead of the peak PPV, which is commonly used
to monitor construction vibration. As discussed in Section 5.1, rms
velocity is considered more appropriate than PPV for describing human
response to building vibration.

**Step 2: Estimate Vibration Impact**

_Estimate ground-borne vibration and noise at sites where significant impact is probable_
_and assess for impact._

Predicting ground-borne vibration associated with a transportation project
continues to be a developing field. Because ground-borne vibration is a complex
phenomenon that is difficult to model and predict accurately, most projection
procedures that have been used for transit projects rely on empirical data.

The procedure described in this section is based on site-specific tests of
vibration propagation. This procedure was developed under a FTA-funded
research contract [(52) ] and is recommended for detailed evaluations of groundborne vibration. Other approaches to a prediction procedure, such as finite
element methods, can be used. See Appendix G for information on using non­
standard modeling procedures.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 152

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Overview of Prediction Procedure** - This procedure was developed to
allow the use of data collected in one location to accurately predict vibration
levels in another site where the geologic conditions may be completely different.
The procedure is based on transfer mobility. Transfer mobility is the complex
velocity response produced by a point force as a function of frequency. It
represents the relationship between a vibration source that excites the ground
and the resulting vibration of the ground surface. It is a function of both
frequency and distance from the source. The analyses in this manual focus on
transfer mobility magnitude, which is the magnitude for the velocity relative to
the force without reference to phase. The transfer mobility level is the level in
decibels relative to 1E-6 in/lb-s.

The transfer mobility measured at an existing transit system is used to
normalize ground-borne vibration data and remove the effects of geology. The
normalized vibration is referred to as the force density. Force density is the
force per root distance along the track in lb/ft [1/2] . The force density can be
combined with transfer mobility measurements at vibration-sensitive sites along
a new project to develop projections of future ground-borne vibration.

The transfer mobility between two points completely defines the composite
vibration propagation characteristics between the two points. In most practical
cases, receivers are close enough to the train tracks that the vibration cannot
be considered as originating from a single point. Therefore, the vibration source
must be modeled as a line-source. Consequently, the point transfer mobility
must be modified to account for a line-source. The subsequent line-source
transfer mobility is given in units of decibels relative to 1e-6 in/s/lb/sqrt(ft).

The prediction procedure considers ground-borne vibration to be divided into
several basic components described below and shown in Figure 6-5.

 - **Excitation Force (Force Density)** - The vibration energy is created
by oscillatory and impulsive forces. Steel wheels rolling on smooth steel
rails create random oscillatory forces. When a wheel encounters a
discontinuity such as a rail joint, an impulsive force is created. The force
excites the transit structure, such as the subway tunnel or the ballast
for at-grade track.

In the prediction method, the combination of the actual force generated
at the wheel/rail interface and the vibration of the transit structure are
usually combined into an equivalent force density level. The force
density level is the level in decibels of the force density relative to 1
lb/ft [1/2 ] and describes the force that excites the soil/rock surrounding the
transit structure.

 - **Vibration Propagation (Transfer Mobility)** - The vibration of the
transit structure causes vibration waves in the soil that propagate away
from the transit structure. The vibration energy can propagate through
the soil or rock in a variety of wave forms. All ground vibration includes
shear and compression waves. Rayleigh waves [(49) ] are also created and
propagate along the ground surface. These Rayleigh waves can be a

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 153

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

major carrier of vibration energy. The mathematical modeling of
vibration is complicated when there are soil strata with different elastic
properties, which is common. As indicated in Figure 6-5, the
propagation through the soil/rock is modeled using the transfer
mobility, which is usually determined experimentally.

The combination of the force density level and the transfer mobility is
used to predict the ground- surface vibration. This is the major
difference from the General Vibration Assessment, which generalizes
estimates of the ground-borne vibration.

 - **Building Vibration** - When the ground vibration excites a building
foundation, it sets the building into vibratory motion and vibration
waves propagate throughout the building structure. The interaction
between the ground and the foundation causes some reduction in
vibration levels. The amount of reduction is dependent on the mass and
stiffness of the foundation. The more massive the foundation, the lower
the response to ground vibration. As the vibration waves propagate
through the building, they can create vibration that can be felt and cause
windows and household items to rattle.

 - **Audible Noise** - Inaddition to vibration that can be felt, the vibration
of room surfaces radiates low-frequency sound that may be audible. The
sound level is affected by the amount of acoustical absorption in the
receiver room.

**Figure 6-5 Ground-Borne Vibration and Noise Model**

A fundamental assumption of the prediction approach outlined in this section is
that the force density, transfer mobility, and the building coupling to the ground
are all independent factors. The following equations are the basis for the

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 154

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

prediction procedure, where all of the quantities are one-third octave band
spectral levels in decibels with consistent reference values:

for L v is 1 micro in/sec [(37)(50) ]

഼ ෉ൎ෹෶ = A-weighting adjustment at the 1/3-octave band center frequency

All of the quantities given above are functions of frequency, and the standard
approach is to develop projections on a 1/3-octave band basis using the average
values for each 1/3-octave band. The end results of the analysis are the 1/3­
octave band spectra of the ground-borne vibration and the ground-borne noise.

The spectra are then compared to the vibration criteria for the Detailed
Vibration Analysis. The A-weighted ground-borne noise level can be calculated
from the vibration spectrum and compared to the criteria. This more detailed
approach differs from the General Vibration Assessment, where the overall
vibration velocity level and A-weighted sound level are predicted without any
consideration of the particular frequency characteristics of the propagation path.

The key steps in obtaining quantities for Eq. 6-5 and Eq. 6-6 are presented in the
following steps and include:

**Step 2a.** Estimate force density
**Step 2b.** Measure the point-source transfer mobility
**Step 2c.** Estimate line-source transfer mobility
**Step 2d.** Project ground-borne vibration and ground-borne noise

**2a. Estimate Force Density** - The estimate of force density can be based on
previous measurements or a special test program can be designed to measure
the force density at an existing facility.

If no suitable measurements are available, conduct testing at a transit facility
with equipment similar to the planned vehicles. Adjustments for factors such as
train speed, track support system, and vehicle suspension may be needed to
match the force density to the conditions at a specific site. Review the report

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 155

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

"State-of- the-Art Review: Prediction and Control of Ground-Borne Noise and
Vibration from Rail Transit Trains" [(41) ] for examples of appropriate adjustments.

Force density is not a quantity that can be measured directly; it must be inferred
from measurements of transfer mobility and train vibration at the same site. To
derive force density, the best results are achieved by deriving line-source
transfer mobility from a line of impacts. The standard approach is to average the
force density from measurements at three or more positions at one site. If
feasible, it is recommended to take measurements at more than one site and at
multiple speeds.

If no suitable measurements are available, see Steps 2b and 2c for guidelines on
obtaining line-source transfer mobility.

The force density for each 1/3-octave band is as follows:

ഷവഽ ൛ ഽ ෸ ൕഽൄ൅ാ
where:
ഷവഽ = force density level in dB
ഽ ෸ = measured train ground-borne vibration
level in VdB

ഽൄ൅ാ = line-source transfer mobility level in dB

**Eq. 6-7**

Figure 6-6 shows example trackbed force densities in decibels relative to 1
lb/(ft) [1/2] . These force densities were developed from measurements of vibration
from heavy and LRT vehicles and represent an incoherent line of vibration force
equal to the length of transit trains. This figure provides a comparison of the
vibration forces from heavy commuter trains and LRT vehicles with different
types of primary suspensions, illustrating the range of vibration forces commonly
experienced in a transit system. A force density of a vehicle includes the
characteristics of its track support system at the measurement site. Adjustments
must be applied to the force density to account for differences between the
facility where the force density was measured and the new system being
analyzed.

Figure 6-7 shows typical force densities for rail transit vehicles at 40 mph on
ballast and tie tracks, which are approximately within the tolerances shown in
Figure 6-6. The force densities should be applied very carefully for other track
types and speeds. The embedded tracks, although considerably stiffer than
ballast and tie tracks, are expected to show similar force density levels. [(53) ] The
curves in Figure 6-7 should also be applied with caution for newer generations
of light rail vehicles as well as vehicles that utilize direct fixation tracks. The
preferred approach for vibration predictions would be to perform force density
measurements at a system with vehicles and operations that are similar to those
of the future project.

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Figure 6-6 Typical Force Densities for Rail Transit Vehicles, 40 mph**

**Figure 6-7 Typical Force Densities for LRT Vehicles, 40 mph**

**2b. Measure Point-Source Transfer Mobility** - Using the appropriate
instrumentation, measure point-source transfer mobility for sources with short
lengths, such as buses or single car vehicles or columns supporting elevated
structures. For longer vehicles, see Section 2c for a discussion of measuring linesource transfer mobilities.

The test procedure to measure point-source transfer mobility consists of
impacting the ground by dropping a heavy weight and measuring the force into
the ground and the response at several distances from the impact. Other
excitation sources may include swept sine, sine-dwell, random vibration, and
maximum length sequence. The goal of the test is to create vibration pulses that

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 157

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

travel from the source to the receiver using the same path that will be taken by
the transit system vibration.

Figure 6-8 illustrates the field procedure for measuring both at-grade and
subway testing of transfer mobility. A weight is dropped from a height of 3 to 4
ft onto a force transducer. The responses of the force and vibration transducers
are recorded on a multichannel recorder for later analysis in the laboratory. An
alternative approach is to set up the analysis equipment in the field and capture
the signals directly. This complicates the field testing, but eliminates the
laboratory analysis of recorded data.

**Figure 6-8 Test Configuration for Measuring Transfer Mobility**

When the procedure is applied to subways, the force must be located at the
approximate depth of the subway. This is done by drilling a bore hole and
locating the force transducer at the bottom of the hole. The tests are usually
performed while the bore holes are drilled to allow for the use of the soilsampling equipment on the drill rig for the transfer mobility testing. The force
transducer is attached to the bottom of the drill string and lowered to the
bottom of the hole. A standard soil sampling hammer is used to excite the
ground; typically, a 140-pound weight is dropped 18 inches onto a collar that is
attached to the drill string. The force transducer must be capable of operating
under water if the water table is near the surface or a slurry drilling process is
used.

Standard signal-processing techniques are used to determine the transfer
function (frequency response function) between the exciting force and the
resultant ground-borne vibration. Numerical regression methods are used to
combine a number of two-point transfer functions into a smooth point-source
transfer mobility level that represents the average vibration propagation
characteristics of a site as a function of both distance from the source and

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 158

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

frequency. The transfer mobility level is usually expressed in terms of a group of
1/3-octave band transfer mobility levels. Figure 6-9 is an example of pointsource transfer mobility levels from a series of tests at the Transportation
Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado. [(50)(54)(55)(56)(57) ]

**Figure 6-9 Example of Point-Source Transfer Mobility** −

**Instrumentation**
Performing a transfer mobility test requires specialized equipment, which is
generally available from commercial sources. Typical instrumentation for fieldtesting and laboratory analysis of transfer mobility is shown in Figure 6-10.

A load cell can be used as the force transducer. The force transducer should be
capable of impact loads of 5,000 to 50,000 pounds depending on the hammer
used for the impact. For borehole testing, the load cell must be hermetically
sealed and capable of being used at the bottom of a 30- to 100-foot-deep hole
partially filled with water.

Either accelerometers or geophones can be used as the vibration transducers.
Geophones should be carefully mounted so that they are vertical. The
requirement is that the transducers with the associated amplifiers be capable of
accurately measuring levels of 0.0001 in/sec at 40 Hz and have a flat frequency
response from 6 Hz to 400 Hz. Data should be acquired with a digital
acquisition system with a flat frequency response over the range of 6 to 400 Hz.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 159

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Figure 6-10 Equipment Required for Field Testing and Laboratory Analysis**

A narrowband spectrum analyzer or signal-processing software can be used to
calculate the transfer function and coherence between the force and vibration
data. The analyzer must be capable of capturing impulses from at least two
channels to calculate the frequency spectrum of the transfer function between
the force and vibration channels. All transfer functions should include the
average of at least 20 impulses. Time averaging of the impulses will provide
substantial signal enhancement, which is usually required to accurately
characterize the transfer function. Signal enhancement is particularly important
when the vibration transducer is more than 100 ft from the impact.

Alternative methods of determining transfer mobility may be used, provided
that these techniques have been demonstrated to provide the same results as
the conventional weight-drop method over the frequency range of 6 Hz to 400
Hz. See Appendix G for information on developing and using non-standard
procedures. These methods may include using other impulse-response
measurement systems involving the use of shakers or electro-mechanical
actuators, stimuli such as sweeps or maximum length sequences (MLS), and
various signal processing techniques. A forthcoming ANSI Standard will describe
in detail the procedures, methodologies, and reporting requirements for
performing ground-borne vibration propagation measurements.

The transfer function can be calculated with either a spectrum analyzer or
signal-processing software. Note that transfer functions should include the
average of at least 20 impulses. Specialized multi-channel spectrum analyzers
have built-in capabilities for computing transfer functions and are
computationally efficient. However, signal-processing software can offer more

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 160

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

flexibility in analyzing data signals and allows the use of different digital signal
processing methods. Typical measurement programs involve acquisition of data
in the field and later processing of the information in a laboratory. However,
recent advances in instrumentation and signal-processing software allow data to
be collected and analyzed while in the field.

**2c. Estimate Line-Source Transfer Mobility** - Estimate line-source
transfer mobility for long sources such as multi-car trains. Line-source transfer
mobilities are used to normalize measured vibration velocity levels from train
passbys and to obtain force density. Two different approaches can be used to
develop estimates of line-source transfer mobility. The first consists of using
lines of transducers and the second consists of a line of impact positions.

**Option A: Lines of Transducers** - Develop line-source transfer mobility
curves from tests using one or more lines of transducers as shown in Figure
6-11 and described below.

**Figure 6-11 Analysis of Transfer Mobility**

**Ai.** Obtain the narrowband transfer function between source and receiver at
each measurement position. There should be a minimum of four distances in any
test line. Because of the possibility of local variations in propagation
characteristics, two or more lines should be used to characterize a site if
possible. A total of 10 to 20 transducer positions are often used to characterize
a site.

**Aii.** Calculate the equivalent 1/3-octave band transfer functions, generally
between 6 and 400 Hz. This reduces each spectrum to 15 numbers. As shown
in Figure 6-11, the 1/3-octave band spectrum is much smoother than the
narrowband spectrum.

**Aiii.** Calculate a best-fit curve of transfer mobility as a function of distance for
each 1/3-octave band. When analyzing a specific site, the best-fit curve will be

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 161

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

based on 10 to 20 points. Up to several hundred points could be used to
determine average best-fit curves for a number of sites.

**Aiv.** Apply the best-fit curve to the vibration sources. The 1/3-octave band
best-fit curves can be directly applied to point vibration sources. Buses can
usually be considered point-sources, as can columns supporting elevated
structures. However, for a line vibration source such as a train, numerical
integration must be used to calculate the equivalent line-source transfer
mobility. The numerical integration procedures are detailed in the TRB
publication: “A Prediction Procedure for Rail Transportation Ground-Borne
Noise and Vibration.” [(50) ]

**Option B: Line of Impulses** - This second procedure for estimating linesource transfer mobility is best for detailed assessment of specific vibration
paths or specific buildings and is a more direct approach.

**Bi.** Measure multiple point-source transfer mobilities according to the
procedures in Step 2b above. The vibration transducers are placed at specific
points of interest and a line of impacts is used. For example, a 150-foot train
might be represented by a line of 11 impact positions along the track centerline
at 15-foot intervals (Figure 6-12).

**Bii.** Sum the point-source results using Simpson's rule [xiii ] for numerical
integration to calculate the line-source transfer mobility.

Figure 6-13 shows an example of line-source transfer mobilities that were
derived from the point-source transfer mobilities shown in Figure 6-9.

**Figure 6-12 Schematic of Transfer Mobility Measurements Using a Line of Impacts**

xiii Simpson’s rule is a method for approximating integrals.

**2d. Project Ground-Borne Vibration and Noise** - Combine force density
and line-source transfer mobility to project ground-borne vibration. Then, apply
adjustment factors to estimate the building response to the ground-borne
vibration and to estimate the A-weighted sound level inside buildings.

The propagation of vibration from the building foundation to the receiver room
is very complex and dependent on the specific design of the building. Detailed
evaluation of the vibration propagation would require extensive use of
numerical procedures such as the finite element method. Such a detailed
evaluation is generally not practical for individual buildings considered in this
manual. If the detailed features of the individual buildings are available, the
recommended procedure is to estimate the propagation of vibration through a
building and the radiation of sound by vibrating building surfaces using simple
empirical or theoretical models. The recommended procedures are outlined in
[the Handbook of Urban Rail Noise and Vibration Control.](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/30348) [(44) ] The approach
consists of adding the following adjustments to the 1/3-octave band spectrum of
the projected ground-borne vibration:

 - **Building response or coupling loss** - This adjustment represents
the change in the incident ground-borne vibration due to the presence
of the building foundation. The adjustments described in the handbook
(44) are shown in Figure 6-14. Note that the correction is zero when
estimating basement floor vibration or vibration of at-grade slabs.
Measured values may be used in place of these generic adjustments.

 - **Transmission through the building** - The vibration amplitude
typically decreases as the vibration energy propagates from the
foundation through the remainder of the building. The general
assumption is that vibration attenuates by 1 to 2 dB for each floor.

 - **Floor resonances** - Vibration amplitudes will be amplified because of
resonances of the floor/ceiling systems. For a typical wood-frame

residential structure, the fundamental resonance is usually in the 15 to
20 Hz range. Reinforced-concrete slab floors in modern buildings will
have fundamental resonance frequencies in the 20 to 30 Hz range. An
amplification resulting in a gain of approximately 6 dB should be used in
the frequency range of the fundamental resonance.

 - **Floor vibration and ground-borne noise** - The projected floor
vibration is used to estimate the levels of ground-borne noise. The
primary factors affecting noise level are the average vibration level of
the room surfaces and the amount of acoustical absorption within the
room. The radiation adjustment is -5 dB for typical rooms, [(] **[37]** [) (50) ] which

**Figure 6-14 Foundation Response for Various Types of Buildings**

Where detailed information on the structural features of individual buildings are
unavailable and there are no site-specific data on outdoor to indoor propagation
characteristics, the preferred approach is to apply a combined factor for the
foundation response and the gain from floor resonances. Empirical data based
on the TCRP D-12 Project from 34 measurement sites across 5 cities in North

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 164

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

America and other studies suggest that the average change in vibration from
outdoor to indoor was 0 dB across all 1/3-octave bands with a standard
deviation of approximately 5 to 6 dB in the 31.5 to 63 Hz frequency. [(43)(48) ]
Therefore, the recommended approach for predicting indoor vibration based on
outdoor data is to use an adjustment of +3 to +6 dB for light-weight, woodframe construction and use an adjustment of 0 dB for heavier buildings.

However, for buildings with high-vibration sensitivity or where there is concern
regarding interference with vibration-sensitive equipment, it is advisable to
measure the outdoor-indoor response of the building, using the process
described in Section 2b or 2c, to determine the actual response of the
foundation and building to vibration.

**Step 3: Assess Vibration Impact**

_Take inventory of vibration-sensitive land uses with impact_ .

Assess vibration impact at each receiver of interest using the impact criteria in
Section 6.3. Note that ground-borne vibration and noise levels that exceeded
criteria in the General Vibration Assessment may not cause impact according to
the more detailed procedures of the Detailed Vibration Analysis; in which case,
mitigation is not required. But if projected levels still exceed the criteria,
evaluate vibration mitigation measures using the spectra provided by the
Detailed Vibration Analysis.

**Step 4: Determine Vibration Mitigation Measures**

_Select practical vibration control measures that will be effective at the dominant_
_vibration frequencies and compatible with the given transit structure and track support_
_system._

The purpose of vibration mitigation is to minimize the adverse effects that the
project ground-borne vibration and ground-borne noise will have on sensitive
land uses. Because ground-borne vibration is not as common a problem as
environmental noise, the mitigation approaches have not been as well defined. In
some cases it may be necessary to develop innovative approaches to control the
impact. See Appendix G for information on using non-standard methods.

Standard vibration control measures for rail transit systems are discussed in this
step. Note that vibration control measures for rail transit systems are not
always effective for freight trains. [(xiv) ] Bus systems rarely cause vibration impact,
but if impact occurs, roadway roughness or unevenness caused by bumps, pot
holes, expansion joints, or driveway transitions are usually the causes.
Smoothing the roadway surface is typically the recommended course of
action. [(xv) ]

xiv The heavy axle loads associated with freight rail are outside the range of applicable design parameters for vibration reduction
on lighter rail transit systems. Plans to relocate existing railroad tracks closer to vibration-sensitive sites in order to
accommodate a new rail transit line in the ROW must be carefully considered because it may not be possible to mitigate the
increased vibration impact from freight trains.
xv In cases where a rubber-tired system runs inside a building, such as an airport people mover, vibration control may involve
additional measures. Loading and unloading of guideway support beams may generate dynamic forces that transmit into the
building structure. Special guideway support systems may be required, similar to the discussion below regarding floating slabs.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 165

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

Vibration reduction measures incur additional costs to a system. Some of the
same treatments for noise mitigation can be considered for vibration mitigation.
Costs for noise control measures are documented in a report from the Transit
Cooperative Research Program (TCRP). [(31) ] Where applicable to vibration
reduction, costs for noise abatement methods from that report are given in the
following sections. These costs reflect the noise mitigation costs as of 1997
(unless otherwise noted), and should only be used as representative estimates
when considering noise mitigation options. Current noise mitigation costs
should be researched before decisions on noise mitigation options are finalized,
and then they should be documented according to Section 8.

Mitigation of vibration impacts may involve treatments at the source, along the
source-to-receiver propagation path, or at the receiver.

**1a. Evaluate Source Treatments** - The most effective vibration mitigation
treatments are applied at the vibration source. This is the preferred approach to
mitigation when possible. Possible source treatments include:

 - **Preventative Maintenance** - Effective maintenance programs are
essential for controlling ground-borne vibration. Key vibration points
are discussed below; see Section 4.5, Step 7 for more detailed
information on the benefits of effective maintenance programs on
controlling transit noise and vibration. While these are not mitigation
measures in the traditional sense, and should not be included as
mitigation in an environmental document, they can help to keep both
noise and vibration levels at a “like-new” level or reduce both in
systems with deferred maintenance.

 **Rail grinding** is a particularly important practice for vibration
mitigation for rail that develops corrugations. The TCRP report
notes that periodic rail grinding results in a net savings per year on
wheel and rail wear. Most transit systems contract out rail grinding,
although some of the larger systems make the investment and do
their own grinding. As mentioned in Section 4.5, Step 7, the typical
rail grinding cost would be $1000 to $7000 per grinding pass mile,
with an additional investment of approximately $1 million for the
equipment for a larger transit system to do its own grinding.

 **Dramatic vibration reduction** results can be achieved by
removing wheel flats through **wheel truing** . As mentioned in
Section 4.5, Step 7, a wheel truing machine costs approximately $1
million, including associated maintenance, materials, and labor costs.
The TCRP report figures a system with 700 vehicles would incur a
yearly cost of $300,000 to $400,000 for a wheel truing program.

 **Profile grinding of the rail head** in combination with a wheel
truing program may be the most practical approach to controlling
and reducing vibration and noise where such practices are not
normally conducted. Profiles should be defined during the design
phase and should be in place when system opens. [(32) ] The cost of

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 166

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

wheel and rail profile matching may be incorporated in the new
vehicle and new rail costs.

Rough wheels or rails can increase vibration levels by as much as 20
dB in extreme cases, negating the effects of even the most effective
vibration control measures. Yet, it is rare that vibration control
measures (such as those discussed below) will provide more than
15 to 20 dB attenuation. When there are ground-borne vibration
impacts with existing transit equipment, the best vibration control
measure often is to implement new or improved maintenance
procedures. Grinding rough or corrugated rail and wheel truing to
eliminate wheel flats and restore the wheel contour may provide
considerable vibration reduction. Regular maintenance may replace
the need to modify the existing track system, such as through
adding floating slabs.

- **Planning and Design of Special Trackwork** - Alarge percentage of
the vibration impact from a new transit facility is often caused by wheel
impacts at special trackwork for turnouts and crossovers. When
feasible, the most effective vibration control measure is to relocate the
special trackwork to a less vibration-sensitive area. This may require
adjusting the location by several hundred feet provided it will not have
an adverse impact on the operation plan for the system. Careful review
of crossover and turnout locations during the project development
phase is an important step to minimizing potential for vibration impact.

Another approach is to use special devices (frogs) at turnouts and
crossovers that incorporate mechanisms to close the gaps between
running rails. Frogs with spring-loaded mechanisms and frogs with
movable points can substantially reduce vibration levels near crossovers.
According to the TCRP report, a spring frog costs about $12,000, twice
the cost of a standard frog. A movable point frog involves elaborate
signal and control circuitry resulting in higher costs at approximately
$200,000.

- **Vehicle Specifications** - The ideal rail vehicle with respect to
minimizing ground-borne vibration should have the following
characteristics:

 Low, unsprung weight
 Soft primary suspension
 A minimum of metal-to-metal contact between moving parts of
the truck
 Smooth wheels that are perfectly round

A limit for the vertical resonance frequency of the primary suspension
should be included in the specifications for any new vehicle. A vertical
resonance frequency of 12 Hz or less is sufficient to control the levels
of ground-borne vibration, although some have recommended the
vertical resonance frequency be less than 8 Hz.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 167

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

- **Special Track Support Systems** - When the vibration assessment
indicates that vibration levels will be excessive, the track support system
is typically modified to reduce the vibration levels.

Floating slabs, resiliently supported ties, high-resilience fasteners, and
ballast mats can be used to reduce the levels of ground-borne vibration.
To be effective, all of these measures must be optimized for the
frequency spectrum of the vibration. Most of these relatively standard
procedures have been successfully used on several subway projects.

Applications on at-grade and elevated track are less common. This is
because vibration impact is less common for at-grade and elevated
track. Note that the cost of these types of vibration control measures is
a higher percentage of the overall construction costs for at-grade and
elevated track, and exposure to the elements can require substantial
design modifications.

Each major vibration control measure for track support is discussed
below. Costs for these treatments are not covered by the TCRP report,
but are given as estimates based on transit agency experience.

 **Resilient fasteners** - Resilient fasteners are used to fasten the
rail to concrete track slabs. Standard resilient fasteners are very
stiff in the vertical direction, usually in the range of 200,000
lb/in, and do provide some vibration reduction compared to the
rigid fastening systems used on older systems (e.g., wood halfties embedded in concrete).

Special fasteners with vertical stiffness in the range of 30,000
lb/in may reduce vibration by as much as 5 to 10 dB at
frequencies above 30 to 40 Hz. These premium fasteners vary
in cost and can be priced competitively when purchased in large
quantities.

 **Ballast mats** - Aballast mat consists of a rubber or other type
of elastomer pad that is placed under the ballast. In general, the
mat must be placed on a concrete pad to be effective. They will
not be as effective if placed directly on the soil or the subballast. Consequently, most ballast mat applications are in
subway or elevated structures.

Ballast mats can provide 8 to 12 dB attenuation at frequencies
above 25 to 30 Hz. [(58) ] Ballast mats are often a good retrofit
measure for existing tie-and-ballast track where there is
vibration impact. Installed ballast mats cost approximately $180
per track-foot.

 **Undertie pads** - Undertie pads (resiliently supported
concrete ties) consist of a rubber pad mounted on the bottom
of a concrete tie directly on the ballast. The pads provide
vibration isolation at frequencies above 25 Hz and are easy to

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 168

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

install or retrofit. Installed undertie pads cost approximately
$260 per track-foot.

 **Resiliently supported ties** - The resiliently supported tie
system consists of concrete ties supported by rubber pads
resting on top of a slab track or subway invert. The rails are
fastened directly to the concrete ties using standard rail clips.
Resiliently supported ties provide vibration reduction in
between 15 to 40 Hz, which is particularly appropriate for
transit systems with vibration impact in the 20 to 30 Hz range.
A resiliently supported tie system costs approximately $400 per
track-foot.

 **Floating slabs** - Floating slabs can be very effective at
controlling ground-borne vibration and noise and consist of a
concrete slab supported on resilient elements such as rubber or
a similar elastomer. Floating slabs are effective at frequencies
greater than their single-degree-of-freedom vertical resonance
frequency.

Floating slabs are among the most expensive vibration control
treatments. A typical double-tie floating slab system costs
approximately 4 times the cost of ballast and tie per track foot.
Examples of floating slabs include:

```
 ­
```
Floating slabs used in Washington, DC; Atlanta, GA; and
Boston, MA, were all designed to have a vertical
resonance in the 14 to 17 Hz range.

```
 ­
```
A special system referred to as the double-tie system
was first used in Toronto. It consists of 5-foot-long
slabs with four or more rubber pads under each slab.
This system was designed with a resonance frequency in
the 12 to 16 Hz rang3.

```
 ­
```
Another special floating slab was used in San Francisco’s
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. It uses a
discontinuous precast concrete double-tie system with
a resonance frequency in the 5 to 10 Hz frequency

range.

 **Tire-derived aggregate (TDA)** - TDA (shredded tires) consists
of a layer of tire shreds wrapped in geotech fabric placed
underneath the ballast on hard packed ground. This is a new, lowcost option that can provide reduction in vibration levels at
frequencies above 25 Hz. This mitigation measure has proven to be
effective for the Denver Regional Transportation District (RTD)
light rail system as well as the Santa Clara Valley Transportation
Authority (VTA) light rail system, [(59) ] but the effective life of TDA
has not been determined. Installed TDA costs approximately $260
per track-foot.

 **Other treatments** - Changing any feature of the track support
system can change the levels of ground-borne vibration. Approaches

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 169

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

such as using heavier rail, thicker ballast, or heavier ties can be
expected to reduce the vibration levels. There also is some
indication that vibration levels are lower with wood ties compared
to concrete ties. But there is little confirmation that any of these
approaches will make a substantial change in the vibration levels.

 - **Operational Changes** - The most effective operational change is to
reduce the vehicle speed. Reducing the train speed by a factor of two
will reduce vibration levels approximately 6 dB. Other operational
changes include:
 Use of equipment that generates the lowest vibration levels during
the nighttime hours when people are most sensitive to vibration and
noise.

 Adjusting nighttime schedules to minimize movements in the most
sensitive hours.

While there are tangible mitigation benefits from speed reductions and
limits on operations during the most sensitive time periods, FTA does not
generally accept speed reduction as a vibration mitigation measure for two
important reasons: (1) speed reduction is unenforceable and negated if
vehicle operators do not adhere to established policies, and (2) it is
contrary to the purpose of the transit investment by FTA, which is to move
as many people as possible as efficiently and safely as possible. FTA does not
recommend limits on operations as a way to reduce vibration impacts.

**1b. Evaluate Path Treatments** - When vibration mitigation treatments
cannot be applied at the vibration source or additional mitigation is required
after treating the source, the next preferred placement of vibration mitigation is
along the vibration propagation path between the source and receiver. Possible
path treatments include:

 - **Trenches** - Use of trenches to control ground-borne vibration is
analogous to controlling airborne noise with noise barriers. This
approach has not received much attention in the United States, but
trenches could be a practical method for controlling transit vibration
from at-grade track. A rule-of-thumb given by Richert and Hall [(60) ] is that
if the trench is located close to the source, the trench bottom must be
at least 0.6 times the Rayleigh wavelength below the vibration source.
For most soils, Rayleigh waves travel at around 600 ft/sec, which means
that the wavelength at 30 Hz is 20 ft, requiring that a trench be
approximately 15 ft deep to be effective at 30 Hz.

A trench can be effective as a vibration barrier if it is either open or
solid. The Toronto Transit Commission tested a trench filled with

Styrofoam to keep it open and reported successful performance over a
period of at least one year. Solid barriers can be constructed with sheet
piling or concrete poured into a trench.

 - **Buffer Zones** - Expanding the rail ROW can be the most economical
method of reducing the vibration impact by simply increasing the
distance between the source and receiver. A similar approach is to

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 170

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

negotiate a vibration easement from the affected property owners (e.g.,
a row of single-family homes adjacent to a proposed commuter rail
line). There may be legal limitations, however, on the ability of funding
agencies to acquire land strictly for the purpose of mitigating vibration
(or noise) impact.
**1c. Evaluate Receiver Treatments** - When vibration mitigation treatments
cannot be applied at the source or along the propagation path, or if
combinations of treatments are required, treatments to the receivers can be
considered as described below.

 - **Building Modifications** - In some circumstances, it is practical to
modify the affected building to reduce the vibration level. Vibration
isolation of buildings consists of supporting the building foundation on
elastomer pads, similar to bridge bearing pads. Vibration isolation of
buildings is seldom an option for existing buildings and is typically only
possible for new construction. Vibration impacts on sensitive laboratory
instruments, such as electron microscopes, may be controlled with
vibration isolation tables.

This approach is particularly important for shared-use facilities such as
an office space above a transit station or terminal. When vibrationsensitive equipment such as electron microscopes will be affected by
transit vibration, specific modifications to the building structure may be
the most cost-effective method of controlling the impact aside from
modification of equipment mounting systems. For example, the floor
upon which the vibration-sensitive equipment is located could be
stiffened and isolated from the remainder of the building to reduce the
vibration. Alternatively, the equipment mounting systems could be
modified or the equipment could be relocated to a different building at
far less cost.

Noise and Vibration during
Construction

Construction noise and vibration often generates complaints from the
community, even when construction is for a limited timeframe. Public concerns
about construction noise and vibration increase considerably with lengthy
periods of heavy construction on major projects as well as prevalence of
nighttime construction (often scheduled to avoid disrupting workday road and
rail traffic). Noise and vibration complaints typically arise from interference with
people's activities, especially when the adjacent community has no clear
understanding of the extent or duration of the construction. Misunderstandings
can arise when the community thinks a contractor is being insensitive, and the
contractor believes it is performing the work in compliance with local
ordinances. This situation underscores the need for early identification and
assessment of potential problem areas.

This section outlines the procedures for assessing noise and vibration impacts
during construction. The type of assessment (qualitative or quantitative) and the
level of analysis are determined based on the scale of the project and
surrounding land uses. In cases where a full quantitative assessment is not
warranted, a qualitative assessment of the construction noise and vibration
environment can lead to greater understanding and tolerance in the community.
For major projects with extended periods of construction at specific locations, a
quantitative assessment can aid contractors in making bids by allowing changes
in construction approach and including mitigation costs before the construction
plans are finalized.

Generally, local noise ordinances are not very useful for evaluating construction
noise impact. They usually relate to nuisance and hours of allowed activity, and
sometimes specify limits in terms of maximum levels, but are generally not
practical for assessing the impact of a construction project. Project construction
noise criteria should take into account the existing noise environment, the
absolute noise levels during construction activities, the duration of the
construction, and the adjacent land uses. While it is not the purpose of this
manual to specify standardized criteria for construction noise impact, the
following guidelines can be considered reasonable criteria for assessment. If
these criteria are exceeded, there may be adverse community reaction.

Procedures for assessing construction noise are presented in Section 7.1.
Procedures for assessing construction vibration are presented in Section 7.2.

7.1 Construction Noise Assessment

Noise impacts from construction may vary greatly depending on the duration
and complexity of the project. The key elements of the Construction Noise
Assessment procedure and recommended workflow are as follows.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 172

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Step 1:** Determine Level of Construction Noise Assessment

**Step 2:** Use a Qualitative Construction Noise Assessment to Estimate
Construction Noise

**Step 3:** Use a Quantitative Construction Noise Assessment to Estimate
Construction Noise

**Step 4:** Assess Construction Noise Impact

**Step 5:** Determine Construction Noise Mitigation Measures

If there is uncertainty in how to determine the appropriate level of assessment,
contact the FTA Regional office.

**Step 1: Determine Level of Construction Noise**

**Assessment**

_Determine the appropriate level of assessment based on the scale and type of the_
_project and depending on the stage of environmental review._

Consider the following factors:

 - Scale of the project

 - Proximity of noise-sensitive sites to the construction zones

 - Number of noise-sensitive receivers in the project area

 - Duration of construction activities near noise-sensitive receivers

 - Schedule, including the construction days, hours, and time periods

 - Method (e.g., cut-and-cover vs. bored tunneling)

 - Concern about construction noise expressed in comments by the
general public (e.g., through scoping or public meetings)

**1a. Determine if an assessment is required** - Construction Noise
Assessments are not required for many small projects including:

 - Installation of safety features like grade-crossing signals;

 - Track improvements within the ROW; or

 - Erecting small buildings and facilities which are similar in scale to the
surrounding development.

For small projects like these, include descriptions in the environmental
document of the length of construction, the loudest equipment to be used, the
expected truck access routes, the avoidance of nighttime activity, and any other
relevant planned construction method.

**1b. Determine whether a qualitative or quantitative assessmentis**
**required**

 - **Qualitative Construction Noise Assessment** - Qualitative
Construction Noise Assessments may be required for projects with less
than a month of construction time in a noise-sensitive area. See Step 2
for more information on Qualitative Construction Noise Assessments.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 173

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

 - **Quantitative Construction Noise Assessments** - Quantitative
Construction Noise Assessments may be required for projects with a
month or more of construction in noise-sensitive areas or if particularly
noisy equipment will be involved. See Step 3 for more information on
Quantitative Construction Noise Assessments.

**Step 2: Use a Qualitative Construction Noise Assessment**

**to Estimate Construction Noise**

_Use a qualitative construction noise assessment to estimate construction noise for_
_appropriate projects per Section 7.1, Step 1b._

Provide qualitative descriptions in the environmental document of the following
elements:

 - Duration of construction (both overall and at specific locations)

 - Equipment expected to be used (e.g., noisiest equipment)

 - Schedule with limits on times of operation (e.g., daytime use only)

 - Monitoring of noise

 - Forum for communicating with the public

 - Commitments to limit noise levels to certain levels, including any local
ordinances that apply

 - Consideration of application of noise control treatments used
successfully in other projects

Effective community outreach and relations are important for these projects.
Disseminate information to the public early regarding the kinds of construction
equipment, expected noise levels, and durations to forewarn potentially affected
neighbors about the temporary inconvenience. Including a general description of
the variation of noise levels during a typical construction day may also be
helpful.

Note that the construction criteria in Step 4 do not apply to qualitative

assessments.

**Step 3: Use a Quantitative Construction Noise Assessment**

**to Estimate Construction Noise**

_Use a quantitative construction noise assessment to estimate construction noise for_
_appropriate projects per Section 7.1, Step 1b._

For Quantitative Construction Noise Assessments, follow the recommended
procedure in this step and include a description of the planned construction
methods and any basic measures that have been identified to reduce the
potential impact, such as prohibiting the noisiest construction activities during
the nighttime, in the environmental document. It may be prudent, however, to
defer final decisions on noise control measures until the project and
construction plans are defined in greater detail during the engineering phase.

 - **Noise Source Levels from Typical Construction Equipment**
**and Operations** - The noise levels generated by construction

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 174

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

equipment vary greatly on factors such as the type of equipment, the
equipment model, the operation being performed, and the condition of
the equipment. Typically, the dominant source of noise from most
construction equipment is the engine, often a diesel engine, which
usually does not have sufficient muffling. In other cases, such as impact
pile-driving or pavement-breaking, noise generated by the process
dominates. Construction equipment can be considered to operate in
the following two modes for Construction Noise Assessments:
 **Stationary** - Stationary equipment operates in one location for
one or more days at a time, with either a fixed power operation
(pumps, generators, compressors) or a variable noise operation
(pile drivers, pavement breakers).
 **Mobile** - Mobile equipment moves around the construction site
with power applied in cyclic fashion (bulldozers, loaders), or to and
from the site (trucks). Movement around the site is considered in
the construction noise prediction procedure.

Variation in power imposes additional complexity in characterizing the noise
source level from mobile equipment. Describe the noise at a reference distance
from the equipment operating at full power and adjusting it based on the duty
cycle of the activity to determine the L eq(t) of the operation.

Typical noise levels from representative equipment are included in Table 7-1.
The levels are based on an EPA Report, [(61) ] measured data from railroad
construction equipment taken during the 1976 Northeast Corridor
Improvement Project, the FHWA Roadway Construction Noise Model, and
other measured data.

For equipment that is not represented in Table 7-1, measure the noise levels
according to the standard procedures for measuring the exterior noise levels
for the certification of mobile and stationary construction equipment by the
Society of Automotive Engineers. [(62)(63) ]

**3a.** Use the metric L eq(t) to assess construction noise. This unit is appropriate
because L eq(t) can be used to describe:

 - Noise level from operation of each piece of equipment separately, and
levels can be combined to represent the noise level from all equipment
operating during a given period

 - Noise level during an entire phase

 - Average noise over all phases of the construction

**3b.** Use Eq. 7-1 to predict construction noise impact for major transit projects,
considering the noise generated by the equipment and noise propagation due to
distance. Calculate ഽ ෧ෳෳ෧ෳ෷෫ෲ for all equipment individually, then use decibel
addition to sum the ഽ ෉෧ෳෳ෧ෳ෷෫ෲ for all equipment operating during the same time
period. See Appendix B.1.1 for information on decibel addition.

equipment is in use over the specified time period
വ = distance from the receiver to the piece of equipment, ft
സ = a constant that accounts for topography and ground effects

Determine the quantities for Eq. 7-1 based on the level of assessment as
described below.

 - A general assessment of construction noise is warranted for projects in
an early assessment stage when the equipment roster and schedule are
undefined and only a rough estimate of construction noise levels is
practical.

 - A detailed analysis of construction noise is warranted when many noisesensitive sites are adjacent to a construction project or where
contractors are faced with stringent local ordinances or heightened
public concerns expressed in early outreach efforts.

Complete the appropriate assessment for each phase of construction. Major
construction projects are accomplished in several different phases. Each phase
has a specific equipment mix, depending on the work to be accomplished during
that phase. As a result of the equipment mix, each phase has its own noise
characteristics; some phases have higher continuous noise levels than others,
and some have higher impact noise levels than others.

**Option A: General Assessment** - Determine the quantities for Eq. 7-1
based on the following assumptions for a General Assessment of each phase of
construction.

 - **Noise emission level (** ඇ කජඞඨඨඞඤඣ **)** - Determine the emission level at
50 ft according to noise from typical construction equipment described
above and Table 7-1.

 - **Usage factor (** ർ඙ඟ ඐඨඖගක **)** - Assume a usage factor of 1. This assumes a
time period of one-hour with full power operation. Most construction
equipment operates continuously for periods of one-hour or more
during the construction period.

Therefore, 10log(Adj usage ) = 0 and can be omitted from the equation.

 - **Distance (D)** - Assume that all equipment operates at the center of
the project, or centerline for guideway or highway construction project.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 177

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

 - **Ground effect (G)** - G=0 assuming free-field conditions and ignoring
ground effects. If ground effects are of specific importance to the
assessment, consider using the Detailed Analysis procedure.

Only determine the ഽ ෧ෳෳ෧ෳ෷෫ෲ for the two noisiest pieces of equipment
expected to be used in each phase of construction. Then, sum the levels for
each phase of construction using decibel addition.

**Option B: Detailed Analysis-** Determine the quantities for Eq. 7-1 based on
the following assumptions for a Detailed Analysis of each phase of construction.
Alternatively, for detailed, long-term, and complex construction projects or
projects near a particularly sensitive site, the FHWA’s Windows-based
screening tool, “Roadway Construction Noise Model (RCNM),” can be used for
the prediction of construction noise. [(64) ]

 - **Noise emission level (** ඇ කජඞඨඨඞඤඣ **)** - Measure or certify the noise
emission level for each piece of equipment.

 - **Usage factor (** ർ඙ඟ ඐඨඖගක **)** - Long-term construction project noise
impact is based on a 30-day average L dn, the times of day of construction
activity (nighttime noise is penalized by 10 dB in residential areas), and
the percentage of time the equipment is used during a period of time
that will affect ല൏ൕ ෝ෵෣෩෧ .

For example, an 8-hour L eq(t) is determined by making ല൏ൕ ෝ෵෣෩෧ the
percentage of time each individual piece of equipment operates under
full power in that period. Similarly, the 30-day average L dn is determined
from the ല൏ൕ ෝ෵෣෩෧ ⁡ expressed by the percentage of time the equipment
is used during the daytime hours (7 a.m. to 10 p.m.) and nighttime (10
p.m. to 7 a.m.), separately, over a 30-day period. To account for
increased sensitivity to nighttime noise, the nighttime noise levels are
adjusted by 10 dB in the L dn computation (see Appendix B.1.4.5).

 - **Distance (D)** - Determine the location of each piece of equipment
during operation and the distance to each receiver.

 - **Ground effect (G)** - Use Table 4-26 in Section 4.5, Step 3 to calculate
G to account for the site topography, natural and man-made barriers,
and ground effects.

Compute the 8-hour L eq(t) ( ഽ ෧ෳෳ෧ෳ෷෫ෲ(ോ෪෴) ) and the 30-day average L dn
( ഽ ෦෰ෳ෧ෳ෷෫ෲ(െൃ෦෣෻) ) for all equipment expected to be used in each phase
of construction separately. Then, sum the levels for each phase of
construction using Eq. 4-56 and Eq. 4-57 in Table 4-32.

**Step 4: Assess Construction Noise Impact**

_Compare the predicted noise levels from the Quantitative Construction Noise_
_Assessment with impact criteria to assess impact from construction noise for each_
_phase of construction._

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 178

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

No standardized criteria have been developed for assessing construction noise
impact. Consequently, criteria must be developed on a project-specific basis
unless local ordinances apply. As stated earlier in this section, local noise
ordinances are typically not very useful in evaluating construction noise. They
usually relate to nuisance and hours of allowed activity, and sometimes specify
limits in terms of maximum levels, but are generally not practical for assessing
the impact of a construction project. Project construction noise criteria should
account for the existing noise environment, the absolute noise levels during
construction activities, the duration of the construction, and the adjacent land
use. While it is not the purpose of this manual to specify standardized criteria
for construction noise impact, the following guidelines can be considered
reasonable criteria for assessment. If these criteria are exceeded, there may be
adverse community reaction.

The construction impact guidelines are presented based on the level of
quantitative assessment.

**Option A: General Assessment** - Compare the combined ഽ ෧ෳෳ෧ෳ෷෫ෲ(ൄ෪෴) ⁡ for
the two noisiest pieces of equipment for each phase of construction determined
in Section 7.1, Step 3 to the criteria below. Then, identify locations where the
level exceeds the criteria.

**Step 5: Determine Construction Noise Mitigation**

**Measures**

_Evaluate the need for mitigation and select appropriate mitigation measures._

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 179

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

Where potential impacts have been identified according to Section 7.1, Step 4,
evaluate appropriate control measures. Include descriptions of how each
affected location will be treated with one or more mitigation measures in the
environmental document.

**5a.** Determine the appropriate approach for construction noise control.
Categories of approaches include:

 - **Design considerations and project layout**
 Construct noise barriers, such as temporary walls or piles of
excavated material, between noisy activities and noise-sensitive
receivers.
 Re-route truck traffic away from residential streets. Select streets
with the fewest homes if no alternatives are available.

 Site equipment on the construction lot as far away from noisesensitive sites as possible.
 Construct walled enclosures around especially noisy activities or
clusters of noisy equipment. For example, shields can be used
around pavement breakers, and loaded vinyl curtains can be draped
under elevated structures.

 - **Sequence of operations**
 Combine noisy operations to occur in the same time period. The
total noise level produced will not be substantially greater than the
level produced if the operations were performed separately.
 Avoid nighttime activities. Sensitivity to noise increases during the
nighttime hours in residential neighborhoods.

 - **Alternative construction methods**
 Avoid impact pile-driving where possible in noise-sensitive areas.
Drilled piles or the use of a sonic/vibratory pile driver or push pile
driver are quieter alternatives where the geological conditions
permit their use.
 Use specially-quieted equipment, such as quieted and enclosed air
compressors and properly-working mufflers on all engines.
 Select quieter demolition methods. For example, sawing bridge
decks into sections that can be loaded onto trucks results in lower

cumulative noise levels than impact demolition by pavement
breakers.

Include descriptions of how each impacted location will be treated with one
or more mitigation measures in the environmental impact assessment when
possible.

**5b.** Describe and commit to a mitigation plan that will be developed later when
the information is available to make final decisions (not often available during the
project development phase) on all specific mitigation measures. This may be the
case for large, complex projects. The objective of the plan should be to
minimize construction noise using all reasonable (e.g., cost vs. benefit) and
feasible (e.g., possible to construct) means available.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 180

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

Components of a mitigation plan may include some or all of the following
provisions, which should also be specified in construction contracts:

 - **Equipment noise emission limits** - Equipment noise limits are
absolute noise limits applied to generic classes of equipment at a
reference distance (typically 50 ft). The limits should be set no higher
than what is reasonably achievable for well-maintained equipment with
effective mufflers. Lower limits that require source noise control may be
appropriate for certain equipment when needed to minimize community
noise impact, if reasonable and feasible. Provisions could also be
included to require equipment noise certification testing prior to use
on-site.

 - **Lot-line construction noise limits** - Lot-line construction noise

limits are noise limits that apply at the lot-line of specific noise-sensitive
properties. The limits are typically specified in terms of both noise
exposure (usually L eq(t) over a 20-30-minute period) and maximum noise
level. They should be based on local noise ordinances if applicable, as
well as pre-construction baseline noise levels (usually 3 to 5 dB above
the baseline).

 - **Operational and/or equipment restrictions** - Itmay be necessary
to prohibit or restrict certain construction equipment and activities
near residential areas during nighttime hours. This is particularly true
for activities that generate tonal, impulsive, or repetitive sounds, such as
back-up alarms, hoe ram demolition, and pile-driving.

 - **Noise abatement requirements** - In some cases, specifications may
be provided for particular noise control treatments based on the results
of the design analysis and/or prior commitments made to the public by
civic authorities. An example would be the requirement for a temporary
noise barrier to shield a particular community area from noisy
construction activities.

 - **Noise monitoring plan requirements** - Plans can be developed for
pre-project noise monitoring to establish baseline noise levels at
sensitive locations, as well as for periodic equipment and lot-line noise
monitoring during the construction period. The plan should outline the
measurement and reporting methods that will be used to demonstrate
compliance with the project noise limits.

 - **Noise control plan requirements** - For major construction
projects, preparation and submission of noise control plans on a
periodic basis (e.g., every six months) are generally required. These
plans should predict the construction noise at noise-sensitive receiver
locations based on the proposed construction equipment and methods.
If the analysis predicts that the specified noise limits will be exceeded,
the plan should specify the mitigation measures that will be applied and
should demonstrate the expected noise reductions these measures will
achieve. The objective of this proactive approach is to minimize the

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 181

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

likelihood of community noise complaints by ensuring that any
necessary mitigation measures are included in the construction plans.

 - **Compliance enforcement program** - Ifconstruction noise is an
issue in the community, it is important that a program be implemented
to monitor contractor compliance with the noise control specifications
and mitigation plan. It is recommended that this function be performed
by a construction management team on behalf of the public agency.

 - **Public information and complaint response procedures** - To
maintain positive community relations, it is recommended to keep the
public informed about the construction plans and efforts to minimize
noise, and procedures should be established for prompt response and
corrective action to noise complaints during construction.

Most of these provisions are appropriate for large-scale projects, where
construction activity will continue for many months, if not years. The linked
references contain more information on construction noise for major
transportation projects. [(60)(65) ]

7.2 Construction Vibration Assessment

Construction activity can result in varying degrees of ground vibration,
depending on the equipment and methods employed. Operation of construction
equipment causes ground vibrations that spread through the ground and
diminish in strength with distance. Buildings founded on the soil near the
construction site respond to these vibrations with varying results, ranging from
no perceptible effects at the lowest levels, low rumbling sounds and perceptible
vibrations at moderate levels, and slight damage at the highest levels.

While ground vibrations from construction activities do not often reach the
levels that can damage structures, fragile buildings must receive special
consideration. The construction vibration criteria include consideration of the

building condition.

The key elements of the Construction Vibration Assessment procedures and
recommended workflow are as follows:

**Step 1:** Determine level of construction vibration assessment

**Step 2:** Use a qualitative construction vibration assessment

**Step 3:** Use a quantitative construction vibration assessment

**Step 4:** Assess construction vibration impact

**Step 5:** Determine construction vibration mitigation measures

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 182

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Step 1: Determine Level of Construction Vibration**

**Assessment**

_Determine the appropriate level of assessment based on the scale and type of the_
_project and the stage of environmental review._

**1a. Determine if an assessment is required.**
Construction Vibration Assessments are not required for many small projects
including:

 - Installation of safety features like grade-crossing signals

 - Track improvements within the ROW

 - Erecting small buildings and facilities, which are similar in scale to the
surrounding development

**1b. Determine whether a qualitative or quantitative assessmentis**
**required.**

 - **Qualitative Construction Vibration Assessment** - Aqualitative
construction vibration assessment is appropriate for projects where
prolonged annoyance or damage from construction vibration is not
expected. For example, equipment that generates little or no ground
vibration--such as air compressors, light trucks, and hydraulic loaders--
only require qualitative descriptions. See Section 7.2, Step 2 for more
information on qualitative construction vibration assessments.

 - **Quantitative Construction Vibration Assessment** - A
quantitative construction vibration analysis is appropriate for projects
where construction vibration may result in building damage or
prolonged annoyance. For example, activities such as blasting, piledriving, vibratory compaction, demolition, and drilling or excavation
near sensitive structures require a quantitative analysis. See Section 7.2,
Step 3 for more information on quantitative construction vibration

assessments.

If there is uncertainty in how to determine the appropriate level of assessment,
contact the FTA Regional office.

**Step 2: Use a Qualitative Construction Vibration**

**Assessment**

_Use a qualitative construction vibration assessment to estimate vibration for_
_appropriate projects per Section 7.2, Step 1b._

Provide qualitative descriptions in the environmental document of the following
elements:

 - Duration of construction (both overall and at specific locations)

 - Equipment expected to be used

 - Description of how ground-borne vibration will be maintained at an
acceptable level

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 183

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

Note that the criteria in Section 7.2, Step 4 do not apply to qualitative

assessments.

**Step 3: Use a Quantitative Construction Vibration**

**Assessment**

_Use a quantitative construction vibration assessment to estimate vibration for_
_appropriate projects per Section 7.2, Step 1b._

For quantitative construction vibration assessments, follow the recommended
procedure in this step. Vibration source levels from typical construction
equipment and operations are provided below, and procedures on how to
estimate construction vibration for damage and annoyance are provided in Steps
3a and 3b, respectively.

 - **Vibration Source Levels from Construction Equipment** - Table
7-4 presents average source levels in terms of velocity for various types
of construction equipment measured under a wide variety of
construction activities. The approximate rms vibration velocity levels
were calculated from the PPV limits using a crest factor of 4,
representing a PPV-rms difference of 12 dB. Note that although the
table gives one level for each piece of equipment, there is considerable
variation in reported ground vibration levels from construction
activities. The data in Table 7-4 provide a reasonable estimate for a
wide range of soil conditions. [(66)(67)(68)(69) ]

**3a. Damage Assessment**
Assess for building damage for each piece of equipment individually.
Construction vibration is generally assessed in terms of peak particle velocity
(PPV), as described in Section 5.1.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 184

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

 - Determine the vibration source level (PPV ref ) for each piece of
equipment at a reference distance of 25 ft as described above and in
Table 7-4.

 - Use Eq. 7-2 to apply the propagation adjustment to the source
reference level to account for the distance from the equipment to the
receiver. Note that the equation is based on point sources with normal
propagation conditions.

_Assessment with impact criteria to assess impact from construction vibration._

Assess potential damage effects from construction vibration for each piece of
equipment individually. Note that equipment operating at the same time could
increase vibration levels substantially, but predicting any increase could be
difficult. The criteria presented in this section should be used during the
environmental impact assessment phase to identify problem locations that must
be addressed during the engineering phase.

Compare the PPV and approximate L v for each piece of equipment determined
in Section 7.2, Step 3 to the vibration damage criteria in Table 7-5, which is
presented by building/structural category, to assess impact. [(70)(71) ] The
approximate rms vibration velocity levels were calculated from the PPV limits
using a crest factor of 4.

Compare the L v determined in Section 7.2, Step 3 to the criteria for the
General Vibration Assessment in Section 6.2 to assess annoyance or
interference with vibration-sensitive activities due to construction vibration.

**Step 5: Determine Construction Vibration Mitigation**

**Measures**

_Evaluate the need for mitigation and select appropriate mitigation measures where_
_potential human impacts or building damage from construction vibration have been_
_identified according to Section 7.2, Step 4._

**5a.** Determine the appropriate approach for construction vibration mitigation
considering equipment location and processes.

 - **Design considerations and project layout**
 Route heavily-loaded trucks away from residential streets. Select
streets with the fewest homes if no alternatives are available.
 Operate earth-moving equipment on the construction lot as far
away from vibration-sensitive sites as possible.

 - **Sequence of operations**
 Phase demolition, earth-moving, and ground-impacting operations
so as not to occur in the same time period. Unlike noise, the total
vibration level produced could be substantially less when each
vibration source operates separately.
 Avoid nighttime activities. Sensitivity to vibration increases during
the nighttime hours in residential neighborhoods.

 - **Alternative construction methods**

 Carefully consider the use of impact pile-driving versus drilled piles
or the use of a sonic/vibratory pile driver or push pile driver where
those processes might create lower vibration levels if geological
conditions permit their use.

```
 ­
```
Pile-driving is one of the greatest sources of vibration associated
with equipment used during construction of a project. The
source levels in Table 7-4 indicate that sonic pile drivers may
provide substantial reduction of vibration levels compared to
impact pile drivers. But, there are some additional vibration
effects of sonic pile drivers that may limit their use in sensitive
locations.

```
 ­
```

A sonic pile driver operates by continuously shaking the pile at a
fixed frequency, literally vibrating it into the ground. Continuous
operation at a fixed frequency may, however, be more

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 186

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

noticeable to nearby residents, even at lower vibration levels.
Furthermore, the steady-state excitation of the ground may
induce a growth in the resonant response of building
components. Resonant response may be unacceptable in cases
of fragile buildings or vibration-sensitive manufacturing
processes. Impact pile drivers, however, produce a high
vibration level for a short time (0.2 seconds) with sufficient time
between impacts to allow any resonant response to decay.

```
 ­
```
Select demolition methods involving little to no impact, where
possible. For example, sawing bridge decks into sections that
can be loaded onto trucks results in lower vibration levels than

impact demolition by pavement breakers. Milling generates
lower vibration levels than excavation using clam shell or chisel
drops.

```
 ­
```
Avoid vibratory rollers and packers near sensitive areas.

**5b.** Describe and commit to a mitigation plan that will be developed and
implemented during the engineering and construction phase when the
information available during the project development phase will not be sufficient
to define specific construction vibration mitigation measures. The objective of
the plan should be to minimize construction vibration damage using all
reasonable and feasible means available. The plan should include the following
components:

- A procedure for establishing threshold and limiting vibration values for
potentially affected structures, based on an assessment of each structure’s
ability to withstand the loads and displacements due to construction
vibrations

- A commitment to develop a vibration monitoring plan during the
engineering phase and to implement a compliance monitoring program
during construction

Documentation of Noise and

Vibration Assessment

The level of required documentation is determined according to the project
class of action. Section 2.1 covers the appropriate class of action (EIS, EA, or
CE) for different projects. If there is uncertainty in the appropriate level of
documentation, contact the FTA Regional office.

The noise and vibration analysis must be articulated to the public in a clear,
comprehensive manner for all levels of documentation. The technical data and
information necessary to withstand scrutiny in the environmental review
process must be documented in a way that remains intelligible to the public.
Justification for all assumptions used in the analysis, such as selection of
representative measurement sites and all baseline conditions, must be presented
for review.

A separate technical report or memorandum is often prepared as a supplement
to the environmental document. A technical report is appropriate in cases when
including the data from the assessment would create an unreasonably long
environmental document. The details of the analysis are important for
establishing the basis for the assessment. Therefore, all details in the technical
report should be contained in a well-organized format for easy access to the
information.

For large-scale projects, the environmental document should contain a summary
of the essential analysis information to provide subject matter context and the
analysis findings. For these projects, separate technical reports are usually
prepared as supplements to the EIS or EA and referred to in the environmental
document. For smaller projects, or projects with minimal noise or vibration
impact, all of the technical information may be presented in the environmental
document itself or in a technical memorandum. Other projects might have no
potential for noise or vibration impacts. For those projects, that environmental
documentation should explain that no noise or vibration impacts are expected.

This section provides guidance on presenting the necessary noise and vibration
information in the environmental document (Section 8.1) and the associated
technical report (Section 8.2).

8.1 Environmental Document

In the environmental document, provide a summary of the comprehensive noise
and vibration information from the technical report and emphasize the salient
points of the analysis in a format and style that the public can understand.
Smaller projects may have all of the technical information contained within the
environmental document, so take special care in summarizing the technical
details to convey the information adequately.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 188

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Step 1: Choose the Information to Include**

_Choose the appropriate noise and vibration analysis information to include based on_
_the level of environmental review and the associated documentation._

**1a. Provide full disclosure of noise and vibration impacts** in the
environmental document, including identification of locations where impacts
cannot be mitigated below the severe impact level. In general, an EIS describes
significant impacts and plans to mitigate the impacts. For EAs, completion of the
environmental review with a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) may
depend on mitigation being considered for incorporation in the proposed
project. The way mitigation is presented in the environmental document
depends on the type of impact (noise or vibration) and the stage of project
development and environmental review. Projects that meet the criteria of a CE
may also require the completion of a noise and/or vibration analysis, and the
results of such an analysis should be documented in a noise memo or the CE
documentation.

**1b. Document noise impacts** - Typically, airborne noise impacts can be
accurately predicted during the environmental review. For projects that focus
on a single alternative, noise impacts can be accurately identified in the draft
environmental document. If mitigation is anticipated, then mitigation options
should be explored in the EA or draft EIS; firm decisions on mitigation can be
deferred to the final document. But for all projects, decisions on noise
mitigation should be made before the final document is approved.

**1c. Document vibration impacts** - Predicting vibration impacts accurately is
more complex because ground-borne vibration may be strongly influenced by
subsurface conditions. The geotechnical studies that reveal these conditions are
normally undertaken during the engineering phase, after the environmental
review process is complete. Therefore, the final environmental document will
usually not be able to state with certainty whether mitigation is needed for
ground-borne vibration and noise.

If the engineering phase is conducted at the same time as the final environmental
document, report the results of the Detailed Vibration Analysis in the final
environmental document. If the engineering phase is conducted after the final
environmental document, report the results of the General Vibration
Assessment in the final environmental document. If impact is determined,
include a commitment in the final document to conduct a Detailed Vibration

Analysis during the engineering phase to complete the impact assessment. Also,
include a discussion on various control measures that could be used and the
likelihood that the criteria could be met through the use of one or more of the
measures. It may be possible to state a commitment in the final environmental
document to adhere to the impact criteria for the Detailed Vibration Analysis,
while deferring the selection of specific vibration control measures until the
completion of detailed studies in the engineering phase. When work is
conducted after FTA signs its final decision document (i.e., ROD, combined
FEIS/ROD, or FONSI), additional documentation, such as a reevaluation of the
previous decision, may be necessary. FTA recommends contacting the FTA
Regional office directly in these situations.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 189

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**1d. Describe mitigation measures in the decision document** - After the
decision document is approved, incorporate the mitigation measures by
reference in the actual grant agreements signed by FTA and the project sponsor.
The mitigation measures then become contractual conditions that must be
adhered to by the project sponsor.

It is typically appropriate to include the following noise and vibration
information in the environmental document, as described in Section 8.1:

 - The existing conditions (affected environment)

 - The direct impacts from operation (environmental consequences)

 - The construction impacts (environmental consequences)

**Step 2: Organize information in the Environmental**

**Document**

_Include information in the following sections of the environmental document separating_
_out the noise and vibration information._

**2a. Existing Conditions (Affected Environment)** - Describe the existing
conditions (conditions without the project) in terms of the existing noise
and vibration conditions in this section of the document. The primary
function of this section is to establish the focus and baseline conditions for
the discussion of environmental impacts. Include the following basic
information and separate the noise and vibration sections.

 - **Description of noise/vibration metrics, effects and typical levels**
- Include a targeted summary of relevant information from Section 3 of
this manual. This will serve as background for the discussions of
noise/vibration levels and characteristics that will follow in later

sections. Provide illustrative material to convey typical levels to the
public.

 - **Inventory of noise/vibration-sensitive sites** - Describe the
approach for identifying noise- and vibration-sensitive sites as well as the
identified sites and site descriptions. Use sufficient detail to demonstrate
completeness. Document these results on a map.

 - **Noise/vibration measurements** - Document the basis for selecting
measurement sites, including tables of sites coordinated with maps
showing locations of sites. Summarize the measurement approach and
include the justification for the measurement procedures used.

Present measurement data in well-organized tables and figures with a
summary and interpretation of measured data. Measurements are often
included in the table of measurement sites described in the previous
paragraph. In some cases, measurements may be supplemented or
replaced by collected data relevant to the noise and vibration
characteristics of the area. For example, soil information for estimating
ground-borne vibration propagation characteristics may be available
from other projects in the area.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 190

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

A summary and interpretation of how the collected data define the project
setting is fundamental to this section.

**2b. Direct Impacts** - Include the following in the discussion on direct impacts
due to project operation:

 - **Overview of approach** - Provide a targeted summary of relevant
information on the assessment procedure for determining
noise/vibration impacts as a framework for the following sections.

 - **Estimated noise/vibration levels** - Provide a general description of
prediction models used to estimate project noise/vibration levels.
Describe any distinguishing features unique to the project, such as
source levels associated with various technologies.

Describe the results of the predictions in general terms first, followed
by a detailed accounting of predicted noise levels. Supplement this
information with tables and illustrate by contours, cross-sections, or
shaded mapping. If contours are included in a technical report, it is not
necessary to repeat them in this section.

 - **Criteria for noise/vibration impact** - Describe the impact criteria
for the project in detail and reference the appropriate section in this
manual. Include tables listing the criteria levels or the figures included in
this manual.

 - **Noise/vibration impact assessment** - Present the impact
assessment in its own section or combined with the section above.

Describe the locations, as identified in the screening procedure, where
noise/vibration impact is expected to occur without implementation of
mitigation measures, based on the screening results, predicted future
levels, existing levels, and application of the impact criteria.

Include inventory tables of impacted noise- and vibration-sensitive sites
to quantify the impacts for all noise/vibration-sensitive sites included in
the Affected Environment (Existing Conditions) as described in the
Existing Conditions section above.

 - **Noise/vibration mitigation measures** - Perhaps the greatest
difference between the technical report and the environmental
document is with mitigation. The technical report discusses mitigation
options and recommendations, while the environmental document
provides the vehicle for reaching decisions on appropriate mitigation

measures.

Begin this section with a summary of the noise/vibration mitigation
measures considered for the impacted locations. Describe the specific
measures selected for implementation in detail. Also, include any

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 191

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

applicable, specific noise or vibration policies the project sponsor may
have in place.

In cases where it is not possible to commit to a specific mitigation
measure in the final environmental document, it may be possible to
commit to a certain noise/vibration level. For example, the
environmental document could include a commitment to meet or
exceed the impact criteria specified in Sections 4.1 and 6.2.

 - **Unavoidable adverse environmental effects** - Ifitisprojected
that adverse noise/vibration impacts will result after all reasonable
abatement measures have been incorporated, identify these impacts in
this section.

**2c. Construction Impacts** - Discuss construction impacts in the
environmental document’s section on construction impacts, if present.
If, because of the scale of the project, the environmental document does
not have a separate construction impacts section, then the construction
impacts should be discussed with the rest of the resource impacts.

When a special section on construction noise/vibration impacts is
included in the document, it should be organized according to the
comprehensive outline on long-term impacts described above. For
projects with relatively minor effects, include a brief summary of impact.

8.2 Technical Report on Noise and Vibration

The technical report is intended to present complete technical data and
descriptions in a manner that can be understood by the general public, but is
more technical than the information found in the environmental document. All

necessary background information should be present in the technical report,
including tables, maps, charts, drawings, and references that may be too detailed
for the environmental document, but which are important in helping to draw
conclusions about the project's noise and vibration impacts and mitigation
options.

Include the following major subject headings and key information described
below. If both noise and vibration have been assessed, include separate sections
for noise and vibration with subsections for key information as described below.
Additional details on documentation requirements for the technical report of
non-standard procedures and methodologies are included in Appendix G.

 - **Overview** - Include a brief description of the project and an overview
of the noise/vibration concerns to highlight initial considerations in
framing the scope of the study.

 - **Inventory of Noise/Vibration-Sensitive Sites** - Describe the
approach for identifying noise- and vibration-sensitive sites as well as the
identified sites and site descriptions. Use sufficient detail to demonstrate
completeness. Document results on a map.

# Appendix B: Fundamentals of Noise

Noise is generally considered to be unwanted sound. Sound is what we hear when our ears are exposed
to small pressure fluctuations in the air. There are many ways in which pressure fluctuations are
generated, but typically they are caused by vibrating movement of a solid object. This manual uses the
terms noise and sound interchangeably because there is no physical difference between them. Noise can
be described in terms of three variables: amplitude (loud or soft); frequency (pitch); and time pattern
(variability).

B.1 Amplitude

The loudness of a sound is described by the sound wave’s amplitude of pressure fluctuations above and
below atmospheric pressure. Pressure is measured in Pascals. The mean value of the positive and
negative pressure fluctuations is the static atmospheric pressure and is not a useful metric of sound.
However, the effective magnitude of the sound pressure in a sound wave can be expressed by the rms
of the oscillating pressure. See Figure B-1 for an illustration of the rms pressure.

The rms pressure is calculated according to Eq. B-1. The values of sound pressure are squared and timeaveraged to smooth out variations. The rms pressure is the square root of this time-averaged value.

**Eq. B-1**

Most humans with typical or average hearing can perceive sounds ranging from approximately 20
microPascals to 20 million microPascals or more. Because of the difficulty in dealing with such an
extreme range of numbers, acousticians use a logarithmic scale to describe sound levels. Acousticians
use a compressed scale based on logarithms of the ratios of the sound energy contained in the wave
related to the square of sound pressures instead of the sound pressures themselves, resulting in the
“sound pressure level” in decibels (dB). The ‘B’ in dB is always capitalized because the unit is named
after Alexander Graham Bell, a leading 19th century innovator in communication.

Inserting the range of sound pressure values mentioned above into Eq. B-2 results in a typical quietest
sound at 20 microPascals at 0 dB. A typical loudest sound of 20 million microPascals is 120 dB.

B.1.1 Decibel Addition

The combination of two or more sound pressure levels at a single location requires decibel addition,
which is the addition of logarithmic quantities of sound energy (P [2] rms ).

To add sound energy from multiple, unique sources, add the sound energy as shown Eq. B-3.

B.1.2 Frequency

Sound is a fluctuation of air pressure. The number of times the fluctuation occurs in one second is called
its frequency. In acoustics, frequency is quantified in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz). The hearing for a
typical human covers the frequency range from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.

Some sounds, like whistles, are associated with a single frequency; this type of sound is called a pure
tone. However, most often, noise is made up of many frequencies, called a spectrum. Analyzing a noise
spectrum allows for identification of dominant frequency ranges and can assist in identifying noise
sources. Often a frequency spectrum is divided into standardized frequency bands for analysis. Most
commonly, the frequency bands for transit analyses are octave bands (where the interval between two
divisions is a frequency ratio of 2) and one-third octave bands (where the interval between center
frequencies is a ratio of 1.25). [(73) ]

If the spectrum associated with a transit noise source is dominated by many low-frequency components,
the noise will have a characteristic like the rumble of thunder; this is often associated with noise from a
subway. Mid-range frequencies are often associated with wheel/rail noise, and high frequencies may be
associated with wheel squeal due to sharp curves on a track.

The spectrum in Figure B-3 illustrates the full range of acoustical frequencies that can occur near a
transit system. In this example, the noise spectrum was measured near a train on an elevated steel
structure with a sharp curve.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 203

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Figure B-3 Noise Spectrum of Transit Train on Curve and Elevated Structure**

The human auditory system does not respond equally to all frequencies of sound. For sounds normally
heard in our environment, low frequencies below 250 Hz and frequencies above 10,000 Hz are generally
considered less audible than the frequencies in between. This is because our ears are less sensitive in
those areas. To better represent human hearing, frequency response functions were developed to
characterize the way people respond to different frequencies. These are referred to as A-, B-, and Cweighted curves and represent human auditory response to normal, very loud, and extremely loud
sound levels, respectively. Environmental noise is generally considered to be in the normal sound level
range; and, therefore, the A-weighted sound level is considered best to represent the human response.

The A-weighting curve is shown in Figure B-4. This curve illustrates that sounds at 50 Hz would have to
be amplified by 30 dB to be perceived as loud as a sound at 1000 Hz at normal sound levels.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 204

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Figure B-4 A-Weighting Curve**

Low frequencies have longer wavelengths of sound (cycles are less frequent) and, conversely, high
frequencies have shorter wavelengths (cycles are more frequent). The size of the wavelength in feet is
dependent on frequency and speed of sound as follows:

**Eq. B-5**

where

൑ෲ ൛ ൎ

൑ = frequency in cycles per second, Hz

ෲ = wavelength, ft

ൎ = speed of sound, ft/sec

The speed of sound in air varies with temperature; but at standard conditions, it is approximately 1000
ft per second. Therefore, at standard conditions, a frequency of 1000 Hz has a wavelength of 1 foot and
a frequency of 50 Hz has a wavelength of 20 ft. The scale of these waves explains, in part, the reason
humans perceive sounds of 1000 Hz better than those of 50 Hz. A wavelength of 1 foot is similar to the
size of a person’s head; whereas, a wavelength of 20 ft is similar to dimensions associated with a house,
which is why low-frequency sounds (such as those from an idling locomotive) are sometimes not
attenuated by walls and windows of a home. These sounds transmit indoors with relatively little
reduction in strength.

B.1.3 Time Pattern

The third important characteristic of noise is its variation in time. Environmental noise is considered to
be a combination of all outdoor noise sources. When combined, sources such as distant traffic, wind in
trees, and distant industrial or farming activities often create a low-level background noise in which no
particular individual source is identifiable. Background noise is often relatively constant from moment to
moment, but varies slowly over time as natural forces change or as human activity follows its daily cycle.
In addition to this low-level, slowly varying background noise, a succession of identifiable noisy events of
relatively brief duration may be added. These events may include single-vehicle passbys, aircraft flyovers,

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 205

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

screeching of brakes, and other short-term events, which all cause the noise level to substantially
fluctuate from moment to moment.

It is possible to describe these fluctuating noises in the environment using single-number metrics to
allow for manageable measurements, computations, and impact assessment. The search for adequate
single-number noise metrics has encompassed hundreds of attitudinal surveys and laboratory
experiments in addition to decades of practical experience with many alternative metrics.

B.1.4 Noise Metrics

The noise metrics referred to in this manual are described in the sections below.

B.1.4.1 A-weighted Sound Level: The Basic Noise Unit

The basic noise unit for transit noise is the A-weighted sound level and is described in ANSI S1.1-1994
(49). It describes the noise level at the receiver at any moment in time and can be read directly from
noise-monitoring equipment when frequency weighting is set to A-weighting. Figure B-5 shows examples
of typical A-weighted sound levels for both transit and non-transit sources, ranging from approximately
30 dBA (very quiet) to 90 dBA (very loud).

The unit dBA denotes the decibel level is A-weighted. The letter "A" indicates that the sound has been
filtered to reduce the strength of very low and very high-frequency sounds to emulate the human
response to sound levels as described in Appendix B.1.2. This allows for events that are out of the range
of human hearing, such as high-frequency dog whistles and low-frequency seismic disturbances, to be
filtered out. On average, each A-weighted sound level increase of 10 dB corresponds to an approximate
doubling of subjective loudness.

A-weighted sound levels are adopted as the basic noise unit for transit noise impact assessments
because they:

 - Can be measured easily,

 - Approximate the human ear's sensitivity to sounds of different frequencies,

 - Match attitudinal-survey tests of annoyance better than other basic units,

 - Have been in use since the early 1930s, and

 - Are endorsed as the proper basic unit for environmental noise by most agencies concerned with
community noise throughout the world.

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Figure B-5 Typical A-weighted Sound Levels**

L max
B.1.4.2 Maximum Sound Level ( ) During a Single Noise Event

As a transit vehicle approaches, passes by, and then recedes into the distance, the A-weighted sound
level rises, reaches a maximum, and then fades into the background noise. The maximum A-weighted
sound level reached during this passby is called the maximum sound level, [(49) ] abbreviated here as L max .
L max is illustrated in Figure B-6 where time is plotted horizontally, and A-weighted sound level is plotted
vertically.

Although L max is commonly used in vehicle-noise specifications, [xvi ] it is not used for transit environmental
noise impact assessment. L max does not include the number and duration of transit events, which are
important for assessing people's reactions to noise. It also cannot be normalized to a one-hour or
24-hour cumulative measure of impact, and therefore, is not conducive to comparison among different
transportation modes. For example, cumulative noise metrics commonly used in highway noise
assessments are L eq(1hr) and L 10, the noise level exceeded for 10 percent of the peak hour.

xvi For noise compliance tests of transient sources, such as moving transit vehicles under controlled conditions with smooth
wheel and rail conditions, L max is typically measured with the sound level meter's time weighting set to "fast." However, for
tests of continuous or stationary transit sources, it is usually more appropriate to use the "slow" setting. When set to "slow,"
sound level meters ignore some of the very-transient fluctuations, which are negligible when assessing the overall noise level.

TRANSIT NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT MANUAL

**Figure B-6 Typical Transit-Vehicle Passby**

B.1.4.3 Sound Exposure Level (SEL): Exposure from a Single

Noise Event

Sound exposure level, abbreviated here as SEL, is the cumulative noise exposure from a single noise
event, normalized to one second (49). SEL contains the same overall sound energy as the actual varying
sound energy during the event. It is the primary metric for the measurement of transit vehicle noise
emissions and an intermediate metric in the measurement and calculation of both L eq(1hr) and L dn . The SEL
metric is A-weighted and is expressed in the unit dBA.

This concept is illustrated in Figure B-6 and Figure B-7 where the shaded regions are the sound
exposure during and event. The example in Figure B-6 is a transit-vehicle passby and Figure B-7 is an
example of a fixed-transit facility as a transit bus is started, warmed up, and then driven away. For this
event, the noise exposure is large due to duration of the event.

SEL is an A-weighted cumulative measure that is referenced to one second. Louder events have greater
SELs than quieter events, and events of longer duration have greater SELs than shorter events. This is
generally consistent with community response to noise. Noise events of longer duration are considered
more disruptive than events of shorter duration with equal maximum A-weighted sound levels.

The events shown in Figure B-6 and Figure B-7 are compared graphically in Figure B-8 using a
logarithmic vertical scale. The shaded zones in these figures indicate noise exposure over time. The
actual event shows the noise exposure over the time of the event, and the equivalent SEL shows the
total noise exposure normalized to one second. Note that events 1 and 2 in Figure B-8 have different
time periods and noise levels throughout the event, but the same resulting SEL.

SEL is used in transit noise analyses because it:
1. Accounts for both the duration and amplitude of an event,
2. Allows a uniform assessment method for both transit-vehicle passbys and fixed-facility noise
events, and
3. Can be used to calculate the one-hour and 24-hour cumulative metrics for comparison across
different transportation modes.

**Figure B-8 An Energy View of Noise Events**

B.1.4.4 Equivalent Sound Level (L eq(t) )

The metric for cumulative noise exposure over a specific time interval is the equivalent sound level (49).
It is a single decibel value that accounts for total sound energy from all sound levels over a specified time
interval (or time period). The time period associated with the equivalent sound level metric can vary for
different types of analyses. This metric is abbreviated as L eq(t), where “t” is the duration of the time
period. L eq(t) represents a hypothetical constant sound level and contains the same overall sound energy
as the actual varying sound energy during the time period “t”. For most transit noise analyses, an Aweighted, hourly equivalent sound level is used, abbreviated here as L eq(1hr) . L eq(1hr) is expressed in the unit,
dBA.

Figure B-9 shows examples of typical unmitigated hourly L eq(1hr) 's, both for transit and non-transit sources
ranging from 40 (quiet) to 80 dB (loud). Note that these L eq(1hr) 's depend upon both the number of
events during the hour as well as each event's duration, which is affected by vehicle speed. For example,
doubling the number of events during the hour will increase the L eq(1hr) by 3 decibels, as will doubling the
duration of each individual event.

noise. The equivalent sound level is shown for three different time periods Figure B-10. The area under
the curve in this top frame is the noise that reaches the receiver (noise exposure) over this five-minute
period. The center frame of the figure shows sound levels over the one-hour period, including the fiveminute period from the top frame. The area under the curve represents the noise exposure for one
hour. The bottom frame shows sound levels over a full 24-hour period and is discussed in Appendix

this noise metric can be used for directly comparing and contrasting highway, transit, and
multimodal alternatives).

B.1.4.5 Day-Night Sound Level (L dn ): 24-Hour Exposure from

All Events

The metric for cumulative 24-hour exposure is the Day-Night Sound Level, [(49) ] abbreviated here as L dn .
It is a single, A-weighted decibel value that accounts for total sound energy from all sound sources over
24 hours and is expressed in the unit, dBA. Events between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. are increased by 10 dB to
account for people’s greater nighttime sensitivity to noise.

Figure B-11 shows examples of typical L dn 's, both for transit and non-transit sources, ranging from 50 to
80 dB, where 50 is considered a quiet 24-hour period and 80 a loud 24-hour period. Note that these
L dn 's depend upon the number of events during day and night separately, including each event's duration,
which is affected by vehicle speed.

**Figure B- 11 Typical L** **dn** **'s**

An example of sound level variation over 24 hours is visualized in the bottom frame of Figure B-10. The
area under the curve represents the receiver's noise exposure over the 24 hours. Note that some
vehicle passbys occur at night, when the background noise is typically lower and the 10 dB adjustment is
applied.

Conceptually, the day-night level can be expressed as:

The sound energy is totaled over a full 24 hours, and the sound energy is accumulated from all noise

L dn due to a series of transit-noise events can also be computed in terms of SEL. The equation below
assumes that transit noise dominates the 24-hour noise environment, where nighttime SELs are
increased by 10 dB before totaling:

**Eq. B-11**

L dn is adopted as the measure of cumulative noise impact for residential land uses (those involving sleep),
because it:

 - Correlates well with the results of attitudinal surveys of residential noise impact

 - Increases with the duration of transit events

 - Accounts for the number of transit events over the full twenty-four hours

 - Accounts for the increased sensitivity to noise at night, when most people are asleep

 - Allows composite measurements to capture all sources of community noise combined

 - Allow quantitative comparison of transit noise with other community noises

 - Is the designated metric of choice of other Federal agencies (e.g., HUD, FAA, and EPA) and has
wide international acceptance

# Appendix C: Background for Transit Noise Impact

Criteria

The noise criteria presented in Section 4.1 of this manual have been developed based on welldocumented criteria and research on human response to community noise. The primary goals in
developing the noise criteria were to ensure that the impact limits are firmly founded in scientific
studies, realistically based on noise levels associated with new transit projects, and represent a
reasonable balance between community benefit and project costs. This appendix provides background
information on the development of these criteria.

C.1 Relevant Literature

The following is an annotated list of the documents that are particularly relevant to the noise impact
criteria:

1. **U.S. EPA’s** **"Levels Document”** [(74) ]
This report identifies noise levels consistent with the protection of public health and welfare
against hearing loss, annoyance, and activity interference. It has been used as the basis of
numerous community noise standards and ordinances.

2. **Committee on Hearing, Bioacoustics and Biomechanics (CHABA) Working Group**
**69, "Guidelines for Preparing Environmental Impact Statements on Noise”** [(75) ]
This report was the result of deliberations by a group of leading acoustical scientists with the
goal of developing a uniform national method for noise impact assessment. Although the
CHABA's proposed approach has not been adopted, the report serves as an excellent resource
documenting research in noise effects. It provides a strong scientific basis for quantifying impacts
in terms of L dn .

3. **American Public Transportation Association (APTA) Guidelines for Design of Rapid**
**Transit Facilities** [(76) ]

The noise and vibration sections of the APTA Guidelines have been used successfully in the past
for the design of rail transit facilities. The APTA Guidelines include criteria for acceptable
community noise and vibration. Experience has shown that meeting the APTA Guidelines will
usually result in acceptable noise levels; but the metric used in the APTA Guidelines is not
appropriate for environmental assessment purposes.

The APTA Guidelines criteria are in terms of L max for conventional RRT vehicles, and they
cannot be used to compare among different modes of transit. Since the APTA Guidelines are
expressed in terms of maximum passby noise, they are not sensitive to the frequency or
duration of noise events for transit modes other than conventional RRT operations with 5 to 10
minute headways. Therefore, the APTA criteria are questionable for assessing the noise impact
of other transit modes that differ from conventional rapid transit with respect to source
emission levels and operating characteristics (e.g., commuter rail, AGT, and a variety of bus
projects).

4. **Synthesis of Social Surveys on Noise Annoyance** [(77) ]
In 1978, Theodore J. Schultz, an internationally known acoustical scientist, synthesized the
results of a large number of social surveys concerning annoyance due to transportation noise. A
group of these surveys were remarkably consistent, and the author proposed that their average

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 217

results be taken as the best available prediction of transportation noise annoyance. This
synthesis has received essentially unanimous acceptance by acoustical scientists and engineers.
The "universal" transportation response curve developed by Schultz (Figure 3-7) shows that the
percent of the population highly annoyed by transportation noise increases from zero at an L dn
of approximately 50 dBA to 100% when L dn is approximately 90 dBA. Most importantly, this
curve indicates that for the same increase in L dn, there is a greater increase in the number of
people highly annoyed at high noise levels than at low noise levels. For example, a 5 dB increase
at low ambient levels (40 - 50 dB) has less impact than at higher ambient levels (65 - 75 dB). A
recent update of the original research containing several railroad, transit, and street traffic noise
surveys, confirming the shape of the original Schultz curve [(12)] .

5. **HUD’s** **Standards** [(19) ]

HUD has developed noise standards, criteria, and guidelines to ensure that housing projects
supported by HUD achieve the goal of a suitable living environment. The HUD acceptability
standards define 65 dB (L dn ) as the threshold for a normally unacceptable living environment
(moderate impact for FTA) and 75 dB (L dn ) as the threshold for an unacceptable living
environment (severe impact for FTA).

C.2 Basis for Noise Impact Criteria Curves

The lower curve in Figure 4-2 represents the onset of moderate impact and is based on the following
considerations:

 - The EPA finding that a community noise level of L dn less than or equal to 55 dBA is "requisite to
protect public health and welfare with an adequate margin of safety." [(72) ]

 - The conclusion by EPA and others that a 5 dB increase in L dn or L eq(1hr) is the minimum required
for a change in community reaction.

 - The research concludes that there are very few people highly annoyed when the L dn is 50 dBA,
and that an increase in L dn from 50 dBA to 55 dBA results in an average of 2% more people
highly annoyed (Figure 3-7).

The increase in noise level from an existing ambient level of 50 dBA to a cumulative level of 55 dBA
because of a project is found to cause minimal impact, with 2% of people highly annoyed, as described in
the bullets above. This is considered the lowest threshold where impact starts to occur. Therefore, for
an existing ambient noise level of 50 dBA, the curve representing the onset of moderate impact is at 53
dBA, the combination of which yields a cumulative level of 55 dBA by decibel addition. The remainder of
the lower curve in Figure 4-2 was determined from the annoyance curve (Figure 3-7) by allowing a fixed
2% increase in annoyance at other levels of existing ambient noise. As cumulative noise increases, the
increment to attain the same 2% increase in highly annoyed people is smaller. While it takes a 5-dB
noise increase to cause a 2% increase in highly annoyed people at an existing ambient noise level of 50
dB, an increase of only 1 dB causes a 2% increase of highly annoyed people at an existing ambient noise
level of 70 dBA.

The upper curve in Figure 4-2 represents the onset of severe impact based on a total noise level,
corresponding to a higher degree of impact. The severe noise impact curve is based on the following
considerations:

 - HUD defines an L dn of 65 as the onset of a normally unacceptable noise zone (moderate impact
for FTA) in its environmental noise standards [(19)] . FAA considers that residential land uses are
not compatible with noise environments where L dn is greater than 65 dBA (20).

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 218

 - An increase of 5 dB in L dn or L eq(t) is commonly assumed as the minimum required increase for a
change in community reaction.

 - The research concludes that an increase of 5 dB in L dn or L eq(t) represents a 6.5% increase in the
number of people highly annoyed (Figure 3-7).

The increase in noise level from an existing ambient level of 60 dBA to a cumulative level of 65 dBA
caused by a project represents a change from an acceptable noise environment to the threshold of an
unacceptable noise environment. This is considered the level at which severe impact starts to occur
with a 6.5% increase in the number of people highly annoyed as described in the bullets above.
Therefore, for an existing ambient noise level of 60 dBA, the curve representing the onset of severe
impact is at 63 dBA, the combination of which yields a cumulative level of 65 dBA by decibel addition.
The remainder of the upper curve in Figure 4-2 was determined from the annoyance curve (Figure 3-7)
by allowing a fixed increase of the 6.5% increase in annoyance at all existing ambient noise levels.

Both curves incorporate a maximum limit for the transit project noise in noise-sensitive areas.
Independent of existing noise levels, moderate impact for land use categories 1 and 2 is considered to
occur whenever the transit L dn equals or exceeds 65 dBA, and severe impact occurs whenever the
transit L dn equals or exceeds 75 dBA. These absolute limits are intended to restrict activity interference
caused by the transit project alone.

Both curves also incorporate a maximum limit for cumulative noise increase at low existing noise levels
(below approximately 45 dBA). This is a conservative limit that reflects the lack of social survey data on
people's reactions to noise at such low ambient levels. Like the FHWA approach in assessing the relative
impact of a highway project, the transit noise criteria include limits on noise increase of 10 dB and 15 dB
for moderate impact and severe impact, respectively, relative to the existing noise level.

Note that due to the types of land use included in category 3, the criteria allow the project noise for
category 3 sites to be 5 dB greater than for category 1 and category 2 sites. This difference is reflected
by the offset in the vertical scale on the right side of Figure 4-2. Aside from active parks, which are
clearly less sensitive to noise than category 1 and 2 sites, category 3 sites include primarily indoor
activities. Therefore, the criteria account for some noise reduction from the building structure.

C.3 Equations for Noise Impact Criteria Curves

The equations for the noise impact criteria curves shown in Figure 4-2 are included in this section.
These equations may be useful when performing the noise assessment methodology using spreadsheets,
computer programs, or other analysis tools. Otherwise, such mathematical detail is generally not
necessary to implement the criteria, and direct use of Figure 4-2 is adequate and less time-consuming.

A total of four continuous curves are included in the criteria, creating two threshold curves for
moderate and severe impact for category 1 and 2, and two curves for category 3 (See Table C-1). Note
that for each level of impact, the overall curves for categories 1 and 2 are offset by 5 dB from category
3. While each curve is graphically continuous, each one is defined by a set of three discrete equations.
These equations are approximately continuous at the transition points. The following is a description of
the three equations:

 - The first equation in each set is a linear relationship, representing the portion of the curve in
which the existing noise exposure is low, and the allowable increase is limited to 10 dB and 15
dB for moderate impact and severe impact, respectively.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 219

 - The second equation in each set represents the impact threshold over the range of existing
noise exposure for which a fixed percentage of increase in annoyance is allowed, as described in
Appendix C.2. This curve is a third-order, polynomial approximation derived from the Schultz
curve [(75) ] and covers the range of noise exposure encountered in most populated areas. This
curve is used for determining noise impact in most cases for transit projects.

 - The third equation represents the absolute limit of project noise imposed by the criteria for
areas with high existing noise exposure. For land use category 1 and 2, the absolute limit is 65
dBA for moderate impact and 70 dBA for severe impact. For land use category 3, the absolute
limit is 75 dBA for moderate impact and 80 dBA for severe impact.

# Appendix D: Clustering Receivers of Interest

This appendix supplements the information in Section 4.5 on clustering receivers of interest.

The general approach to selecting noise-sensitive receivers in the study area is included in Section 4.5,
Step 1. General guidelines are as follows:

 - Select the following types of receivers to evaluate individually:
 Every major noise-sensitive public building
 Every isolated residence
 Every relatively small outdoor noise-sensitive area

 - Residential neighborhoods and relatively large outdoor noise-sensitive areas can often be
clustered and represented by a single receiver.

Clustering similar receivers reduces the number of computations needed later, especially for large-scale
projects where a greater number of noise-sensitive sites may be affected. For this approach to be
effective, it is essential that the representative receiver accurately represents the noise environment of
the cluster.

The major steps in clustering receivers include:

1. First, cluster receivers according to approximately equal exposure to the primary project noise
source. These areas typically run parallel to a linear project or circle major stationary sources
relative to the proposed project.
2. Next, cluster receivers according to major sources of ambient noise. These areas typically run
parallel to or encircle major sources of ambient noise.
3. Then, cluster receivers according to changes in the project layout or operations along the
corridor.
4. Finally, select a representative receiver for each cluster.

The major steps are expanded below and include instructions on how to draw cluster boundaries on a

map.

1. **Boundaries along the proposed project** - Draw cluster boundaries along the proposed project
as described below to separate clusters based on distance from the project. Draw these cluster
boundaries for the project sources listed as major in Table 4-19.

**Within both residential and noise-sensitive outdoor areas:**

 - **Primary project source**
Draw cluster boundaries at the following distances from the near edge of the primary
project source: 0 ft, 50 ft, 100 ft, 200 ft, 400 ft, and 800 ft. For linear sources, such as a rail
line, draw these boundaries as lines parallel to the proposed ROW line. For stationary
sources, draw these boundaries as approximate circles around the source, starting at the
property line.

Do not extend boundaries beyond the noise study area, identified in the Noise Screening
Procedure in Section 4.3 or the General Noise Assessment of Section 4.4.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 221

 - **Remaining project sources** - Repeat the process for the primary project source for all other
project listed as major in Table 4-19, such as substations and crossing signals. If several project
sources are located approximately together, only consider one source, since the others would
produce approximately the same boundary.

It is good practice to optimize the number of clusters for a project to simplify the procedure.

**Where rows of buildings parallel the transit corridor:**

 - Ensure that cluster boundaries fall between the following rows of buildings, counting back
away from the proposed project:
 Between rows 1 and 2

 Between rows 2 and 3

 Between rows 3 and 4

 - Add cluster boundaries between these rows if not already included.

2. **Boundaries along sources of ambient noise** - Draw cluster boundaries along all major sources
of ambient noise based upon distance from these sources, as described below.

 - Draw cluster boundaries along all interstates and major roadway arterials at the following
distances from the near edge of the roadway: 0 ft, 100 ft, 200 ft, and 500 ft.

 - Draw cluster boundaries along all other roadways that have state or county numbering at 0 ft
and 100 ft from the near edge of the roadway.

 - For all major industrial sources of noise, draw cluster boundaries that encircle the source at the
following distances from the near property line of the source: 0 ft, 100 ft, 200 ft, and 400 ft.

3. **Boundaries based on changes in project layout or operations** - Further subdivision is
needed to account for changes in project noise where proposed project layout or operating
conditions change considerably along the corridor. Draw a cluster boundary perpendicular to the
corridor extending straight outward to both sides at the following locations:

 - Where parallel tracks previously separated by more than approximately 100 ft are moved closer
together

 - Approximately where speed and/or throttle are reduced when approaching stations and where
steady service speed is reached after departing stations

 - Approximately 200 ft up and down the line from grade crossing bells

 - At transitions from jointed to welded rail

 - At transitions from one type of cross section to another including on structure, on fill, at-grade
and in cut

 - At transitions from open terrain to heavily wooded terrain

 - At transitions between areas free of locomotive horn noise and areas subject to this noise

source

 - Any other positions along the line where project noise is expected to change considerably, such
as up and down the line from tight curves where wheels may squeal

4. **Selection ofarepresentative receiver from each cluster** - Determine a representative
receiver for each cluster boundary drawn in the steps above.

 - **Residential clusters**
Select a representative receiver within the cluster at the house closest to the proposed project.
If this receiver is not the clear choice, select the receiver furthest from major sources of
ambient noise.

 - **Outdoor noise-sensitive clusters (e.g., urban park or amphitheater)**

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 222

Select a representative receiver within the cluster at the closest point of active noise-sensitive
use. If this receiver is not the clear choice, select the receiver farther from major sources of
ambient noise.

Note that some clusters may fall between areas with receivers of interest. This could occur when
operational changes or track layouts change in an open, undeveloped area. Retain these clusters. Do not
merge them with adjacent clusters. Do not select a representative receiver of interest from them.

# Appendix E: Determining Existing Noise

Different options of determining existing noise, including full measurement, computation from partial
measurements, and tabular look-up, are described in Section 4.5, Step 5. This appendix provides
additional details associated with each method and examples of when each method could be used.

Additional details on the methods for estimating existing noise are provided below:

**Option 1: L** **eq(1hr)** **measurement (non-residential)** - Full one-hour measurements are
recommended to determine existing noise for non-residential receivers of interest. These
measurements are preferred over all other options and will accurately represent the L eq(1hr) . The
following procedures apply to these full-duration measurements:

 - Measure L eq(1hr) atthe receiver of interest during a typical hour of use on two non-successive
days. Choose the hour in which maximum project activity will occur. The L eq(1hr) will be
accurately represented using this method. Typically, measuring between noon Monday and noon
Friday is recommended, but weekend days may be more appropriate for places of worship.

 - Position the measurement microphone for all sites as shown in Figure 4-19, considering relative
orientation of project and ambient sources. Position the microphone in a location that is
somewhat shielded from the ambient source to measure the ambient noise at these locations at

the quietest area on the property.

 - Conduct all measurements in accordance with good engineering practice.

**Option 2: L** **dn** **measurement (residential)-** Full 24-hour measurements are recommended to
determine ambient noise for residential receivers of interest. These measurements are preferred over
all other options and will accurately represent the L dn . The following procedures apply to these fullduration measurements:

 - Measure a full 24-hour L dn at the receiver of interest for a single weekday (generally between
noon Monday and noon Friday).

 - Position the measurement microphone for all sites as shown in Figure 4-19 considering relative
orientation of project and ambient sources. Position the microphone in a location that is
somewhat shielded from the ambient source to measure the ambient noise at these locations at

the quietest area on the property.

 - Conduct all measurements in accordance with good engineering practice.

**Option 3: L** **dn** **computation of L** **dn** **from3partial L** **eq(1hr)** **measurements (residential)** - An
alternative way to determine L dn is to measure L eq(1hr) for three typical hours of the day, then compute
the L dn from these three L eq(1hr) measurements. This method is less precise than its full-duration
measurement. The following procedures apply to this partial-duration measurement method for L dn :

 - Measure the L eq(1hr) during each of the following time periods:
 During peak-hour roadway traffic
 Midday, between the morning and afternoon roadway-traffic peak hours
 During late night between midnight and 5 a.m.

 - Position the measurement microphone for all sites as shown in Figure 4-19 considering relative
orientation of project and ambient sources. Position the microphone in a location that is
somewhat shielded from the ambient source to measure the ambient noise at these locations at

the quietest area on the property.

 - Conduct all measurements in accordance with good engineering practice.

 - Compute the L dn using the equation below

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 225

ഽ ෦෰ ൝ංඁඝච඘⁡(඄ൗංඁ ු ෟ෫ෳ෪ෟෛ෥෢෩෯෬ ൄൃ ෳൎ൅ ൔංඃൗංඁ ු ෟ෫ෳ෧෣ෞෞෛ ൄൃ ෳ ൎ൅ ൔඊൗංඁ ු ෟ෫ෳ෦ෛ෮ෟ෨෣ ൄൃ ෡෢෮ ്ോ ) ൕං඄ෳඉ **Eq. E-1**

The resulting L dn will be slightly underestimated due to the adjustment to the measured levels in these
equations. This underestimation is intended to compensate for the reduced precision of the computed
L dn . If using this method, a minimum time duration of one hour should be used for each measurement
period in computing an Ldn.

**Option 4: Computation of L** **dn** **from 1 partial L** **eq(1hr)** **measurement (residential)** - L dn can also
be determined by measuring L eq(1hr) for one hour of the day, and then computing L dn from the L eq(1hr) .
This method is less precise than computing L dn from 3 L eq(1hr) measurements. This method may be useful
for projects with are many sites assessed by the General Noise Assessment. This method may also be
appropriate when determining if a particular receiver of interest represents a cluster in a Detailed Noise
Analysis. The following procedures apply to this partial-duration measurement option for L dn :

 - Measure the L eq(1hr) for the loudest hour of project-related activity during hours of noise
sensitivity . If this hour is not selected, other hours may be used with the understanding that the
estimate is less precise.

 - Position the measurement microphone for all sites as shown in Figure 4-19, considering relative
orientation of project and ambient sources. Position the microphone in a location that is
somewhat shielded from the ambient source to measure the ambient noise at these locations at

the quietest area on the property.

 - Conduct all measurements in accordance with good engineering practice.

 - Convert the measured hourly L eq(1hr) to L dn with the appropriate equation below.

For measurements between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.:

ഽ ෦෰ ൝ഽ ෧ෳ ൕඃ

For measurements between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m.:
ഽ ෦෰ ൝ഽ ෧ෳ ൔ඄

For measurements between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.:
ഽ ෦෰ ൝ഽ ෧ෳ ൔඉ

**Eq. E-2**

**Eq. E-3**

**Eq. E-4**

The resulting L dn will be moderately underestimated due to the use of the adjustment constants in these
equations. This underestimation is intended to compensate for the reduced precision of the computed
L dn . If using this method, a minimum time duration of one hour should be used for each measurement
period in computing an Ldn.

**Option 5: Computation of L** **eq(1hr)** **or L** **dn** **from L** **eq(1hr)** **or L** **dn** **ofacomparable site (all land**
**uses)** - Computing L eq(1hr) or L dn from the L eq(1hr) or L dn of a comparable site where the ambient noise is
dominated by the same source that is comparable in precision to Option 4. This method can be used to
characterize noise in several neighborhoods by using a single representative receiver. It is critical that
the measurement site has a similar noise environment to all areas represented. If measurements made
by others are available and the sites are equivalent, the existing measurements can be used to reduce
the amount of project noise monitoring. The following procedures apply to this method of determining
of ambient noise:

 - Choose another receiver that is comparable to the receiver (CompRec) of interest with the
following:
 The same source of dominant ambient noise

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 226

 The ambient level of the comparable receiver was measured according to Option 1 or
Option 2 above
 The ambient measurement at the comparable receiver was made in direct view of the major
source of ambient noise, unshielded by noise barriers, terrain, rows of buildings, or dense

tree zones

 - Determine the following from a plan or aerial photograph:
 The distance (D CompRec ) from the comparable receiver to the near edge of the ambient

source
 The distance (D Rec ) from this receiver of interest to the near edge of the ambient source

 - Determine the number of rows of buildings (N) that intervene between the receiver of interest
and the ambient source.

 - Compute the ambient level at the receiver of interest (Rec) with the appropriate equation
below

If roadway sources dominate:
വ ේ෧෥
ഽ ේ෧෥ ൝ ഽ ෋෱෯ෲේ෧෥ ൕ ංආඝච඘⁡ ~~(~~ വ ~~)~~ ൕ ඄ി **Eq. E-5**
෋෱෯ෲේ෧෥

If other sources dominate:

෋෱෯ෲේ෧෥

The resulting L Rec will be moderately underestimated. This underestimation is intended to compensate
for the reduced precision of the computed L dn .

**Option 6: Estimation of L** **dn** **by table look-up (all land uses)** - The least precise way to determine
the ambient noise is to estimate the level using a table. A tabular look-up can be used to establish
baseline conditions for a General Noise Assessment if a noise measurement cannot be made. This

method should not be used for a Detailed Noise Analysis. The following instruction applies to this
method of determining of ambient noise:

Estimate either the L eq(1hr) or the L dn using Table 4-17 based on distance from major roadways, rail lines,
or upon population densities. In general, these tabulated values are substantially underestimated.

The underestimation is intended to compensate for the reduced precision of the estimated ambients.

**Examples-** Examples of when each method of determining existing noise may be appropriate are
provided below using the example from Appendix D. Existing noise at the receivers labeled “REC” in
Figure D-1 could be estimated as follows:

 - **Option 1: L** **eq(1hr)** **measurement** - Existing noise at REC 1 is due to the highway at the side
of this church. L eq(1hr) can be measured during a typical church hour.

 - **Option 2: L** **dn** **measurement -** Existing noise at the residence REC 2 is due to a combination
of the highway and local streets. L dn can be measured for a full 24-hours.

 - **Option 3: L** **dn** **computation of L** **dn** **from3partial L** **eq(1hr)** **measurements** - Existing noise
at the residence REC 3 is due to the street in front of this residence. L dn can be computed from
three L eq(1hr) measurements.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 227

- **Option 4: Computation of L** **dn** **from 1 partial L** **eq(1hr)** **measurement** - Existing noise at
the residence REC 4 is due to the highway. Because the highway has a predictable diurnal
pattern, L dn can be computed from one L eq(1hr) measurement.

- **Option 5: Computation of L** **dn** **from L** **dn** **ofacomparable site** - Existing noise at the
residence REC 5 is due to Kee Street. REC 3 is also affected by local street traffic and is a
comparable distance from the highway. L dn for REC 5 can be computed based on the L dn at
REC-3.

- **Option 6: Estimation of L** **dn** **by table look-up** - Existing noise at the residence REC 6 is due
to local traffic. L dn can be estimated by tables based on population density along this corridor.

# Appendix F: Computing Source Levels from

Measurements

This appendix contains the procedures for computing source reference levels (SEL ref ) from source
measurements in cases where the source reference tables in Section 4.5, Step 2 indicate measurements
are preferred, data are not available for the source of interest, or more precise data are required than
available in the table.

Close-by source measurements for vehicle passbys may capture either the vehicle's sound exposure
level (SEL) or maximum noise level (L max ). Both metrics can be measured directly by commonly available
sound level meters. While the L max metric is not used for transit noise impact assessments, it can be
used to compute SEL source reference levels. L max measurements are often available from transitequipment manufacturers and some transit system equipment specifications may limit close-by L max
levels.

Close-by source measurements for stationary sources capture the source’s SEL over one source event,
where the event duration may be chosen based on measurement convenience. The duration will factor
out of the computation when the measured value is converted to reference operating conditions.

This manual does not specify elaborate methods for undertaking the close-by source measurements, but
rather, provides general processes. It is required that all measurements conform to good engineering
practice, guided by the standards of the American National Standards Institute and other such
organizations (27, 28, 29).

This appendix presents information according to noise source as follows:

 - Appendix F.1: Highway and rail vehicle passbys for vehicles of the same type

 - Appendix F.2: Stationary sources

 Appendix F.3: L max for single train passbys (for trains of mixed consists)

F. 1 Highway and Rail Vehicle Passbys
This section provides information on appropriate conditions for vehicle passby measurements,
instructions on converting measurements made under non-reference conditions to source reference
levels, and examples of these computations.

The following conditions are required for vehicle passbys, in addition to good engineering practice:

 - Measured vehicles must be representative of project vehicles in all aspects, including
representative acceleration and speed conditions for buses.

 - Track must be relatively free of corrugations and train wheels relatively free of flats, unless
these conditions are typical of the proposed project.

 - Road surfaces must be smooth and dry, unless these conditions are typical of the proposed
project.

 - Perpendicular distance between the measurement position and the source's centerline must be
100 ft or less.

 - Vehicle speed must be 30 mph or greater, unless typical project speeds are less than that.

 - No noise barriers, terrain, buildings, or dense tree zones may break the lines-of-sight between
the source and the measurement position.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 229

When close-by source measurements are made under non-reference conditions, use the instructions
below and the equations in Table F-1 to convert the measured values to source reference levels. For rail
vehicles, measure/convert a group of locomotives or a group of cars separately. This computation
requires that all measured vehicles be of the same type. For trains of mixed consists, see Appendix F.3.

F.2 Stationary Sources

This section provides information on appropriate conditions for stationary source measurements,
instructions on converting measurements made under non-reference conditions to source reference
levels, and an example of this type of computation.

The following conditions are required for stationary sources, in addition to good engineering practice:

 - Measured source operations must be representative of project operations in all aspects.

 - The following ratio must be 2 or less, and the distance to the closest source component must
be 200 ft or less.

෌෫෵෶෣෰෥෧⁡෶෱⁡෶෪෧⁡෨෣෴෶෪෧෵෶⁡෵෱෷෴෥෧⁡෥෱෯ෲ෱෰෧෰෶

If both conditions cannot simultaneously be met, separate close-by measurements of individual
components of this source must be made, for which these distance conditions can be met.

 - The following ratio must be 2 or less:

ු෣෶෧෴෣෮⁡෮෧෰෩෶෪⁡෱෨⁡෶෪෧⁡෵෱෷෴෥෧⁡෣෴෧෣

The lateral length of the source area is measured perpendicular to the general line-of-sight
between source and measurement positions.

If this condition cannot be met, then make separate close-by measurements of individual
components of this source, for which this condition can be met.

 - No noise barriers, terrain, buildings, or dense tree zones may break the lines-of-sight between
the source and the measurement position.

When close-by source measurements are made under non-reference conditions, use the instructions
below and the equation in Table F- 2 to convert the measured values to source reference levels.

# Appendix G: Non-Standard Modeling Procedures and

Methodology

This manual provides guidance for preparing and reviewing the noise and vibration sections of
environmental documents, as well as FTA-approved methods and procedures to determine the level of
noise and vibration impact resulting from most federally-funded transit projects. Situations may arise,
however, that are not explicitly covered in this manual. Professional judgment may be used to extend
the basic methods to cover these cases, when appropriate. It is important to note that each project is
unique and must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. This appendix provides procedures for the use of
non-standard noise and vibration modeling procedures and methodologies on public transportation
projects.

**Submittal Procedure** - The procedure for using non-standard modeling procedures and
methodology is as follows:

1. The transit project manager should contact the FTA Regional office to discuss the proposed
methods and/or data not described in this manual prior to use of the non-standard approach.
2. The non-standard methodology should be documented according to the guidelines below as
part of the technical report described in Section 8.2.

**Examples of Methods that Require Communication and Documentation** - The following
noise and vibration analysis methods and data require communication with the FTA Regional office and
documentation:

 - Non-standard transit noise and vibration modeling and analysis methods not described in this
manual (including non-standard adjustments, computations, and assumptions). This includes
modifications to standard FTA noise and vibration methods.

 - Non-standard transit noise and vibration reference data not described in this manual (including
measured data, substitution data, data at non-standard reference distances and/or speeds, new
transit noise sources, and transit noise sources operating in non-standard conditions).

 - Non-standard transit noise and vibration impact criteria not described in this manual, including
the maximum sound pressure level metric.

 - Non-standard methods of evaluating construction noise, including non-standard construction
noise impact criteria.

 - Other noise modeling tools besides the FTA Noise Impact Assessment Spreadsheet or Traffic
Noise Model (TNM®) for highway noise modeling, such as the development of a finite element
method model.

 - Any transit noise and vibration analysis that involves an impact area or noise source that is
controversial.

**Documentation Guidelines** - The use of non-standard noise and vibration analysis methods or data
requires the following documentation components in a technical memorandum attached to the
environmental document:

 - **Background**
Briefly describe the transit project for which non-default methods or data are needed. State the
dominant noise sources, type of analysis, and the impact criteria. Include any additional relevant
information.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION 237

- **Statement of Benefit**

Briefly describe the benefit of the non-default noise and vibration methods or data to the transit
project. Describe the appropriateness of the non-default methods or data, as well as why the
standard method or data are insufficient or problematic.

- **Non-standard Data Description**
Describe the non-standard noise or vibration data in detail. Include source type, manufacturer,
reference conditions (speed, distance, and operational conditions), name of data supplier, and a
date associated with data development/measurement. For measured noise or vibration data,
provide corresponding data documentation (such as a data measurement or a development
report). For substitution data, a comparison between the non-standard data and corresponding
standard data should be provided. Furthermore, if outside sources recommend the use of the
non-standard data (such as a technical society, a standards organization, or a vehicle
manufacturer), references for those recommendations should be included.

- **Non-standard Methods Description**
Describe the non-standard noise or vibration analysis method in detail. This should include a
detailed description and derivation of the method (including data used in the development of the
method), a description of the usage of the method, and a comparison between the non-standard
method and the corresponding standard method in the context of the transit analysis. If the
method has been validated against measurement data, a description of that validation analysis
should be provided. If the method is derived from another source (such as a different
transportation noise or vibration method), provide corresponding documentation for that
source. A description of how the method is conservative (for example, estimating the worstcase scenario) or some discussion on the probability of exceeding the predicted level should be
provided. Furthermore, if outside sources recommend the use of the non-standard method
(such as a technical society or standards organization), references for those recommendations
should be included.

- **Non-standard Tools Description**
Describe in detail any non-standard noise or vibration models that have not been explicitly
recommended in this manual. This should include a detailed description of the tool (including
data used, the computations implemented in the tool, any modifications or adjustments to the
tool or the corresponding data, and the usage of the tool), a description of the validation of the
tool (including reference documentation and validation analyses), and a comparison between the
non-standard tool and the equivalent standard tool in the context of the transit analysis.
Quantitative comparisons, such as the standard deviation of the non-standard tool and an
estimate of the least mean square of differences between the standard and non-standard tools,
should be provided and explained. A description of how the method is conservative (for
example, estimating the worst-case scenario) or some discussion on the probability of exceeding
the predicted level should be provided. If outside sources recommend the use of the non­
standard tool (such as a technical society or standards organization), references for those
recommendations should be included.

**814.41** Protección del equilibrio ecológico

**Capítulo 3:** **Instalaciones fijas nuevas y modificadas**

**Art. 7** Limitación de las emisiones de nuevas instalaciones fijas

1. Las emisiones de ruido de una nueva instalación fija serán limitadas de acuerdo a las disposiciones de la autoridad:
a. En la medida en que esto sea posible, al nivel técnico y de la explotación y a lo económicamente soportable, y
b. De manera que las _immissions_ de ruido debidas exclusivamente a la instalación en causa no sobrepasen los
valores de planificación.

2. La autoridad aprueba rebajas en la medida en que el respeto de los valores de planificación constituirá una carga
desproporcionada para la instalación y que esta última presenta un interés público preponderante. Los valores límites
de _immissions_ no deben ser sobrepasados.

**Art. 8** Limitación de las emisiones de instalaciones fijas modificadas

1. Cuando una instalación fija ya existente en el momento de la entrada en vigor del presente reglamento es
modificada, las emisiones de ruido de los elementos de instalación nuevos o modificados deberán, conforme a las
disposiciones de la autoridad, límitarse en la medida que esto sea posible, al nivel técnico y de la explotación y a
lo económicamente soportable.

_2._ Cuando la instalación ha sido notablemente modificada, las emisiones de ruido del conjunto de la instalación
deberán al menos limitarse para no sobrepasar los valores límites de _immission._

3. Las transformaciones, ampliaciones y modificaciones de explotación provocadas por el propietario de la
instalación, son consideradas como modificaciones notables de una instalación fija cuando se puede esperar que
la instalación misma o la utilización aumentada de las vías de comunicación existentes acarreará la percepción de
_immissions_ de ruidos más elevados. La reconstrucción de instalaciones es considerada en todos los casos como

modificación notable.

4. Cuando se modifica una instalación fija existente construida después de la entrada en vigor del presente reglamento,
el artículo 7 es aplicable.

**Art. 9** Mayor utilización de las vías de comunicación

La explotación de las instalaciones fijas nuevas o notablemente modificadas no debe provocar:

a. Un sobre pasamiento de los valores límites de _immission_ consecutivo a la mayor utilización de una vía de
comunicación o

b. La percepción de _immissions_ de ruido más elevados debido a la mayor utilización de una vía de
comunicación que necesita un saneamiento.

**Art. 10** Aislamiento acústico de los edificios existentes

1. Cuando, para las instalaciones fijas nuevas o notablemente modificadas, públicas o concesionarias, no es posible
respetar las exigencias requeridas en los artículos 7, 2 [do] apartado, y 8, 2 [do] apartado, o en el artículo 9, la autoridad
obliga a los propietarios de los edificios existentes expuestos al ruido a insonorizar, en el sentido del anexo 1, las
ventanas de los locales sensibles al ruido.

2. Los propietarios de los edificios pueden, con el consentimiento de la autoridad, aplicar a sus edificios otras
medidas de aislamiento acústico, si estas últimas reducen el ruido al interior de los locales en la misma
proporción.

**814.41** Protección contra el ruido

3. No deben tomarse medidas de aislamiento acústico cuando:

a. Se puede presumir que no producirán una reducción perceptible del ruido en el edificio;
b. Los intereses preponderantes de protección de sitios o monumentos históricos se oponen;
c. Cuando posiblemente el edificio será demolido dentro de los tres años que siguen a la puesta en servicio de la
instalación nueva o modificada o que, en este plazo, los locales involucrados sean destinados a un uso
insensible al ruido.

**Art. 11** Costo

1. El propietario de la instalación nueva o notablemente modificada, asume los gastos de la limitación de emisiones
que provoca su instalación.

2. Cuando el propietario de un edificio debe tomar medidas de aislamiento acústico en el sentido del artículo 10, 1 [er]

apartado, el propietario de la instalación se hace cargo, además de los gastos usuales locales, debidamente
justificados para:

a. La elaboración del proyecto y la dirección de los trabajos;
b. La insonorización necesaria de las ventanas en el sentido del anexo 1 y los trabajos de adaptación
indispensables que resulten.
c. El financiamiento si, a pesar de la demanda anticipada de gastos hecha por el propietario del edificio, el
propietario de la instalación no ha abonado ningún adelanto.
d. Eventuales impuestos.
3. Si el propietario del edificio debe tomar medidas de aislamiento acústico en el sentido del artículo 10, 2 [do]

apartado, el propietario de la instalación asume los gastos usuales locales, debidamente justificados, en tanto que
no excedan los del 2 [do] apartado. Los otros gastos están a cargo del propietario del edificio.

4. Cuando se toman medidas de limitación de emisiones o medidas de aislamiento acústico en razón del ruido

producido por varias instalaciones, los gastos que resulten serán repartidos proporcionalmente a las _immissiones_
del ruido de cada una de las instalaciones concernidas.

5. Los gastos de mantención y de renovación de las medidas de aislamiento acústico están a cargo del propietario del
edificio.

**Art. 12** Controles

La autoridad verificará, a más tardar, un año después de la puesta en servicio de la instalación nueva o modificada,
que las limitaciones de emisiones y las medidas de aislamiento acústico ordenadas fueron correctamente tomadas. En
caso de duda, examina la eficacia de las medidas.

**Capítulo 4:** **Instalaciones fijas existentes**

**Sección 1:** **Saneamiento y medidas de aislamiento acústico**

**Art. 13** Saneamiento

1. Para las instalaciones fijas que contribuyen de manera notable al aumento de los valores de _immission,_ la
autoridad ordena el saneamiento necesario, después de escuchar al propietario de la instalación.

2. Las instalaciones serán saneadas:

a. En la medida que esto sea posible a nivel técnico y de la explotación y económicamente soportable, y
b. De manera que los valores limites de _immission_ no sean sobrepasados.

Suiza1.EIA 5/32

**814.41** Protección del equilibrio ecológico

3. Si ningún interés preponderante se opone, la autoridad da prioridad a las medidas que impiden o reducen la
formación de ruido antes que a las que impiden o reducen únicamente su propagación.

4. El saneamiento no debe realizarse si:

a. El aumento de los valores límites de _immission_ afecta únicamente las zonas en construcción que no han sido
aún equipadas;
b. Sobre la base del derecho cantonal en materia de construcción y de acondicionamiento del territorio, las
medidas de planificación, de acondicionamiento o de construcción se toman en el lugar de las _immissions_ de
ruido, que permiten respetar los valores límites de _immission_ hasta el término de los plazos fijados.

**Art. 14** Rebajas en caso de saneamiento

La autoridad concede rebajas en la medida que:

a. El saneamiento obstaculizara de manera excesiva la explotación o acarreara gastos desproporcionados;
b. Intereses preponderantes, especialmente en los campos de la protección de sitios, de la naturaleza y del
paisaje, de la seguridad de la circulación y de la explotación, así como de defensa general, se oponen al
saneamiento.

2. Los valores de alarma no deben, sin embargo, ser sobrepasados por instalaciones privadas, no concesionarias.

**Art. 15** Aislamiento acústico de los edificios existentes

1. Si para instalaciones fijas, públicas o concesionarias, no es posible respetar los valores de alarma en razón de las
rebajas concedidas, la autoridad obliga a los propietarios de los edificios existentes expuestos al ruido, a
insonorizar, en el sentido del anexo 1, las ventanas de los locales sensibles al ruido.

2. Los propietarios de los edificios pueden, con el consentimiento de la autoridad, aplicar en sus edificios otras
medidas de aislamiento acústico, si estas últimas reducen el ruido al interior de los locales en la misma
proporción.

3. Las medidas de aislamiento acústico no deben tomarse cuando:

a. Se puede presumir que no ocasionarán una reducción perceptible del ruido en el edificio;
b. Los intereses preponderantes de la protección de sitios o monumentos históricos se oponen;
c. El edificio será probablemente demolido dentro los tres años que siguen a la orden de tomar medidas
de aislamiento acústico o que, en este plazo, los locales involucrados sean destinados a un uso insensible al
ruido.

**Art. 16** Costo

1. El propietario de la instalación asume además los costos de saneamiento de su instalación.

2. El propietario de una instalación pública o concesionaria asume además, según el artículo 11, los gastos de las
medidas de aislamiento acústico aplicadas a edificios existentes, cuando no le ha sido posible, en el sentido del
artículo 20, 2 [do] apartado,de la ley, liberarse de esta obligación.

3. Cuando se debe proceder a un saneamiento o tomar medidas de aislamiento acústico en razón al ruido producido
por varias instalaciones, los gastos que resulten serán repartidos proporcionalmente a las _immissiones_ de ruido de
cada una de las instalaciones concernidas.

**Art. 29** Delimitación de nuevas zonas de construcción y de nuevas zonas que necesitan
una mayor protección contra el ruido
1. Las nuevas zonas de construcción destinadas a edificios que incluyen locales sensibles al ruido, y las nuevas
zonas no construibles que requieren una mayor protección contra el ruido, pueden ser delimitadas sólo en sectores
donde las _immissions_ de ruido no sobrepasan los valores de planificación o en sectores en los cuales las medidas
de planificación, acondicionamiento o de construcción permitan respetar estos valores.

2. Las zonas son consideradas como nuevas cuando son delimitadas, después de la entrada en vigor del presente
reglamento, fuera de las zonas de construcción existentes.

**Art. 30** Equipamiento de las zonas de construcción

Las zonas de construcción destinadas a edificios que incluyen locales sensibles al ruido, que no han sido aún
equipadas al momento de la entrada en vigor del presente reglamento, podrán ser equipados sólo en la medida en que
los valores de planificación sean respetados o puedan serlo por un cambio de destinación o por medidas de
planificación, acondicionamiento o de construcción. La autoridad puede conceder excepciones a pequeñas partes de
las zonas de construcción.

**Art. 31** Permiso de construir en los sectores expuestos al ruido

1. Cuando los valores límites de _immission_ son sobrepasados, las nuevas construcciones o modificaciones notables de
edificios que incluyen locales sensibles al ruido, serán autorizadas sólo si estos valores pueden ser respetados por:
a. Medidas de construcción o acondicionamiento susceptibles de proteger el edificio contra el ruido o
b. La disposición de los locales sensibles al ruido sobre el lado del edificio opuesto al ruido.
2. Si las medidas fijadas en el 1 [er] apartado no permiten respetar los valores límites de _immission_, el permiso de
construir se entregará sólo con el asentimiento de la autoridad cantonal y en tanto que la edificación del edificio sea de
un interés preponderante.
3. El costo de las medidas está a cargo de los propietarios del terreno.

**Capítulo 6:** **Aislamiento acústico de los nuevos edificios**

**Art. 32** Exigencias
1. El maestro de obra de un nuevo edificio debe asegurarse que el aislamiento acústico de los elementos exteriores y
los elementos de separación de los locales sensibles al ruido, así como las escaleras y los equipamientos,
satisfacerán las reglas reconocidas en construcción. Son especialmente aplicables las exigencias mínimas según la
norma SIA 181 de la Asociación suiza de ingenieros y arquitectos.

2. Cuando los valores límites de _immission_ se han sobrepasado y las condiciones fijadas en el artículo 31, 2 [do]

apartado, para la atribución del permiso de construir se han cumplido, la autoridad refuerza en una medida
apropiada las exigencias impuestas en materia de insonorización de los elementos exteriores.

3. Las exigencias se refieren igualmente a los elementos exteriores, a los elementos de separación, a las escaleras y
al equipamiento que son transformados, reemplazados o renovados. A pedido, la autoridad concede rebajas
cuando el respeto de las exigencias es desproporcionado.

**Art. 33** Elementos exteriores y elementos de separación, equipamientos del edificio

1. Los elementos exteriores delimitan un local hacia afuera del edificio (por ej. ventanas, puertas y murallas
exteriores, techos).

**814.41** Protección contra el ruido

2. Los elementos de separación delimitan entre ellos los locales de diferentes unidades de asignación, tales como
departamentos (p. ej. paredes interiores, techos, puertas).

3. Los equipamientos son las instalaciones que hacen cuerpo con el edificio, tales como calefacción, ventilación,
instalaciones para la alimentación y la evacuación, ascensores o máquinas lavadoras.

puede requerir informaciones sobre el aislamiento acústico de los elementos exteriores.

**Art. 35** Controles

Después del término de los trabajos, la autoridad controla, por anotaciones, si las medidas de aislamiento acústico
satisfacen las exigencias. En caso de duda, procede a un examen más profundo.

**Capítulo 7:** **Determinación y evaluación de las** _**immissions**_ **de ruido exterior**
**de las instalaciones fijas**

**Sección 1: Determinación**

**Art. 36** Determinación obligatoria

1. La autoridad determina las _immissions_ de ruido exterior de las instalaciones fijas u ordena su determinación si
presume que los valores límites de exposición relativas se han sobrepasado o que podrían llegar a serlo.

2. Se tomará en cuenta la evolución futura de las _immissions_ de ruido que se pueden prevenir gracias a las
instalaciones nuevas o modificadas o al saneamiento de las instalaciones existentes, en la medida en que los
proyectos involucrados estén en encuesta pública al momento de la determinación.

**Art. 37** Catastros de ruido

1. La autoridad consigna las _immissions_ determinadas en el sentido del artículo 36 en los catastros de ruido,
separadamente para los caminos, las instalaciones ferroviarias y los aeródromos existentes.

**814.41** Protección del equilibrio ecológico

3. La autoridad transmite los catastros al Instituto federal del medio ambiente, de los bosques y del paisaje, a más
tardar dentro de los cinco años que siguen a la entrada en vigor del presente reglamento. Se preocupa de que sean
actualizados y corregidos periódicamente y de mandarlos, debidamente completados, al Instituto federal.

4. Si la ejecución de este artículo depende de una autoridad general (art. 46), esta última puede requerir a los
cantones los documentos necesarios para la elaboración del catastro.

El Instituto federal del medio ambiente, de los bosques y del paisaje pone el catastro a disposición de los cantones
concernientes.

5. El catastro de ruido puede ser consultado por cada uno, en tanto que el secreto de fabricación y de negocios esté
asegurado y que ningún otro interés preponderante se oponga.

**Art. 38** Métodos de determinación

1. Las _immissions_ de ruido se determinan según el nivel de evaluación Lr (anexo 3 a 7, cap. 3) o Lmax (anexo 5,
cap. 4) sobre la base de cálculos o de medidas.

2. Las exigencias en materia de modelos de cálculos y de instrumentos de medida se conformarán al anexo 2.

**Art. 39** Lugar de determinación

1. Para los edificios, las _immissions_ de ruido se medirán al medio de la ventana abierta de los locales sensibles al
ruido. Las _immissions_ de ruido de los aviones pueden tambien ser determinadas en la proximidad de los edificios.

2. En el sector no construido de las zonas que requieren una mayor protección contra el ruido, las _immissions_ de
ruidos se determinarán a 1,5 m. del suelo.

3. En las zonas a construir aún no construidas, las _immissions_ de ruido se determinarán allá donde, en conformidad al
derecho sobre el acondicionamiento del territorio y de las construcciones, podrán levantarse edificios que incluyan
locales sensibles al ruido.

**814.41** Protección contra el ruido

**Sección 2:** **Evaluación**

**Art. 40** Valores límites de exposición

1. La autoridad evalúa las _immissions_ de ruido exterior producidas por las instalaciones fijas sobre la base de los
valores límites de exposición según los anexos 3 y siguientes.

2. Los valores límites de exposición pueden también sobrepasarse cuando la suma de _immissions_ de ruido del mismo
tipo, proveniente de varias instalaciones, les es superior. Este principio no es válido para los valores de
planificación de las nuevas instalaciones fijas (art. 7, 1 [er] ap.).

3. Si los valores límites de exposición fallara, la autoridad evalúa las _immissions_ de ruido en el sentido del artículo 15
de la ley. Toma en cuenta igualmente los artículos 19 y 23 de la ley.

**Art. 41** Validez de los valores límites de exposición

1. Los valores límites de exposición son válidos para los edificios que incluyen locales sensibles al ruido.

2. Son igualmente válidos:

a. En las zonas a construir aún no construidas donde, en conformidad con el derecho de
acondicionamiento del territorio y de las construcciones, podrán levantarse edificios que incluyan
locales sensibles al ruido.

b. En el sector no construido de las zonas que requieren una mayor protección contra el ruido.

3. Para los sectores y edificios en los cuales las personas se quedan generalmente sólo de día o de noche, ningún
valor límite de exposición se aplicará por la noche o el día respectivamente.

**Art. 42** Valores límites de exposición específica a los locales de explotación.

1. Para los locales de explotación (art. 2,6 [to] ap.,let. b) situados en sectores donde se han atribuido grados de
sensibilidad I, II o III, los valores de planificación y los valores límites de _immission_ son de 5 dB (A) más
elevados.

2. El 1 [er] apartado no es aplicable a locales dentro de las escuelas, los establecimientos y los hogares. Para los locales
de restaurantes y hoteles, se aplican sólo en la medida en que estos locales estén suficientemente aereados, incluso
cuando las ventanas están cerradas.

**Art. 43** Grado de sensibilidad

1. En las zonas de destinación según los artículos 14 y siguientes de la ley federal sobre el acondicionamiento del
territorio [1)] **,** los grados de sensibilidad siguientes se aplicarán:

a. El grado de sensibilidad I en las zonas que requieren una mayor protección contra el ruido, especialmente en
las zonas de descanso;

b. El grado de sensibilidad II en las zonas donde ninguna empresa perjudicial es autorizada, especialmente en
las zonas de habitación así como en aquellas reservadas a las construcciones e instalaciones públicas.

Suiza1.EIA 13/32

**814.41** Protección del equilibrio ecológico

c. El grado de sensibilidad III en las zonas donde se admiten empresas medianamente perjudiciales,
especialmente en las zonas de habitación y artesanales (zonas mixtas) así como en las zonas agrícolas.
d. El grado de sensibilidad IV en las zonas donde se admiten empresas extremadamente perjudiciales,
especialmente en las zonas industriales.

2. Se puede disminuir de un grado las partes de las zonas de destinación del grado de sensibilidad I o II, cuando ellas
ya han sido expuestas al ruido.

**Art. 44** Procedimiento

1. Los cantones se preocupan de que los grados de sensibilidad se atribuyan a las zonas de destinación en los
reglamentos de construcción o los planes a destinación comunales.

2. Los grados de sensibilidad se atribuirán al momento de la delimitación o de la modificación de las zonas de
destinación o al momento de la modificación de los reglamentos de construcción, pero a más tardar dentro de los
10 años que siguen a la entrada en vigor del presente reglamento.

3. Antes de la atribución, los grados de sensibilidad se determinarán caso por caso por los cantones en el sentido del
artículo 43.

**3.** **Determinación del nivel de evaluación**

**3.1.** **Principios**

1. El nivel de evaluación Lr para el ruido del tráfico vial se calcula a partir de niveles de evaluación parciales del ruido
de los vehículos a motor (Lr1) y del ruido de los ferrocarriles (Lr2).
Lr = 10 **.** log (10 [0,1 ] **[.]** [ Lr1] +10 [0,1] **[ .]** [ Lr2] )
2. El nivel de evaluación parcial Lr1 es la suma del nivel medio Leq,m, ponderado A, generado por los vehículos a
motor, y de la corrección del nivel K1:
Lr1 = Leq,m + K1
3. El nivel de evaluación parcial Lr2 es la suma del nivel medio Leq,b, ponderado A, generado por los ferrocarriles, y
de la corrección del nivel K2:

Lr2 = Leq,b + K2
4. Los niveles de evaluación parciales Lr1 y Lr2 se determinan para el tráfico medio de día y de noche a partir de una
calzada supuestamente seca.

**3.2.** **Tráfico medio de día y de noche**

1. El tráfico medio de día y de noche es la media anual del tráfico horario entre las 6 y las 22 horas y entre las 22 y las
6 horas.

2. El tráfico horario de día (Nt) o de noche (Nn) de los vehículos a motor comprende dos volúmenes de tráfico
parciales que son Nt1y Nt2 o Nn1 y Nn2.
3. Los volúmenes de tráfico parciales Nt1 y Nn1 de los vehículos a motores comprenden los vehículos de turismo, los
vehículos de reparto, los minibuses, los ciclomotores y los trolebuses.
4. Los volúmenes de tráfico parciales Nt2 y Nn2 de los vehículos a motores comprenden los camiones, los semiremolques, los buses y autobuses, los motociclos y los tractores.
5. El tráfico ferrocarriles comprende todos los trenes que circulan regularmente o según las necesidades,
comprendiendo los desplazamientos de servicio.

**3.3.** **Determinación del tráfico medio de día y de noche de los vehículos a motor**

Suiza1.EIA 19/32

**814.41** Protección del equilibrio ecológico

1. El tráfico medio de día o de noche (Nt, Nn) así como los volúmenes de tráfico parciales (Nt1, Nt2, Nn1, Nn2) se
determinan como sigue:
a. Para los caminos existentes, por contabilización de los vehículos;
b. Para los caminos que se construirán o modificarán, sobre la base de previsiones del tráfico.
2. Si los datos obtenidos por la contabilización de los vehículos son insuficientes o no se dispone de previsiones
detalladas, los volúmenes de tráfico Nt, Nn, Nt1, Nt2, Nn1y Nn2 se calculan sobre la base del tráfico diario medio
(TJM; vehículos en 24 horas):
Nt = 0,058 **.** TJM Nn = 0,009 **.** TJM
Nt1 = 0,90 **.** Nt Nn1 = 0,95 **.** Nn
Nt2 = 0,10 **.** Nt Nn2 = 0, 05 **.** Nn
3. El TJM se determina en función de reglas reconocidas en materia técnica y de planificación del tráfico.

**3.4.** **Determinación del tráfico medio de día y de noche de los trenes**

El tráfico mediano de día y de noche de los trenes se determina como sigue:
a. Para las instalaciones ferroviarias existentes, a partir del horario y de los datos del tráfico;
b. Para las instalaciones ferroviarias que se construirán o modificarán, sobre la base de previsiones del tráfico.

**3.5.** **Correcciones de nivel**

1. La corrección de nivel K1 para el ruido de los vehículos a motor se calcula a partir del trafico medio de día y de
noche como sigue:
K1 = -5 para N < 31,6
K1 = 10 **.** log (N/100) para 31,6 < N < 100
K1 = 0 para N > 100
**N** representa el tráfico horario de los vehículos a motor Nt o Nn.

2. La corrección del nivel K2 para el ruido de los ferrocarriles es igual a -5. Para los chirridos frecuentes y claramente
percibidos, la corrección de nivel es igual a 0.

**3.** **Determinación del nivel de evaluación**

**3.1.** **Principios**

1. El nivel de evaluación Lr para el ruido de los ferrocarriles se calcula a partir de los niveles de evaluación parciales
del ruido de la circulación de trenes (Lr1) y del ruido de las maniobras (Lr2):
Lr = 10 **.** log (10 [0,1 . Lr1] +10 [0,1 . Lr2] )
2. El nivel de evaluación parcial Lr1 es la suma del nivel mediano Leq,f, ponderado A, generado por la circulación de
trenes, y de la corrección del nivel K1:
Lr1 = Leq,f + K1
3. El nivel de evaluación parcial Lr2 es la suma del nivel medio Leq,r, ponderado A, generado por las maniobras, y de
la corrección del nivel K2:

Lr2 = Leq,r + K2
4. Los niveles de evaluación parciales Lr1 y Lr2 están determinados para la explotación media de día y de noche.

**3.2.** **Explotación media de día y de noche**

1. La explotación media de día y de noche es la media anual de la circulación respectivamente de los trenes y de las
maniobras entre las 6 y las 22 horas y entre las 22 y las 6 horas.
2. La circulación de trenes comprende todos los trenes que circulan regularmente o según las necesidades,
comprendidos los desplazamientos de servicios.
3. Las maniobras comprenden todos los movimientos de material ferroviario y las operaciones de explotación que
sirven a la dislocación o a la formación de trenes.

4. La circulación de los trenes y las maniobras se determinan como sigue:
a. Para las instalaciones ferroviarias existentes, a partir del horario y de los datos de explotación;

Suiza1.EIA 21/32

**814.41** Protección del equilibrio ecológico

b. Para las instalaciones ferroviarias que se construirán o modificarán, sobre la base de previsiones de la
explotación.

**3.3.** **Correcciones de nivel**

1. La corrección del nivel K1 para el ruido de la circulación de los trenes está calculada como sigue:
K1 = -15 para N < 7,9
K1 = 10 **.** log(N/250) para 7,9 < N < 79
K1 = -5 para N > 79
**N** representa el número de trenes que circulan de día o de noche.
2. La corrección del nivel K2 para el ruido de las maniobras toma en consideración la frecuencia y la audibilidad de
todas las manifestaciones sonoras a componentes impulsivos, tonales o que producen chirridos:

1. El nivel de evaluación Lr para el ruido de los aeropuertos regionales y de los campos de aviación es la suma del
nivel Leq, ponderado A, y de la corrección del nivel K:
Lr = Leq + K
2. El nivel medio Leq está determinado para el número medio de movimientos horarios (número de movimientos **n** ) de
un día con tráfico pic medio.
3. Por movimiento, se entiende cada aterrizaje y cada despegue de una aeronave a motor. Los procedimientos
aterrizaje-despegue inmediato cuentan por dos movimientos.

Suiza1.EIA 23/32

**814.41** Protección del equilibrio ecológico

**3.2.** **Número de movimientos “n” para los aeropuertos regionales y los campos** **de** **aviación**
**existentes**

Para establecer el número de movimientos “n” en los aeropuertos regionales y los campos de aviación existentes, se
aplica el método siguiente:
a. Determinar los seis meses en que el tráfico es más intenso en el curso de un año de explotación;
b. Durante estos seis meses, determinar el número mediano de movimientos de vuelos para cada uno de los siete
días de la semana; las medias diarias de dos días de tráfico más intenso en las indicadas N1y N2;
c. Calcular “n” a partir de N1 y N2 efectuando la media sobre las doce horas del día:
n = (N1 + N2)/24

**3.3.** **Número de movimientos “n” para los aeropuertos regionales y los campos** **de** **aviación**

**nuevos**

1. Para los aeropuertos regionales y los campos de aviación que se construirán o modificarán, el número de
movimientos “n” está determinado sobre la base de previsiones del tráfico.
2. Cuando no es posible establecer previsiones detalladas, “n” será calculada a partir del número anual de
movimientos previsibles N como sigue:
n = (N **.** 2,4) / (365 **.** 12)

**3.4.** **Corrección de nivel**

La corrección del nivel K está calculada a partir del número de movimientos N como sigue:
K = 0 para N < 15 000
K = 10 . log(N/15 000) para N > 15 000

**4.** **Determinación del nivel de ruido máximo medio Lmax para las heliestaciones**

1. Para las heliestaciones, el nivel de ruido máximo medio Lmax es la media energética del nivel de ruido máximo, de
un número representativo de sobre-vuelos o de pasadas.
2. Para determinar Lmax, las medidas se harán con los aparatos regulados sobre SLOW o con un grabador de nivel,
cuya velocidad de escritura es de 16 mm/s.

_Significado:_
Dw el número anual de medios días de tiro durante la semana sobre una media de tres años;
Ds el número anual de medios días de tiro durante los domingos sobre una media de tres años;

2. Cada actividad de tiro, en la mañana o en la tarde, de una duración superior a dos horas, cuenta por un medio día de
tiro. Si su duración es inferior a dos horas, cuenta por la mitad de un medio día de tiro.
3. Para determinar los medios días de tiro y el número de disparos, se tomarán en cuenta todos los tiros que se
desarrollan regularmente sobre un período de tres años. Los tiros militares irregulares y extraordinarios no son
tomados en consideración.

4. Para las instalaciones nuevas o modificadas, los medios días de tiro y el número de los disparos se determinarán
sobre la base de previsiones de explotación.

**3** **Determinación del nivel de evaluación**

**3.1** **Principios**

1. El nivel de evaluación Lr del ruido de los aeródromos militares se calcula a partir de los niveles de evaluación del
ruido de los aviones militares, Lr m, y del ruido de los aviones civiles, Lr z, como sigue:
Lr = 10 - log (10 [0,1] [• Lr] [ m] + 10 [ 0,1 • Lr] [ z] )

2. El nivel de evaluación Lr z se calcula como el nivel evaluación Lr del ruido de los aeropuertos regionales y de los
campos de aviación según la cifra 3 del anexo 5.
3. El nivel de evaluación Lr m se calcula a partir de los niveles de evaluación parciales del ruido de los aviones a
reacción, Lr j, y del ruido de aviones a hélices, Lr p, como sigue:
Lr m = 10 - log (10 [0,1] [• Lr] [ J] + 10 [ 0,1 • Lr] [ P] )
4. El nivel de evaluación parcial Lr j es la suma del nivel medio Leq j, ponderado A, generado por el movimiento de los
aviones a reacción, y de las correcciones de nivel K 0 y K 1 .
Lr j = Leq j + K 0 + K 1
5. El nivel de evaluación parcial Lr p es la suma de nivel medio Leq p, ponderado A, generado por el movimiento de
aviones a hélices, y de las correcciones de nivel K 0 y K 2 .
Lr p = Leq p + K 0 + K 2
6. Los niveles medianos Leq j y Leq p son determinados por el número medio de movimientos horarios de los aviones a
reacción y a hélices (número de movimientos n j y n p ) un día de tráfico mediano.
7. Por movimiento, se entiende cada despegue y cada aterrizaje de aviones a reacción y a hélices. Los procedimientos
de reposición de los gases valen por dos movimientos.

**3.2** **Número de movimientos n** **j** **y n** **p** **para los aeródromos militares**

1. Para establecer el número de movimientos n j y n p en los aeródromos militares existentes, se aplica el siguiente
metodo:

a. Se determinan, separadamente para los aviones a reacción y a hélices, los seis meses donde el tráfico
es el más intenso a lo largo de un año de explotación;
e. Se determinan, durante esos seis meses, el número de movimientos de aviones a reacción M j y de aviones
a hélices M p ;
c. Se calcula el número de movimientos n j y n p a partir de M j y M p sacando la media sobre 130 días y sobre
doce horas del día:

n j = M j /(12 . 130)
n p = M p /(12 . 130)
2. Para los aeródromos militares nuevos o transformados, los números de movimientos n j y n p son determinados sobre
la base de las previsiones del tráfico.

**814.41** Protección contra el ruido

**3.3** **Correcciones de nivel**

1. La corrección de nivel K 0 es igual a -8.
2. La corrección de nivel K 1 está calculada a partir del número anual de movimientos de aviones a reacción N j como
sigue:
K 1 = 0 para N j < 15 000
K 1 = 10 - log (N j /15 000) para N j - 15 000
3. La corrección de nivel K 2 está calculada a partir del número anual de los movimientos de los aviones a hélices N p,
como sigue:
K 2 = 0 para N p < 15 000
K 2 = 10 - log (N p /15000)para N p - 15 000
