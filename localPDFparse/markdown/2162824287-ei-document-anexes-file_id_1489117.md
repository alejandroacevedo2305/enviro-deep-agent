### TM
# TrinaTracker Vanguard -1P
## Single-Row

**Compatible with Latest**
**Modules**

Compatible with N/P -Type modules up to
690W .

**Higher Reliability**

Optimized torque tube improves the torsional
resistance by 29.6% and the bending
resistance by 12.4%

**Higher Stability**

The behavior of the tracker against the wind is
improved by 20%

**SuperTrack Smart Tracking**
**Algorithm**

Compared with conventional tracking algorithm, increase
energy generation by as much as 8% .

**BILATERAL** **SPHERICAL**
**DAMPER SYSTEM** **BEARING**

The bilateral damper system can
shorten the tracker oscillation

time,thus preventing oscillation.
Dynamic responses are reduced
and the critical wind speed
increased

Global patented spherical bearings with up to 30%
angle adjustability,alleviate the damage caused by
uneven foundation settlement during operations.
The spherical bearings dissipate the extra stress
caused by the deformation of the tracker
system,thus reduce the load and failure rate of each
component.
