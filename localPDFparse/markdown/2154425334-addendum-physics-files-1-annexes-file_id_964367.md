# Johnson Offshore Intake Systems (JOISTM)

### Johnson Offshore Intake SystemsTM (JOISTM) provide uninterrupted water withdrawal from lakes, rivers and oceans.

With 50 years of intake screen
experience and thousands of
­installations covering a variety of
conditions, application engineers
from Aqseptence Group can
­provide design and application

assistance.

From shallow rivers to deep

oceans from coastal to offshore

installations JOISTM can meet site

requirements anywhere in the
world. JOISTM comprises two parts:
one or more original Johnson
Screens [®] passive intake screen(s)
and the corresponding HydroburstTM air-powered cleaning unit.

#### Advantages

EPA Rule 316b-compliant and
also compliant with UK fish
protection laws

- Easy and quick to install

- Low head loss

- Proven technology for shallow

water resources

- No waste stream - there is no

debris brought to the surface to
be handled or disposed of

- Compact design

- Submerged and offshore

- MaxFlowTM Intake design -

­enabling up to 40 % higher flow

To provide maximum efficiency,
Johnson Screens [®] passive intake
screens are designed and engineered to each unique environment, resulting in a system which
costs less to install, operate and
requires less maintenance.
­Johnson Screens [®] high capacity
passive intake screens are constructed using non-plugging VeeWire [®] with an internal dual flow

modifier that creates a nearly uniform low flow velocity through the
entire screen surface. This significantly reduces impingement and
entrainment of debris while

protect­ing aquatic life. ­Passive
screens are designed to meet

- Low capital costs and no

­moving parts, and low mainte
nance needs

- Easy cleaning - with a periodic
blast of compressed air using
our HydroburstTM system

- Non-plugging Vee-Wire [®]

- Three standard configurations
- drum, tee and half screens

­regulatory requirements for a
maximum slot velocity for both
entrainment and impingement.
This velocity is typically 0.15 m/s
which is the maximum velocity at
which a juvenile fish can turn
around, swim away and not be
impinged onto a passive screen
but the screens can be designed
to the velocity requirements of the
application. This, combined with a
wide range of slot sizes (typically
between 2 - 10 mm) determines
our screen sizing. Furthermore, the
large open area and low velocities
result in a very low head loss in
all applications, providing low
overall operating costs.

- Internal dual-flow modifierprovides low and even slot
velocity (CFD modelling is
available on demand)

- Selection of materials - from

304 stainless steel for fresh

­water to Super Duplex for seawater; Z-alloy (CuNi) for repelling zebra mussel attachment
and anti-bio fouling in fresh

water

Johnson Screens [®]

Half Intake Screen

In early development, Johnson
looked at modifier designs, which
included restrictive pipes using
slots and holes, they were rejected
due to potential plugging and a
very high pressure drop across the
screen surface area was experi
enced.

The Johnson Screens [®] passive intake screen systems have an open
pipe design that is highly effective, and is based on the industry
standard. The key component of
a Johnson [®] intake screen system

Johnson Screens’ next generation

Passive Intakes with the Max
FlowTM design increase the flow
capacity of the previous designs
by up to 40 %. The newly redesign­
ed internal modifier allows an even

slot velocity distribution also along
the extended screening surface in

the screen central area. The new

As water demands increase for

cities, towns and industry, shallow
water resources previously hard to

withdraw from due to their lack of

depth, have become a more viable
option.

is the internal dual flow modifier.

The even flow raises the overall

efficiency of the screen to over 90
percent, which means more compact screen cylinders than with a
single pipe modifier.

The low pressure drop across the
screen surface and through the
screen body (lower head loss)
­reduces the amount of energy
required to pull water through
the screen, creating significant
­savings on operating costs.

significant capital savings in any
intake project by using more compact or fewer intake screens. Additionally, project savings can be
increased by reducing piping and
civil works. Naturally, the new
screen design also offers all of the
same features and benefits that

standard passive screens do and
still promises the same fish-friendly performance as the previous
designs of Johnson Screens [®] Pas
sive Intake screens have been

doing for over 40 years. Johnson
Screens [®] Max-FlowTM Passive In
take is a patent pending design.

Our patented half screen has all
the same attributes (low slot

­velocity, HydroburstTM option,
Vee-­Wire [®], dual flow modifier,

etc.) as the standard passive
­intake screens but can operate in
a much lower depth of water. Our
standard ­passive screens require
approximately half a diameter

clearance around the screen. The

half screen sits flat on the bottom

and only needs the top clearance.

With time, general debris might
gather on the outer screen surface.
Aqseptence Group GmbH has
therefore developed the HydroburstTM backwash system to ensure
a reliable submerged intake system, the so called JOISTM (Johnson
Offshore Intake Systems). The
­HydroburstTM cleans the passive
intake screens efficiently from
debris without having to send
­divers in to clean the screens, but

by regularly releasing an appropriate volume of compressed air
through the bottom of the screen
within a few seconds time. The air

displaces the water inside the
screen which is consequently
pressed through the screen openings in opposite flow direction,

­followed by the compressed air.
By means of its buoyancy the air

distributes the debris into the water

and so keeps the screen functioning continuously and properly.

Our HydroburstTM system is design­
ed to deliver a sufficient volume

of air, customized to the site and

installation conditions - a real solid

blast of air that has proven to work
in a wide variety of types of applications and conditions. By using a
programmable timer system and
automated PLC system that is able

to communicate to a central data

control system/SCADA system for
control, it is possible to clean the
screens in automatic and/or man
ual mode.
