**INTRODUCTION**

_**About the Trophy Cam HD**_

The Bushnell **Trophy Cam HD** is a digital scouting camera. It can be
triggered by any movement of game in a location, detected by a highly
sensitive Passive Infra-Red (PIR) motion sensor, and then take high quality
pictures (up to 8MP still photos), or video clips.

The **Trophy Cam HD** consumes very little power (less than 0.25 mA) in
a stand-by (surveillance) state. This means it can deliver up to six months
stand-by operation time when the device is powered by the full capacity of
AA alkaline batteries, and up to twelve months utilizing lithium AA batteries.
Once motion in the monitored area is detected, the digital camera unit will be
triggered at once (typically within one second) and then automatically take
photos or videos according to previously programmed settings. The **Trophy**
**Cam HD** is equipped with built-in infrared LEDs that function as a flash, so
that it delivers clear photos or videos (in black & white) even in the dark, and
it can take color photos or videos under sufficient daylight. The **Trophy Cam**
**HD HD** is designed for outdoor use and is resistant against water and snow.

Your trail camera is one of the latest generation of Bushnell **Trophy Cam HD**
**HDs**, and includes many new or improved features, including:

 - Auto PIR Sensitivity-the camera monitors ambient temperature
conditions and automatically adjusts the sensor/trigger signal to be
more sensitive to slight variations in temperature on hot days, less
sensitive on cold days.

 - Hyper NightVision-The IR LED Flash array now has increased range,
brighter output and better coverage for improved nighttime images.

 - Field Scan 2x with Live Trigger-This “time lapse” feature includes the
option for a second block of recording with its own start/stop times.
Trigger signals generated by nearby wildlife activity will still generate
additional photos/videos as they normally would, independently of the
Field Scan operation.

 - GPS Geotag Capability-allows the user to input the longitude and
latitude of the camera’s position, which will be embedded in each
photo file. This enables Google Earth, Picassa and other geotag
enabled software to automatically show a map pinpointing each
camera’s location when a group of photos are reviewed on a computer.

**4**

Especially useful for those who setup multiple **Trophy Cam HDs** to
monitor large or widely separated areas.

 - Multi Flash Mode (LED Control)- prevents overexposed flash photos in
close range applications

 - Hybrid Capture Mode-allows both still photos and videos to be
captured at each trigger, up to highest resolution settings for each.

 - NV Shutter-user can select shutter speed for images captured at night
allowing control over brightness vs. ability to stop motion

 - Camera Operating Mode can be limited to Day only, Night only, or 24
HRs

And many more features such as HD Video with Audio, widescreen or
fullscreen format still photos, imprintable camera name (user set) along with
current data including temperature, moon phase and barometric pressure*
_(*imprinted barometer data only available on model 119678C)_ .

_**Applications**_

The **Trophy Cam HD** can be used as a trail camera for hunting or scouting
game. It is also suitable for surveillance usage.

**PARTS AND CONTROLS**

The **Trophy Cam HD** provides the following connections for external
devices: USB port, SD card slot and external DC power in ( _**pg 6, Fig. 1)**_ .

A 3-way power switch is used to select the main operating modes: **OFF,**
**SETUP**, and **ON** ( _**pg 6, Fig. 2)**_ .

A control key interface with six keys is primarily used in SETUP mode to
select operational functions and parameters. As shown on the next page,
these keys are: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, OK and MENU. Three of the keys
can also perform a second function (shortcut operations in **SETUP** mode) in
addition to their main function: The DOWN key can be used to set the camera
to Photo mode (still camera icon), and the UP key can set the camera to
Video mode (movie camera icon). The RIGHT key also serves as the manual
shutter (“SHOT”) button of the camera. These secondary functions are
indicated by icons or text above the key as shown below.

**INSTALLING THE BATTERIES AND SD CARD**

Before you begin learning how to use your **Trophy Cam HD**, you will first
need to install a set of batteries and insert an SD card. Although that may
only take you a minute, there are some important notes about both batteries
and SD cards you should be aware of, so please take the time to read the
following directions and cautions:

_**Loading Batteries**_

After opening the two latches on the right side of the
Trophy Cam HD, you will see that the **Trophy Cam**
**HD** has eight or twelve battery slots, depending on
your model. For maximum battery life, you should install
a full set of batteries. The **Trophy Cam HD** may also
be operated by just four batteries installed in the first
slots only ( _starting on the top or left-see photos_ ).
Battery life will be shorter with 4 batteries, but the
camera will operate normally. Whether you use 4 or
a full set, be sure to insert each battery with correct
polarity (negative or “flat” end against the long spring
of each battery slot).

Bushnell recommends using a full set of new lithium
AA (Energizer [®] brand) or alkaline AA batteries. NiMh
Rechargeable batteries are not recommended, as the
lower voltage they produce can cause operational
issues.

Optionally, you can connect the #119656C Accessory Solar Panel _(please_
_visit_ _www.bushnell.com for more information)_ to the “DC In” jack at the
bottom of the **Trophy Cam HD** _(other external power supplies should not_
_be used, as the camera and/or display may not function correctly)_ . If the
solar panel is connected and AA batteries are installed, the **Trophy Cam HD**
will be powered by the solar panel's rechargeable lith-ion battery, as long as
it provides adequate voltage (if not, the camera will switch to battery power).
The solar panel's battery will power the camera at night.

When the batteries become weak _(or a device with insufficient power is_
_connected to DC In)_, the low-battery indicator LED will glow blue, indicating
the batteries should be changed ( _**pg 6, Front View**_ ).

**7**

_**Inserting the SD Card**_

The **Trophy Cam HD** has 32MB of internal memory, which can hold only
about 20 photos (@ 5MP resolution). This is handy for testing and getting
familiar with the camera, but you will no doubt want to leave the camera
unattended for longer than a day, so using an SD card is recommended for
all models. Insert the SD card (with the camera’s power switch in the **OFF**
position) before beginning to operate the camera. Don’t insert or remove the
SD card when the power switch is in the **ON** position.

The **Trophy Cam HD** uses a standard SD (Secure Digital) memory card to
save photos (in .jpg format) and/or videos (in .avi format). SD and SDHC
(High Capacity) cards up to a maximum 32GB capacity are supported.
Using high speed SD cards (SanDisk [®] Ultra [®] or Extreme [®] series or similar)
is recommended if you will use the 1280x720 or 1920x1080 video settings.
Before inserting the SD card into the card slot after opening the camera’s
front cover, please make sure that the write-protect switch on the side of the
card is “off” (NOT in the “Lock” position). The following describes how to
insert and remove the SD card:

 - Insert the SD card into the card slot with its label side upwards (see
_**below**_ ). A “click” sound indicates that the card is installed successfully.
If the wrong side of the card is facing up, you will not be able to insert
it without force-there is only one correct way to insert cards. If the SD
card is not installed correctly, the device will not display an SD card icon
on the LCD in SETUP mode ( _the SD card icon displayed after switching_
_to SETUP mode will have a “lock” symbol inside it in it if the card is locked_ ).
Formatting the SD card by using the **Trophy Cam HD’s** “Format”
parameter before using it for the first time is recommended, especially
when a card has been used in other devices _(see pg. 22, “Format” for_
_details)._

 - To take out the SD card, just gently push in the card (do not try to pull it
out without pushing in first). The card is released from the slot and ready
to be removed when you hear the click. _WARNING: Be sure the camera’s power is switched_
_OFF before inserting or removing SD cards or batteries._

**USING THE Trophy Cam HD**

Once you’ve prepared your **Trophy Cam HD** by properly installing batteries
and an SD card, you could simply take it outside, strap it to a tree, switch it
on and leave-and you might get some great photos that are exactly what you
wanted. However, we highly recommend that you first spend some additional
time indoors with this manual and your camera until you know a bit more
about what the 3-way switch and those control keys do. If nothing else, you’ll
probably want to at least set the date and time so the camera will imprint
them (or not-it’s your option) on your photos as they are taken, learn how to
set the camera to shoot video clips instead of still photos if you like, and read
some tips about mounting it on a tree.

**THE OFF, ON, AND SETUP MODES**

The **Trophy Cam HD** has three basic operational modes:

 - **OFF** mode: Power switch in the **OFF** position.

 - **ON** mode: Power switch in the **ON** position (LCD screen is off.)

 - **SETUP** mode: Power switch at **SETUP** position (LCD screen is on).

**OFF Mode**

The **OFF** mode is the “safe” mode when any actions must be taken, e.g.,
replacing the SD card or batteries, or transporting the device. You will also
use **OFF** mode if you connect the camera to a computer’s USB port later
to download your photos/videos. And of course, when you are storing or
not using the camera, you will switch it to **OFF** . Please note that even in
the **OFF** mode the **Trophy Cam HD** still consumes power at a very low
level. Therefore, it’s a good idea to take the batteries out of the battery
compartment if the camera will not be used for a long time.

**ON Mode**

Anytime after the batteries and SD card have been inserted, you can switch
on the camera. When the power switch is moved to the top position, the
camera will enter into the **ON** (Live) mode. The motion indicator LED
( _pg. 7, “Front View”_ ) will blink red for about 10 seconds. This interval allows
time for you to close the **Trophy Cam HD’s** front cover, lock it, and leave
the monitored area. Once in the **ON** mode, no manual controls are needed
or possible (the control keys have no effect). The **Trophy Cam HD** will take
photos or videos automatically (according to its current parameter settings)

**9**

when it is triggered by the PIR sensor’s detection of activity in the area it

covers.

You can either move the power switch directly from OFF to ON mode, or
stop at the SETUP position first to change one or more settings, then move
the switch to ON after you have finished doing so.

**SETUP Mode**

In the **SETUP** mode you can check and change the settings of the **Trophy**
**Cam HD** with the help of its built-in LCD. These settings, found in the SETUP
Menu, let you change the photo or video resolution, interval between photos,
switch the time imprint on, etc. Moving the power switch to the **SETUP**
position will turn on the LCD display, and you will see an information screen
that shows how many images have been taken, the battery level, camera or
video mode, etc ( _**Fig. 3**_, next page).

NOTE: Always move the power switch from **OFF** to **SETUP** mode. It
is possible that the camera could lockup if it is switched from **ON** to
**SETUP** mode. If this occurs, simply move the switch to **OFF** and then
push it up to **SETUP** again.

_**SETUP Mode Shortcut Keys/Functions**_

As mentioned earlier in “Parts & Controls”, four of the keys below the LCD
have secondary, “shortcut” functions when the camera is switched to
**SETUP** mode (but the **MENU** key has not been pressed):

 - Press the **UP** key to quickly set the camera to shoot video clips.

 - Press the **DOWN** key to quickly set the camera to take still photos.

 - Press the **RIGHT** key to manually trigger the shutter. This is useful
for testing the camera-make sure you are in **SETUP** mode, press the
**RIGHT** key, and a few seconds later a photo or video (depending on
how the camera was set) will be saved to the SD card (or internal
memory if no card is inserted). The “number of images taken” counter
on the bottom left of the LCD will increase by one. If the display
indicates “SD PROTECTED” when you press the SHOT key, switch
the camera OFF, remove the SD card and slide its protect switch off.

**Using the SETUP Menu to Change Settings**

The main purpose of the **SETUP** mode is to allow you to change the settings
of the camera’s parameters (19 different ones are available!) so your **Trophy**
**Cam HD** operates exactly the way you want it to. You will do this by entering
the **SETUP** Menu and pressing the keys below the LCD display, which will
show you each parameter and its setting.

_**Changing Parameter Settings in SETUP Mode**_
A wide range of options or “parameters” are provided to allow you to set the
**Trophy Cam HD** to your operational preferences. To change the setting of
any parameter you must first switch to the **SETUP** mode. Once in **SETUP**
mode, pressing the **MENU** button will allow you to select any parameter and
change its setting. The name of the parameter and its current setting will be
shown on the LCD. Pressing the **RIGHT** or **LEFT** key scrolls to the next or
previous parameter ( **RIGHT** key to move on to the next parameter and **LEFT**
key to go back to the previous parameter), and pressing the **UP** or **DOWN**
key lets you select a different setting for the currently displayed parameter.
Once you have selected your preferred new setting for a parameter, press
the **OK** button to save the new setting (actually change it). When you are
finished changing the settings of one or more parameters, press **MENU**
again to exit the **SETUP** menu. **MENU** can also be pressed anytime you
want to cancel changing a parameter’s setting after a new setting has been
selected (but OK has not been pressed yet). After setting the parameters
to your preferences, be sure to move the switch to **ON** to begin actually
taking photos or videos. No images will be captured if the switch is left in the
**SETUP** position _(unless you press the_ **RIGHT** _/Shot key after exiting the menu)_ in fact, the camera will power off automatically after a few minutes with no
key pressed.

_**Parameter Settings Display**_
The settings for each parameter are shown on the display screen of your
**Trophy Cam HD** . Only one setting is displayed at a time, starting with the
current setting for the parameter when it is first selected ( _**pg. 13,**_ _**Fig. 4a**_ ).
To change the setting, use the UP/DOWN keys to display the new setting
you want ( _**Fig. 4b**_ ), then press OK to “Execute” (make the actual change to
this setting). If you want to confirm this setting is now the current one, just
press the **RIGHT** key to scroll to the next parameter, then press **LEFT** to go
back again to the previous one. You should see the parameter setting you
just made.

_**EXAMPLES-Changing the Settings of Some Common**_
_**Parameters**_

Following this page, you will find tables listing all of the parameters found in
the **SETUP** Menu, along with their possible settings (or range of settings),
and a detailed description of what the parameter controls and what
the settings do. If you read the previous section detailing how to select
parameters and change their settings, you should be able to dive right in, find
the parameter(s) you want, and setup the camera to suit your preferences.
But maybe you’d rather walk through an example or two first:

To change any parameter’s setting, always start with the power switch in the
**SETUP** position. After the LCD comes on, press the **MENU** key.

The first parameter you will see when you first enter the **SETUP** Menu is
“Mode”. To change it from its default setting of “Camera” (still photos) to
“Video” (shoot video clips), press the **DOWN** key to select the “Video”
setting. Press the **OK** key to “Execute” (Set) the new setting you’ve selected
for this parameter.

Now press the RIGHT key to move to another parameter in the Menu.
Pressing it three times will take you to “Capture Number”. Try using the **UP**
and **DOWN** keys to scroll through the range of settings, then press **OK** to
lock in your setting for the number of photos the camera takes each time it's
triggered.

Pressing the **RIGHT** key until you reach the last menu item, you'll see the
“Default Set” parameter. Highlight or select “Execute” (using **UP** or **DOWN** )
and press **OK** to restore all parameters (including the Mode and Video
Length parameters you changed a minute ago) back to their original factory
default settings. The default settings for each parameter are indicated in bold
type in the **SETUP** Menu tables on the next several pages.

Be sure to set the current date and time, using the “Set Clock” parameter, if you
choose to change the “Time Stamp” parameter setting to “On” since that will tell
the camera to imprint the date and time on each of the images it captures.

_**Field Scan 2x with Live Trigger Feature**_

Field Scan is a revolutionary new feature for the Bushnell **Trophy Cam HD**,
which allows you to monitor your food plots or field edges with time lapse
images or video. When set to “On”, the **Trophy Cam HD** will take a photo
(or record a video clip) automatically at your choice of intervals (for example,
once every five minutes) during one or two blocks of time you set up for each
day, **without requiring a trigger from an active animal** . This has the
advantage of giving you the ability to monitor the edge of a field that might
be 50 or 150 yards away from the camera out of the PIR sensor’s range. The
result is an effective range much greater than it would normally be, with the
camera dependant on triggers generated by nearby animals. This is a great
tool for hunters to scout an entire field with only one camera.

If an animal does enter the area covered by the PIR sensor and generate a
trigger event during a time in between the Field Scan intervals you set, the
camera will capture an image or video just as it normally would, based on
your other menu settings. Here’s how to setup and use Field Scan (be sure
you’ve set the current time in “Set Clock” first, so your Field Scan recording
will stop and start at the correct times of day):

1. Move the main switch to **SETUP**, then press **MENU** .

2. Keep pressing the **RIGHT** key, stepping through the Setup Menu until
you reach Field Scan.

3. Press the **UP** key to select On, and press **OK** _(Step 1, pg.17)_ . You will
see "A", representing the first block of time you can define (a second
block of time later in the day, "B" can also be setup if you wish). Press
**OK** _(Step 2)_ . This takes you to the screen to set Start and Stop times,
which determines the clock times when the first block of Field Scan
recording will begin and end for each day. You can set these times to
the exact hour and minute you want, for a recording “window” that
lasts anywhere from just a minute to a full 24 hours.

4. Set the [Start] and [Stop] times, beginning with the Start hour, using
the **UP/DOWN** keys to change the setting _(Step 3)_ . The hour setting
is based on a 24-hour clock, with “00” hours = midnight, “12” hours
= noon, “23” hrs = 11PM, etc. To move to the next setting, press the
**RIGHT** key, change the minute for the Start time with **UP/DOWN**,
then on to the hour and minute settings for the Stop time.

**15**

5. After you finish setting the Stop minutes, press **OK** to confirm your
settings for the first block of Field Scan recording. If desired, you can
create a second block of time by pressing the **DOWN** key to select "B"
_(Step 4)_, then press **OK** and follow the same process to set Start and
Stop times for Field Scan block "B" _(Step 5)_ . As an example of how you
might use these two available time blocks, you could setup Field Scan
time block "A" for the dawn hours from 6 AM to 8 AM, and block "B"
to capture images between 5:30 and 7 PM. No Field Scan recording
would occur from 8AM to 5:30PM, or from 7PM to 6AM.

6. After setting Start/Stop times to define Field Scan block "A" and/or
"B", press **OK**, then press the **UP** or **DOWN** key to select "Interval"
and press **OK** _(Step 6)_ . The Field Scan "Interval" setting lets you
control how often a photo or video clip is recorded during the block(s)
of time you defined with the Start and Stop settings. Your options are
60 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 5 minutes (this is the default), or
1 minute (still photo mode only). Use the **UP/DOWN** keys to select
your preference, then press OK to save it _(Step 7)._ Note that for videos,
"Interval" is independent of the Length of each video recording-it’s
**how often** videos are recorded, not how long each one lasts.

7. Here’s an example of how the camera would operate, based on the
following Field Scan settings:

**Field Scan:** On

**Field Scan A:**

**[Start]:** 6:00

**[Stop]:** 8:00

**Field Scan B:**

**[Start]:** 17:30

**[Stop]:** 19:00

**Interval:** 15M

Note: avoid any "overlap" of Field Scan A & B
recording blocks when setting their start and stop
times, to assure correct operation. Also-if the "Camera
Mode" menu parameter is set to "Day" or "Night"
operation only, that will take priority over your Field
Scan settings. Set the Camera Model to "24 HR" if
you are setting both day and night start and/or stop
times in Field Scan.

These settings would cause the camera to capture a photo (or video,
if the camera is set to that mode) once every 15 minutes, beginning at
6 AM, until the Field Scan "A" recording block stops at 8:00 AM. Later
that day, the camera would again take a photo or video every 15 minutes
between 5:30 PM and 7:00 PM (during Field Scan time block "B").
The next day, the camera would again record an image or video once
every 15 minutes between 6:00 and 8:00 AM, and between 5:30 and

**16**

7:00 PM. No Field Scan recording would occur from 8AM to 5:30PM,
or from 7PM to 6AM. Remember, Field Scan recording is independent
of normal triggers due to animal activity-even if no animals enter the IR
sensor coverage zone, an image or video will still be captured every 15
minutes during the block(s) of time. If an animal triggers the camera “in
between” the 15 minute intervals, it will be recorded.
Note: Field Scan settings of frequent intervals and/or long periods
between start and stop time can reduce battery life.

**USING THE SETUP MENU INPUT SCREENS**

_**Camera Name Input**_

After selecting the Camera Name parameter (the only setting is "Input"),
press **OK** . If necessary, delete the previous or default name by pressing the
**RIGHT** key until the backspace symbol ( ) (located between letters "A"
& "B", also between "j" & "k") is highlighted, then keep pressing **OK** . Select
(highlight) each alphanumeric character you want, using the **LEFT/RIGHT**
keys, and pressing **OK** after each one to set it. When finished naming the
camera, press **MENU** to save the name to memory.

_**Coordinate Input**_

After selecting the Coordinate Input parameter, press **UP** or **DOWN** to
select the On setting and press **OK** . The latitude and longitude for any
location where you plan to place the camera can be obtained at many
websites, for example: http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html. You can enter
a nearby street address, just zip code, or use the various types of maps to
locate the approximate position. The format you will need to use to enter the

**MOUNTING and POSITIONING the TROPHY**

**CAM HD**

_**Mounting**_

After you’ve set up the camera’s parameters to your personal preferences
at home or in your truck, you’re ready to take it outside and slide the power
switch to “ **ON** ”. When setting up the **Trophy Cam HD** for scouting game or
other outdoor applications, you must be sure to mount it in place correctly
and securely. We recommend mounting the **Trophy Cam HD** on a sturdy
tree with a diameter of about 6 in. (15cm). To get the optimal picture quality,
the tree should be about 16-17 ft. (5 meters) away from the place to be
monitored, with the camera placed at a height of 5-6.5 ft. (1.5~2 m). Also,
keep in mind that you will get the best results at night when the subject is
within the ideal flash range, no farther than 60’ (19m) and no closer than 10’
(3m) from the camera.

There are two ways to mount the **Trophy Cam HD** : using the provided
adjustable web belt, or the tripod socket.

Using the adjustable web belt: _**Fig. 5**_ illustrates using the web belt on
the **Trophy Cam HD** . Push one end of the belt through the two brackets
on the back of the **Trophy Cam HD** . Thread one plastic buckle part onto
each end of the belt. Fasten the belt securely around the tree trunk by
clicking the buckle ends together after tightening the belt so there is no
slack left.

Using the tripod socket: The camera is equipped with a socket at the
bottom end to enable mounting on a tripod or other mounting accessories
with a standard1/4-20 thread.

_**Fig. 5**_ : Attaching the Belt

Strap Buckle

**26**

Another socket, on the back of the camera, is also provided for accessory
mounting devices. Two optional mounting accessories, a “Bear Safe”
metal camera box _(#119657C for 119676C/119677C, #119658C for_
_119678C)_ and Deluxe Tree Bracket _(# 119652C fits all 3 camera models)_
are also available-please see your Bushnell dealer or website for more details.

_Note: an accessory solar panel (#119656C) supplemental power source is_
_also available - please visit www.bushnell.com for more information._

_**Sensing Angle and Distance Test**_

To test whether the **Trophy Cam HD** can effectively monitor the area you
choose, this test is recommended to check the sensing angle and monitoring
distance of the **Trophy Cam HD** . To perform the test:

 - Switch the **Trophy Cam HD** to the **SETUP** mode.

 - Make movements in front of the camera at several positions within
the area where you expect the game or subjects to be. Try different
distances and angles from the camera.

 - If the motion indicator LED light blinks, it indicates that position can be
sensed. If it does not blink, that position is outside of the sensing area.
The results of your testing will help you find the best placement when
mounting and aiming the **Trophy Cam HD** . The height away from the ground
for placing the device should vary with the animal size appropriately. In
general, 3 to 6 feet is preferred.

You can avoid potential false triggers due to temperature and motion
disturbances in front of the camera by not aiming it at a heat source or nearby
tree branches or brush (especially on windy days).

_**Switching ON the Camera**_

Once you switch to the **ON** mode, the motion indicator LED (red) will blink for
about 10 seconds. This gives you time to close and lock the front cover of the
**Trophy Cam HD** and then walk away. During this time, the motion indicator
LED will blink red continuously. After it stops blinking, the PIR is active, and
any motion that is detected by it will trigger the capture of photos or videos
as programmed in the **SETUP** Menu. Be sure you have read the descriptions
of the Capture Number, Video Length, Interval and Sensor Level parameters.
Please note, the PIR is strongly sensitive to ambient temperature. The greater
the temperature difference between the environment and your subject, the

**27**

farther the possible sensing distance. The average sensing distance is about
45 ft.

_Before leaving the camera unattended, please check for the following:_

 - Are the batteries or DC power supply inserted/connected with correct
polarity and is the power level is sufficient?

 - Does the SD card have sufficient available space and is its writeprotection (lock) switch off?

 - Is the Power switch in the **ON** position? (do not leave it in **SETUP** ).

_**About the ARD (Anti Reflective Device)**_

A removable filter grid (ARD) covers the LED flash, so that light reflections
from the protective black glass panel over the LED array are greatly reduced.
This helps to prevent detection of the camera by animals (and potential
thieves). If getting maximum light output from the LED flash is a higher priority
than concealment, the ARD grid may be easily removed by inserting a small
screwdriver, key, etc. in the slot at the lower center of the ARD (above the
camera lens), and gently pulling it up away from the camera _(see pg. 6)_ .

**REVIEWING/DELETING THE PHOTOS/VIDEOS**

After you have setup, mounted and activated your **Trophy Cam HD,** you will
of course be eager to return later and review the images it has captured for
you. There are several different ways this can be done.

_**Reviewing Images Directly From the SD Card**_

This is the most popular method of viewing images. Since unmounting the
camera and taking it to your computer isn’t very convenient, you may find it
easier to just take the card out. By removing the SD card (swapping it for a
new empty card if you like) and taking it to your home or campsite to view
the images by using an SD card “reader” _(user supplied)_ connected to your
computer (some computers and TVs have a built in SD card slot), you can
leave the camera in place ready to capture more images. Once connected,
the card reader works the same way as described below-please read that
section if you have any problem finding your files.

**28**

_**Reviewing Images by Connecting the Camera to a Computer**_

You can always unmount the entire camera from the tree and connect its
USB port to a computer-it will be recognized as a “removable disk”, without
the need to install any drivers or software. When using a PC (or Mac*) to view
photos (or video clips*), first connect the device to the computer with the
supplied USB cable. Then use commercial software with an image browser
feature, or an image browser included with the PC’s operating system to
view images saved on the SD card in the folder \DCIM\100EK113 _(a new_
_folder will be created every 1000 images)_ . Each new image or video will be
numbered incrementally in order of the time it was captured. For example, you
will see file names such as “EK0001.JPG” or “EK0001.AVI”, etc. Through the
file format suffix you can distinguish whether the file is a still photo (with suffix
.JPG) or a video (with suffix .AVI).
_*video files may require additional software for viewing on a Mac._

The **Trophy Cam HD** supports 3 kinds of file system formats, FAT12, FAT16,
and FAT32. The default value is FAT16 to save photos and videos. Here are
some related notes:

 - You don’t need to be concerned about the file system format of the
**Trophy Cam HD** unless your equipment has problems reading the SD
card. If this happens, please format the SD card with the **Trophy Cam**
**HD** or in your computer first and then insert the card into your **Trophy**
**Cam HD** and try again.

 - The default file system format of the **Trophy Cam HD** is FAT16, which
most computers can read. If you format an SD card for the **Trophy**
**Cam HD** in your computer, you should choose the file system format
FAT16. Normally FAT16 is recommended unless you have another
image viewer that uses FAT12 or FAT32 format.

_**Deleting Photos or Videos**_

To delete all photos from the installed SD card, use the Format parameter
_(see pg. 22 for details)_ .

**29**

**DOWNLOADING THE PHOTOS/VIDEOS**

To download your photos/videos to a PC or Mac*, first make sure the **Trophy**
**Cam HD** power switch is in the **OFF** position. Connect the supplied cable to
the camera’s USB port, then directly to a main USB port on your computerdo not use front panel/keyboard USB ports or unpowered “hubs”.

The **Trophy Cam HD** will be recognized as a standard “USB Mass Storage”
device (this may take several seconds the first time you connect it). If you
would rather leave your camera in the woods and just pull its SD card out, an
SD card reader works the same way as described in this section once the
card is inserted and the reader is connected to your computer.

With Windows XP or later*, you can then simply use the options in the popup window to copy, view, or print your photos ( _**right**_ ).

On all Windows OS, the **Trophy Cam HD** will also
be listed as a “Removable Disk” if you open the “My
Computer” window (on Macs, an icon will appear on
your desktop). The **Trophy Cam HD** ’s photo files are
named “EK0001.JPG” etc, and are located in the
“DCIM\100EK113” folder on this “Removable Disk”.
Video file names will end with “.AVI”. You may copy the
photos/videos to your hard drive as you would any filejust copy/paste or drag the file names or icons to your
drive or desktop.

After the photos are copied to your hard drive, you can disconnect the
**Trophy Cam HD** . (On Mac computers, drag the “disk” that appeared on
your desktop when the camera was connected into your Trash to “eject” it
before disconnecting.) The .JPG format photo files from the **Trophy Cam**
**HD** may be viewed and edited with any photo software you choose to use.
The .AVI video files may be viewed with the Windows Media Player on PCs
with Windows 7.

*If your computer is running an older version of Windows, or you are on a
Mac, and you don’t already have a compatible video player, you can download
a free version of the DivX player from http://www.divx.com/.

**TROUBLESHOOTING / FAQ**

**Camera takes continuous images of no subject**
A camera has what is known as a “false trigger” if the PIR sensor thinks
that there is motion and heat in front of the camera lens when there is

no subject in the image. These “False Triggers” are the result of placing
the camera in an environment where there is motion associated with tree

branches creating motion in front of the camera or an area where there
is high heat in the foreground and any motion from wind could set off the
camera. Setting a camera up over water is also a potential cause for this
issue. To remedy this situation:

1. Try moving the camera to an area that does not have any of these issues or try changing the sensor level on the menu settings.
2. If the camera continues to take images when there is no subject in
them, try placing the camera in an inside environment and aiming at a
location where there is no motion.

3. If the camera continues to show issues, then there is probably an
electronic component issue. If this is the case, please contact our
customer service to send the camera back for repair.

**Battery life is shorter than expected**

1. Battery life will vary with operating temperature and the number of
images taken over time. Typically, the **Trophy Cam HD** will be able to
capture several thousand images before the batteries die.
2. Check to make sure you have used new alkaline or lithium batteries.
Bushnell recommends using a full set of Energizer [®] Lithium
AA batteries in your Trophy Cam HD model to obtain maximum
battery life.
3. Make sure that the power switch was turned to the “On” position and
that the camera was not left in “Setup” mode while in the field.
4. Make sure that you are using a good quality name brand SD card in
your camera. Bushnell recommends SanDisk [®] brand SD Cards up
to 32GB _(Ultra_ _[®]_ _or Extreme_ _[®]_ _series for HD video)_ . Our experience
indicates that poor quality SD cards can sometimes reduce your
**Trophy Cam HD** battery life.

**Camera stops taking images or won’t take images**

1. Please make sure that the SD card is not full. If the card is full, the
camera will stop taking images.

**31**

2. Check the batteries to make sure that they are new alkaline or lithium
AA batteries. _**See note above about short battery life.**_
3. Make sure that the camera power switch is in the **“On** ” position and not
in the **“Off”** or **“Setup”** modes.
4. Make sure that you are using a good quality SD card in your camera.
Bushnell recommends SanDisk [®] SD Cards up to 32GB _(Ultra_ _[®]_ _or_
_Extreme_ _[®]_ _series for HD video)_ .
5. If the SD card has its write protect switch in the lock position, the
camera will not take images.
6. If you have used an SD card in another device before inserting it in your
**Trophy Cam HD**, you might want to try formatting the card using the
“Format” parameter in Setup mode (make sure you have backed up any
important files first, as formatting will erase all previous files). In some
cases, other devices may change the formatting of the SD card so that
it will not work properly with the **Trophy Cam HD** .

**Camera won’t power up**
1. Make sure that you have installed at least 4 batteries (the required
minimum #) in the battery compartment, starting at the top, filling
battery spaces 1-4 with no “gaps”.
Bushnell recommends using a full set of 8 or 12 Energizer [®]
Lithium AA batteries in your Trophy Cam HD (the max. capacity for
your model).
2. Make sure that the batteries are installed correctly, observing proper
polarity. Always place the negative (flat) end of each battery in contact
with the spring side of its slot inside the camera.
3. After moving the switch from **“Off”** to **“Setup”** or **“On”**, make sure
that the switch is correctly in position to ensure the proper mode (avoid
positions “between” two modes).
4. Do not move the switch directly from **“On”** to **“Setup”** -always move
the switch all the way down to **“Off”** first, then back up to **“Setup”** .

**Still Photo and/or Video Quality Problems**
_1. Night photos or videos appear too dark_

_a_ . Check the battery indicator icon to see if battery power is full. The
flash will stop operating near the end of the battery life.

_b._ You will get the best results when the subject is within the ideal
flash range, no farther than 60' (19m) . Subjects may appear too dark
at greater distances.

**32**

_c_ . Please note that when the Capture Number parameter is set higher
than "1 Photo", or with very short Interval settings, some images
may appear darker than others due to the quick response and rapid
retriggering of the camera, allowing less time for the flash to fully
recharge before firing again.

_d_ . Make sure "LED Control" in the setup menu is set to "High" to
ensure maximum output. You can also try setting "NV Shutter" in the
menu to "Low" (slower shutter speed=brighter images, with tradeoff
of increased blur if subject moves rapidly).
_e._ The ARD (anti-reflective device) shield can be removed to maximize
flash output. See _page 29_ for more details.
_2. Daytime photos or videos appear too dark_
Make sure that the camera is not aimed at the sun or other light sources
during the day, as this may cause the auto exposure to produce darker
results.

_3. Night photos or videos appear too bright_
If the subject is close to the camera (less than10ft/3m), change the
LED Control parameter in the Setup Menu to "Medium" or "Low".
_4. Daytime photos or videos appear too bright_

Make sure that the camera is not aimed at the sun or other light
sources during the day.
_5. Photos with streaked subject_

_a_ . In some cases with low lighting conditions and fast moving subjects,
the 5MP or 8MP resolution settings may not perform as well as the
3MP setting.

_b_ . If you have multiple images where fast moving subjects produce
streaks on the photo, try the 3MP setting instead.

_c_ . Set "NV Shutter" to "High" to minimize motion blur.
_6. Red, green or blue color cast_

_a_ . Under certain lighting conditions, the sensor can become confused
resulting in poor color images.

_b_ . If this is seen on a consistent basis, then the sensor may need
servicing. Please contact Bushnell customer service.
_7. Short video clips--not recording to the length set_

_a_ . Check to make sure that the SD card is not full.

**33**

_b_ . Make sure that the camera has good batteries in it. Near the end
of the battery life, the camera may choose to record shorter video clips

to conserve power.

**Date/Time Stamp not appearing on images**
Make sure that the **“Time Stamp”** parameter is set to **“On”** .

**Photos Do Not Capture Subject of Interest**
1. Check the “Sensor Level” (PIR sensitivity) parameter setting. For
warm temperature conditions, set the Sensor Level to “High” and for
cold weather use, set the sensor for “Low”. For variable weather, use
"Auto".

2. Try to set your camera up in an area where there is not a heat source in
the camera’s line of sight.
3. In some cases, setting the camera near water will make the camera take
images with no subject in them. Try aiming the camera over ground.
4. Try to avoid setting the camera up on small trees that are prone to being
moved by strong winds.
5. Remove any limbs which are right in front of the camera lens.

**PIR Sensor LED Flashes/Doesn’t Flash**
1. When the camera is in the “Setup” mode, a special LED on the front of
the camera will flash when it senses motion. This is for setup purposes
only and will help the user aim the camera.
2. During use, the LED will not flash when the camera takes an image.

This is to help keep the camera hidden from game.

**LCD Screen Issues**

_1. LCD screen powers on but no text is present._

_a_ . After moving the switch from “Off” to “Setup” or “On”, make sure
that the switch is correctly in position to ensure the proper mode (avoid
positions “between” two modes).

_b_ . Do not move the switch directly from “On” to “Setup”-always move
the switch all the way down to “Off” first, then back up to “Setup”.
_2. LCD screen shows a faint black line after turning from “Setup” to “On”._

The LCD will turn off when you slide the switch to the “On” position. In
some cases, this black line will appear and then fade in about 1
second. This is normal and the camera will function properly.

**34**

_3. Screen comes on but then powers off_

Make sure that you have installed the SD card correctly.

**Camera won’t retain settings**
Make sure that you have been saving the changes to any parameter
settings that you made while in Setup mode, by pressing **“OK”** after
changing the setting. If you don’t save your new setting after changing
it, the camera will continue to use the original default setting for that
parameter.

**Moisture or Ants Inside Camera**

1. To ensure humidity or rain is kept out of the camera, secure the DC In
plug firmly in place.

2. Ants can be attracted by low level electronic vibrations, and enter
through any gaps between the exterior and interior of the camera.
Make sure the DC In plug is securely attached.

**Field Scan (Time Lapse) not working properly**
1. Make sure that the stop and start times of Field Scan "A" and "B" do
not overlap (for example, do not set the start time of "B" to 8AM if the
stop time of "A" is 10AM).

2. When using Field Scan in video mode, the smallest interval time available is 5 min, to avoid potential overheating of the batteries and electronic components, which could cause operational failure or damage to
the camera. In still photo mode, a 1 min. Interval can be set.

Do not mix old and new batteries.

Do not mix battery types-use ALL lithium or ALL alkaline.
Rechargeable batteries are not recommended.

**INTRODUCTION**

_**About the Core Trail Camera**_

The Bushnell **Core Trail Camera** is a digital scouting camera. It can be triggered by any movement of
game in a location, detected by a highly sensitive Passive Infra-Red (PIR) motion sensor, and then take
high quality pictures (up to24MP or 30MP still photos), or video clips.

The **Core Trail Camera** consumes very little power (less than 0.08 mA) in a stand-by (surveillance) state.
This means it can deliver up to six months stand-by operation time when the device is powered by the
full capacity of AA alkaline batteries, and up to twelve months utilizing lithium AA batteries. Once
motion in the monitored area is detected, the digital camera unit will be triggered at once (typically
within half a second) and then automatically take photos or videos according to previously programmed
settings. The **Core Trail Camera** is equipped with built-in infrared LEDs that function as a flash, so that it
delivers clear photos or videos (in black & white) even in the dark, and it can take color photos or videos
under sufficient daylight. The **Core Trail Camera** is designed for outdoor use and is resistant against

water and snow.

Your trail camera is one of the latest generation of Bushnell **Core Trail Camera.**

**Core Trail Cameras**, and includes many new or improved features, including:

**• Dual Sensor (119975C/119977C only) -** the camera has dual sensors in order to capture the best
quality images for both day and night.

**• Auto PIR Sensitivity** - the camera monitors ambient temperature conditions and automatically adjusts
the sensor/trigger signal to be more sensitive to slight variations in temperature on hot days, less
sensitive on cold days.

**• Removable Battery Tray** - replaceable battery tray in order to easily exchange your batteries quickly.
Built in latch in order to catch the tray from falling out of the camera.

3

**• GPS Geotag Capability** - allows the user to input the longitude and latitude of the camera’s position,
which will be embedded in each photo file. This enables Google Earth, Picassa and other geotag enabled
software to automatically show a map pinpointing each camera’s location when a group of photos are
reviewed on a computer. Especially useful for those who setup multiple **Core Trail Camera s** to monitor
large or widely separated areas.

**• Hybrid Capture Mode** - allows both still photos and videos to be captured at each trigger, up to
highest resolution settings for each.

**• NV Shutter** - user can select shutter speed for images captured at night allowing control over
brightness vs. ability to stop motion.

**• Camera Operating Mode** can be limited to Day only, Night only, or 24 HRs

**• Dynamic Video** mode uses the duration of animal activity to determine the length of the captured file,
so your video doesn't stop right as things get interesting.
And many more features such as video with audio, 0.2 second trigger speed and 0.6 second recover time
(still photos), widescreen or fullscreen format still photos, imprintable camera name (user set) along
with current data including temperature and moon phase.

_**Applications**_
The **Core Trail Camera** can be used as a trail camera for hunting or scouting game. It is also suitable for
surveillance usage.

**PARTS AND CONTROLS**

The **Core Trail Camera** provides the following connections for external devices: USB port, SD card slot
and external DC power in ( _pg 6, Fig. 1)_ .

A 3-way power switch is used to select the main operating modes: **OFF, SETUP**, and **ON** ( _pg 6, Fig. 2)_ .
A D-Pad interface with five keys is primarily used in SETUP mode to select operational functions and
parameters. As shown on the next page, these keys are: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, OK and ENTER. Three
of the keys can also perform a second function (shortcut operations in **SETUP** mode) in addition to their
main function: The DOWN key can be used to set the camera to Photo mode (still camera icon), and the
UP key can set the camera to Video mode (movie camera icon). The RIGHT key also serves as the manual
shutter (“SHOT”) button of the camera. These secondary functions are indicated by icons or text above
the key as shown on the next page.

**INSTALLING THE BATTERIES AND SD CARD**

5

Before you begin learning how to use your **Core Trail Camera**, you will first need to install a set of
batteries and insert an SD card. Although that may only take you a minute, there are some important
notes about both batteries and SD cards you should be aware of, so please take the time to read the
following directions and cautions:

_**Loading Batteries**_
After opening the latch on the right side of the Core Trail Camera, you will see that the **Core Trail**
**Camera** has a battery release button. Depress this button and a battery tray will drop out of the
bottom of the camera. The battery tray will stop about 1⁄2 inch out of the device, this is a latch system to
prevent the tray from dropping onto the ground. Just apply a little pressure when pulling and the tray
will release. The battery tray has six battery slots. Install a full set of 6 batteries. Be sure to insert each
battery with correct polarity (negative or “flat” end against the long spring of each battery slot).

Bushnell recommends using a full set of new lithium AA (Energizer® brand) or alkaline AA batteries.
NiMh Rechargeable batteries are not recommended, as the lower voltage they produce can cause
operational issues.

_-_
You can also connect an optional Solar Panel accessory _(model# 119756C_ _please visit_
_www.bushnell.com for more information)_ to the “DC In” jack at the bottom of the **Core Trail Camera**
_(other external power supplies should not be used, as the camera and/or display may not function_
_correctly)_ . If the solar panel is connected and AA batteries are installed, the **Core Trail Camera** will be
powered by the solar panel's rechargeable lith-ion battery, as long as it provides adequate voltage (if
not, the camera will switch to battery power). The solar panel's battery will power the camera at night.

_**Inserting the SD Card**_
Insert the SD card (with the camera’s power switch in the **OFF** position) before beginning to operate the
camera. Don’t insert or remove the SD card when the power switch is in the **ON** position.

The **Core Trail Camera** uses a standard SD (Secure Digital) memory card to save photos (in .jpg format)
and/or videos (in .mp4 format). SD and SDHC (High Capacity) cards up to a maximum 32GB capacity are
supported. Using high speed SD cards (SanDisk® SDHC rated class 6 or higher) is recommended if you
will use the 1280x720 or 1920x1080 video settings. Before inserting the SD card into the card slot after
opening the camera’s front cover, please make sure that the write-protect switch on the side of the card
is “off” (NOT in the “Lock” position). The following describes how to insert and remove the SD card:

6

 - Insert the SD card into the card slot with its label side upwards (see _below_ ). A “click” sound
indicates that the card is installed successfully. If the wrong side of the card is facing up, you will
not be able to insert it without force-there is only one correct way to insert cards. If the SD card
is not installed correctly, the device will not display an SD card icon on the LCD in SETUP mode
( _the SD card icon displayed after switching to SETUP mode will have a “lock” symbol inside it in it_
_if the card is locked_ ). Formatting the SD card by using the **Core Trail Camera** “Format”
parameter before using it for the first time is recommended, especially when a card has been

used in other devices _._

 - To take out the SD card, just gently push in the card (do not try to pull it out without pushing in
first). The card is released from the slot and ready to be removed when you hear the click.
_WARNING: Be sure the camera’s power is switched OFF before inserting or removing SD cards or_

_batteries._

**USING THE Core Trail Camera**

Once you’ve prepared your **Core Trail Camera** by properly installing batteries and an SD card, you could
simply take it outside, strap it to a tree, switch it on and leave-and you might get some great photos that
are exactly what you wanted.

However, we highly recommend that you first spend some additional time indoors with this manual and
your camera until you know a bit more about what the 3-way switch and directional keys do. If nothing
else, you’ll probably want to at least set the date and time so the camera will imprint them (or not-it’s
your option) on your photos as they are taken, learn how to set the camera to shoot video clips instead
of still photos if you like, and read some tips about mounting it on a tree.

**THE OFF, ON, AND SETUP MODES**
The **Core Trail Camera** has three basic operational modes:

- **OFF** mode: Power switch in the **OFF** position.

- **ON** mode: Power switch in the **ON** position (LCD screen is off.)

- **SETUP** mode: Power switch at **SETUP** position (LCD screen is on).

7

**OFF MODE**

The **OFF** mode is the “safe” mode when any actions must be taken, e.g., replacing the SD card or
batteries, or transporting the device. You will also use **OFF** mode if you connect the camera to a
computer’s USB port later to download your photos/ videos. And of course, when you are storing or not
using the camera, you will switch it to **OFF** . Please note that even in the **OFF** mode the **Core Trail**
**Camera** still consumes power at a very low level. Therefore, it’s a good idea to take the batteries out of
the battery compartment if the camera will not be used for a long time.

**ON MODE**

Anytime after the batteries and SD card have been inserted, you can switch on the camera. When the
power switch is moved to the top position, the camera will enter into the **ON** (Live) mode. The motion
indicator LED ( _pg. 6, “Front View”_ ) will blink red for about 10 seconds. This interval allows time for you
to close the **Core Trail Camera’s** front cover, lock it, and leave the monitored area. Once in the **ON**
mode, no manual controls are needed or possible (the control keys have no effect). The **Core Trail**
**Camera** will take photos or videos automatically (according to its current parameter settings) when it is
triggered by the PIR sensor’s detection of activity in the area it covers.

You can either move the power switch directly from OFF to ON mode, or stop at the SETUP position first
to change one or more settings, then move the switch to ON after you have finished doing so.

**SETUP MODE**

In the **SETUP** mode you can check and change the settings of the **Core Trail Camera’s** with the help of its
built-in LCD. These settings, found in the SETUP Menu, let you change the photo or video resolution,
interval between photos, switch the time imprint on, etc. Moving the power switch to the **SETUP**
position will turn on the LCD display, and you will see an information screen that shows how many
images have been taken, the battery level, camera or video mode, etc _(Fig. 3, next page)_ .

NOTE: Always move the power switch from **OFF** to **SETUP** mode. It is possible that the camera could
lockup if it is switched from **ON** to **SETUP** mode. If this occurs, simply move the switch to **OFF** and then
push it up to **SETUP** again.

_**SETUP Mode Shortcut Keys/Functions**_
As mentioned earlier in “Parts & Controls”, four of the directional keys beside the LCD have secondary,
“shortcut” functions when the camera is switched to **SETUP** mode (but the **MENU** key has not been
pressed):

- Press the **UP** key to quickly set the camera to shoot video clips.

- Press the **DOWN** key to quickly set the camera to take still photos.

- Press the **RIGHT** key to manually trigger the shutter. This is useful for testing the camera-make sure
you are in **SETUP** mode, press the **RIGHT** key, and a few seconds later a photo or video (depending on
how the camera was set) will be saved to the SD card (or internal memory if no card is inserted). The
“number of images taken” counter on the bottom left of the LCD will increase by one. If the display
indicates “SD LOCKED” when you press the SHOT key, switch the camera OFF, remove the SD card and

slide its lock switch off.

**USING THE SETUP MENU TO CHANGE SETTINGS**

The main purpose of the **SETUP** mode is to allow you to change the settings of the camera’s parameters
( _available parameters vary with use of Presets-see pg. 18 for more details_ ) so your **Core Trail Camera**
operates exactly the way you want it to. You will do this by entering the **SETUP** Menu and pressing the
keys beside the LCD display, which will show you each parameter and its setting.

_**Changing Parameter Settings in SETUP Mode**_
A wide range of options or “parameters” are provided to allow you to set the **Core Trail Camera** to your
operational preferences. To change the setting of any parameter you must first switch to the **SETUP**
mode. Once in **SETUP** mode, pressing the **MENU** button will allow you to select any parameter and
change its setting. The name of the parameter and its current setting will be shown on the LCD.
Pressing the **RIGHT** or **LEFT** key scrolls to the next or previous parameter ( **RIGHT** key to move on to the
next parameter and **LEFT** key to go back to the previous parameter), and pressing the **UP** or **DOWN** key
lets you select a different setting for the currently displayed parameter. Once you have selected your
preferred new setting for a parameter, press the **ENTER** button to save the new setting (actually change
it). When you are finished changing the settings of one or more parameters, press **MENU** again to exit
the **SETUP** menu. **MENU** can also be pressed anytime you want to cancel changing a parameter’s setting
after a new setting has been selected (but OK has not been pressed yet). After setting the parameters to
your preferences, be sure to move the switch to **ON** to begin actually taking photos or videos. No images
will be captured if the switch is left in the **SETUP** position _(unless you press the_ **RIGHT** _/Shot key after_
_exiting the menu)_ -in fact, the camera will power off automatically after a few minutes with no key
pressed.

_**Parameter Settings Display**_
The settings for each parameter are shown on the display screen of your **Core Trail Camera** . Only one
setting is displayed at a time, starting with the current setting for the parameter when it is first selected
( _pg. 13, Fig. 4a_ ). To change the setting, use the UP/DOWN keys to display the new setting you want ( _Fig._
_4b_ ), then press ENTER to “Execute” (make the actual change to this setting). If you want to confirm this
setting is now the current one, just press the **RIGHT** key to scroll to the next parameter, then press **LEFT**
to go back again to the previous one. You should see the parameter setting you just made.

_**EXAMPLES-Changing the Settings of Some Common Parameters**_
Following this page, you will find tables listing all of the parameters found in the **SETUP** Menu, along
with their possible settings (or range of settings), and a detailed description of what the parameter
controls and what the settings do. If you read the previous section detailing how to select parameters
and change their settings, you should be able to dive right in, find the parameter(s) you want, and setup
the camera to suit your preferences. But maybe you’d rather walk through an example or two first:

To change any parameter’s setting, always start with the power switch in the **SETUP** position. After the
LCD comes on, press the **MENU** key.

The first parameter you will see when you enter the **SETUP** Menu is “Set Clock”. As the Time Stamp
feature is “On” by default, the camera will normally imprint the date and time on each photo or video,
based on your settings here. Press **ENTER** and use the **UP/DOWN** keys to set the hour (24-hr format,
“00”=midnight, “12”=noon), then press the **RIGHT** key move to the minute field and set it (again using
**UP/DOWN)** . Press **RIGHT** to move to the lower row and set the year, month and date using the same
method. When finished, press the **ENTER** key to confirm the new time and date settings you made.

Now press the RIGHT key one time to move to another parameter in the Menu. The parameter you will
see is “Mode”. To change it from its default setting of “Camera” (still photos) to “Video” (shoot video
clips), press the **DOWN** key to select the “Video” setting. Press the **ENTER** key to “Execute” (Set) the new
setting you’ve selected for this parameter.

10

Now press the RIGHT key to move to another parameter in the Menu. Pressing it three times will take
you to “Video Size”. Try using the **UP** and **DOWN** keys to scroll through the range of settings, then press
**ENTER** to lock in your setting for the resolution of each video clip the camera shoots.
Pressing the **RIGHT** key several more times will get you to the “Default Set” parameter. Highlight or
select “Execute” (using **UP** or **DOWN** ) and press **ENTER** to restore all parameters (including the Mode
and Video Size parameters you changed a minute ago) back to their original factory default settings. The
default settings for each parameter are indicated in bold type in the **SETUP** Menu tables on the next
several pages.

_**Field Scan 2x with Live Trigger Feature**_
Field Scan is a revolutionary new feature for the Bushnell **Core Trail Camera**, which allows you to
monitor your food plots or field edges with time lapse images or video. When set to “On”, the **Core Trail**
**Camera** will take a photo (or record a video clip) automatically at your choice of intervals (for example,
once every five minutes) during one or two blocks of time you set up for each day, **without requiring a**
**trigger from an active animal** . This has the advantage of giving you the ability to monitor the edge of a
field that might be 50 or 150 yards away from the camera out of the PIR sensor’s range. The result is an
effective range much greater than it would normally be, with the camera dependent on triggers
generated by nearby animals. This is a great tool for hunters to scout an entire field with only one

camera.

If an animal does enter the area covered by the PIR sensor and generate a trigger event during a time in
between the Field Scan intervals you set, the camera will capture an image or video just as it normally
would, based on your other menu settings. Here’s how to setup and use Field Scan (be sure you’ve set
the current time in “Set Clock” first, so your Field Scan recording will stop and start at the correct times
of day):

1. Move the main switch to **SETUP**, then press **MENU** .

2. Keep pressing the **RIGHT** key, stepping through the Setup Menu until you reach

Field Scan.

3. Press the **UP** key to select On, and press **OK** _(Step 1, pg.17)_ . You will see "A", representing the first
block of time you can define (a second block of time later in the day, "B" can also be setup if you wish).
Press **OK** _(Step 2)_ . This takes you to the screen to set Start and Stop times, which determines the clock
times when the first block of Field Scan recording will begin and end for each day.
You can set these times to the exact hour and minute you want, for a recording “window” that lasts
anywhere from just a minute to a full 24 hours.

4. Set the [Start] and [Stop] times, beginning with the Start hour, using the **UP/DOWN** keys to change
the setting _(Step 3)_ . The hour setting is based on a 24-hour clock, with “00” hours = midnight, “12” hours
= noon, “23” hrs = 11PM, etc. To move to the next setting, press the **RIGHT** key, change the minute for
the Start time with **UP/DOWN**, then on to the hour and minute settings for the Stop time.

5. After you finish setting the Stop minutes, press **OK** to confirm your settings for the first block of Field
Scan recording. If desired, you can create a second block of time by pressing the **DOWN** key to select "B"
_(Step 4)_, then press **OK** and follow the same process to set Start and Stop times for Field Scan block "B"
_(Step 5)_ . As an example of how you might use these two available time blocks, you could setup Field

11

Scan time block "A" for the dawn hours from 6 AM to 8 AM, and block "B" to capture images between
5:30 and 7 PM. No Field Scan recording would occur from 8AM to 5:30PM, or from 7PM to 6AM.

6. After setting Start/Stop times to define Field Scan block "A" and/or "B", press **OK**, then press the **UP**
or **DOWN** key to select "Interval" and press **OK** _(Step 6)_ . The Field Scan "Interval" setting lets you control
how often a photo or video clip is recorded during the block(s) of time you defined with the Start and
Stop settings. Your options are 60 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 5 minutes _(default setting, also the_
_lowest interval in video mode)_, or 1 minute _(still photo mode only)_ . Use the **UP/DOWN** keys to select
your preference, then press OK to save it _(Step 7)._ Note that for videos, "Interval" is independent of the
Length of each video recording-it’s **how often** videos are recorded, not how long each one lasts. 7.
Here’s an example of how the camera would operate, based on the following

Field Scan settings:

**Field Scan:** On

**Field Scan A:**

**[Start]:** 6:00

**[Stop]:** 8:00

**Field Scan B:**

**[Start]:** 17:30

**[Stop]:** 19:00

**Interval:** 15M

Note: avoid any "overlap" of Field Scan A & B recording blocks when setting their start and stop times,
to assure correct operation. Also-if the "Camera Mode" menu parameter is set to "Day" or "Night"
operation only, that will take priority over your Field Scan settings. Set the Camera Model to "24 HR" if
you are setting both day and night start and/or stop times in Field Scan.

These settings would cause the camera to capture a photo (or video, if the camera is set to that mode)
once every 15 minutes, beginning at 6 AM, until the Field Scan "A" recording block stops at 8:00 AM.
Later that day, the camera would again take a photo or video every 15 minutes between 5:30 PM and
7:00 PM (during Field Scan time block "B"). The next day, the camera would again record an image or
video once every 15 minutes between 6:00 and 8:00 AM, and between 5:30 and 7:00 PM. No Field Scan
recording would occur from 8AM to 5:30PM, or from 7PM to 6AM. Remember, Field Scan recording is
independent of normal triggers due to animal activity-even if no animals enter

the IR sensor coverage zone, an image or video will still be captured every 15 minutes during the
block(s) of time. If an animal triggers the camera “in between” the 15 minute intervals, it will be

recorded.

Note: Field Scan settings of frequent intervals and/or long periods between start and stop time can
reduce battery life.

**USING THE SETUP MENU INPUT SCREENS**
_**Camera Name Input**_
After selecting the Camera Name parameter (the only setting is "Input"), press **OK** .
If necessary, delete the previous or default name by pressing the **RIGHT** key until the backspace symbol (
) (located between letters "A" & "B", also between "j" & "k") is highlighted, then keep pressing **OK** .
Select (highlight) each alphanumeric character you want, using the **LEFT/RIGHT** keys, and pressing **OK**
after each one to set it. When finished naming the camera, press **MENU** to save the name to memory.

_**Coordinate Input**_
After selecting the Coordinate Input parameter, press **UP** or **DOWN** to select the On setting and press
**OK** . The latitude and longitude for any location where you plan to place the camera can be obtained at
many websites, for example: http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html . You can enter a nearby street
address, just zip code, or use the various types of maps to locate the approximate position. The format
you will need to use to enter the coordinates in the Core Trail Camera menu screen is shown below:

_Note: You may see "negative" latitude or longitude coordinates online. These designate South latitudes_
_and West longitudes. US/Canada locations will have North (+) latitude coordinates and West (-)_
_longitude coordinates._

**MOUNTING and POSITIONING the Core Trail Camera** _**Mounting**_
After you’ve set up the camera’s parameters to your personal preferences at home or in your truck,
you’re ready to take it outside and slide the power switch to “ **ON** ”. When setting up the **Core Trail**
**Camera** for scouting game or other outdoor applications, you must be sure to mount it in place correctly
and securely.
We recommend mounting the **Core Trail Camera** on a sturdy tree with a diameter of about 6 in. (15cm).
To get the optimal picture quality, the tree should be about 16-17 ft. (5 meters) away from the place to

16

be monitored, with the camera placed at a height of 5-6.5 ft. (1.5~2 m). Also, keep in mind that you will
get the best results at night when the subject is within the ideal flash range, no farther than 100ft/30m
_(119936C/119975C) an_ d no closer than 10ft (3m) from the camera.
There are two ways to mount the **Core Trail Camera** : using the provided adjustable web belt, or the
tripod socket.

Using the adjustable web belt: _Fig. 5_ illustrates using the web belt on the **Core Trail Camera** . Push one
end of the belt through the two brackets on the back of the **Core Trail Camera** . Thread the end of the
strap through the buckle. Fasten the belt securely around the tree trunk by pulling the end of the strap
firmly so there is no slack left. Using the tripod socket: The camera is equipped with a socket at the
bottom end to enable mounting on a tripod or other mounting accessories with a standard1/4-20

thread.

**Fig. 5 Attaching the Belt**

_Note: an accessory solar panel supplemental power source (#119756C) is also available -_
_please visit www.bushnell.com for more information._

_**Sensing Angle and Distance Test**_
To test whether the **Core Trail Camera** can effectively monitor the area you choose, this test is
recommended to check the sensing angle and monitoring distance of the **Core Trail Camera** . To perform

the test:

- Switch the **Core Trail Camera** to the **SETUP** mode.

- Make movements in front of the camera at several positions within the area where you expect the
game or subjects to be. Try different distances and angles from the camera.

- If the motion indicator LED light blinks, it indicates that position can be sensed If it does not blink, that
position is outside of the sensing area. The results of your testing will help you find the best placement
when mounting and aiming the **Core Trail Camera.** The height away from the ground for placing the
device should vary with the animal size appropriately. In general, 3 to 6 feet is preferred.
You can avoid potential false triggers due to temperature and motion disturbances in front of the
camera by not aiming it at a heat source or nearby tree branches or brush (especially on windy days).

_**Switching ON the Camera**_
Once you switch to the **ON** mode, the motion indicator LED (red) will blink for about 10 seconds. This
gives you time to close and lock the front cover of the **Core Trail Camera** and then walk away. During

17

this time, the motion indicator LED will blink red continuously. After it stops blinking, the PIR is active,
and any motion that is detected by it will trigger the capture of photos or videos as programmed in the
**SETUP** Menu. Be sure you have read the descriptions of the Capture Number, Interval and Sensor Level
parameters. Please note, the PIR is strongly sensitive to ambient temperature. The greater the
temperature difference between the environment and your subject, the farther the possible sensing
distance. The average sensing distance is about 60 ft.

_Before leaving the camera unattended, please check for the following:_

- Are the batteries or DC power supply inserted/connected with correct polarity and is the power level

is sufficient?

- Does the SD card have sufficient available space and is its write-protection (lock) switch off?

- Is the Power switch in the **ON** position? (Do not leave it in **SETUP** ).

**REVIEWING/DELETING THE PHOTOS/VIDEOS**
After you have setup, mounted and activated your **Core Trail Camera,** you will of course be eager to
return later and review the images it has captured for you. There are several different ways this can be

done.

_**Reviewing Images Directly From the SD Card**_
This is the most popular method of viewing images. Since unmounting the camera and taking it to your
computer isn’t very convenient, you may find it easier to just take the card out. By removing the SD card
(swapping it for a new empty card if you like) and taking it to your home or campsite to view the images
by using an SD card “reader” _(user supplied)_ connected to your computer (some computers and TVs
have a built in SD card slot), you can leave the camera in place ready to capture more images. Once
connected, the card reader works the same way as described below-please read that section if you have
any problem finding your files.

_**Reviewing Images by Connecting the Camera to a Computer**_
You can always unmount the entire camera from the tree and connect its USB port to a computer-it will
be recognized as a “removable disk”, without the need to install any drivers or software. When using a
PC (or Mac*) to view photos (or video clips*), first connect the device to the computer with a USB cable
_(not included, available at most electronics/computer retailers)_ that has a “Mini-B” USB plug on one end
(camera) and a “Standard-A” USB plug at the other end (computer). Then use commercial software with
an image browser feature, or an image browser included with the PC’s operating system to view images
saved on the SD card in the folder \DCIM\100EK113 _(a new folder will be created every 1000 images)_ .
Each new image or video will be numbered incrementally with 8 digits in order of the time it was
captured-the first 4 digits are the month and day, the last 4 digits the # of the image.

For example, you will see file names such as “09020001.JPG” or “09020001.MP4”, etc. Through the file
format suffix you can distinguish whether the file is a still photo (with suffix .JPG) or a video (with suffix
.MP4). _*video files may require additional software for viewing on a Mac._

The **Core Trail Camera** supports 3 kinds of file system formats, FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32. The default
value is FAT16 to save photos and videos. Here are some related notes:

18

- You don’t need to be concerned about the file system format of the **Core Trail Camera** unless your
equipment has problems reading the SD card. If this happens, please format the SD card with the **Core**
**Trail Camera** or in your computer first and then insert the card into your **Core Trail Camera** and try
again.

- The default file system format of the **Core Trail Camera** is FAT16, which most computers can read. If
you format an SD card for the **Core Trail Camera** in your computer, you should choose the file system
format FAT16. Normally FAT16 is recommended unless you have another image viewer that uses FAT12

or FAT32 format.

_**Deleting Photos or Videos**_
To delete all photos from the installed SD card, use the Format parameter _(see pg. 23 for details)_ .

**DOWNLOADING THE PHOTOS/VIDEOS**
To download your photos/videos to a PC or Mac*, first make sure the **Core Trail Camera** power switch is
in the **OFF** position. Connect a USB cable to the camera’s USB port, then directly to a main USB port on
your computer-do not use front panel/keyboard USB ports or unpowered “hubs”.

The **Core Trail Camera** will be recognized as a standard “USB Mass Storage” device (this may take
several seconds the first time you connect it). If you would rather leave your camera in the woods and
just pull its SD card out, an SD card reader works the same way as described in this section once the card
is inserted and the reader is connected to your computer.

With Windows XP or later, you can then simply use the options in the pop-up window to copy, view, or
print your photos ( _right_ ).
On all Windows OS, the **Core Trail Camera** will also be listed as a “Removable Disk” if you open the “My
Computer” window (on Macs, an icon will appear on your desktop).

The **Core Trail Camera** ’s photo files are named “09020001.JPG” etc, and are located in the
“DCIM\100EK113” folder on this “Removable Disk”. Video file names will end with “.MP4”. You may
copy the photos/ videos to your hard drive as you would any file-just copy/paste or drag the file names
or icons to your drive or desktop.

After the photos are copied to your hard drive, you can disconnect the **Core Trail Camera** . (On Mac
computers, drag the “disk” that appeared on your desktop when the camera was connected into your
Trash to “eject” it before disconnecting.) The .JPG format photo files from the **Core Trail Camera** may be
viewed and edited with any photo software you choose to use. The .MP4 video files may be viewed with
the Windows Media Player on PCs with Windows 7. If your computer is running an older version of
Windows, or you are on a Mac, and you don’t already have a compatible video player, you can
download a free version of the DivX player from http://www.divx.com/.

**TROUBLESHOOTING / FAQ**

**Camera takes continuous images of no subject**
A camera has what is known as a “false trigger” if the PIR sensor thinks that there is motion and heat in
front of the camera lens when there is no subject in the image. These “False Triggers” are the result of

19

placing the camera in an environment where there is motion associated with tree branches creating
motion in front of the camera or an area where there is high heat in the foreground and any motion
from wind could set off the camera. Setting a camera up over water is also a potential cause for this
issue. To remedy this situation:
1. Try moving the camera to an area that does not have any of these issues or try changing the sensor
level on the menu settings.
2. If the camera continues to take images when there is no subject in them, try placing the camera in an
inside environment and aiming at a location where there is no motion.
3. If the camera continues to show issues, then there is probably an electronic component issue. If this is
the case, please contact our customer service to send the camera back for repair.

**Battery life is shorter than expected**
1. Battery life will vary with operating temperature and the number of images taken over time. Setting
the Interval time to 0.6 second will decrease battery life. Typically, the **Core Trail Camera** will be able to
capture several thousand images before the batteries die.
2. Check to make sure you have used new alkaline or lithium batteries. Bushnell recommends using
Energizer® Lithium AA batteries in your Core Trail Camera model to obtain maximum battery life.
3. Make sure that the power switch was turned to the “On” position and that the camera was not left in
“Setup” mode while in the field.
4. Make sure that you are using a good quality name brand SD card in your camera.
Bushnell recommends SanDisk® brand SD Cards up to 32GB _(Ultra® or_
_Extreme® series for HD video)_ . Our experience indicates that poor quality SD cards can sometimes
reduce your **Core Trail Camera** battery life.

**Camera stops taking images or won’t take images**
1. Please make sure that the SD card is not full. If the card is full, the camera will stop taking images.
2. Check the batteries to make sure that they are new alkaline or lithium AA batteries. _See note above_
_about short battery life._
3. Make sure that the camera power switch is in the **“On** ” position and not in the **“Off”** or **“Setup”**

modes.

4. Make sure that you are using a good quality SD card in your camera. Bushnell recommends SanDisk®
SD Cards up to 32GB _(Ultra® or Extreme® series for HD video)_ .
5. If the SD card has its write protect switch in the lock position, the camera will not take images.
6. If you have used an SD card in another device before inserting it in your **Core Trail Camera**, you might
want to try formatting the card using the “Format” parameter in Setup mode (make sure you have
backed up any important files first, as formatting will erase all previous files). In some cases, other
devices may change the formatting of the SD card so that it will not work properly with the **Core Trail**

**Camera** .

**Camera won’t power up**
1. Make sure that you have installed 8 batteries in the battery compartment. Bushnell recommends
using Energizer® Lithium AA batteries in your Core Trail Camera.
2. Make sure that the batteries are installed correctly, observing proper polarity. Always place the
negative (flat) end of each battery in contact with the spring side of its slot inside the camera.
3. After moving the switch from **“Off”** to **“Setup”** or **“On”**, make sure that the switch is correctly in
position to ensure the proper mode (avoid positions “between” two modes).
4. Do not move the switch directly from **“On”** to **“Setup”** -always move the switch all the way down to
**“Off”** first, then back up to **“Setup”** . **Still Photo and/or Video Quality Problems**

20

_1. Night photos or videos appear too dark_

_a_ . Check the battery indicator icon to see if battery power is full. The flash will stop operating
near the end of the battery life.
_b._ You will get the best results when the subject is within the ideal flash range, no farther than
80ft/24m _(119938C/119977C)_ or 100 ft/30m _(119936C/119975C)_ . Subjects may appear too dark
at greater distances.
_c_ . Please note that when the Capture Number parameter is set higher than "1Photo", or with

very short Interval settings, some images may appear darker than others due to the quick

response and rapid retriggering of the camera, allowing less time for the flash to fully recharge

before firing again.

_d_ . Make sure "LED Control" in the setup menu is set to "High" to ensure maximum output.
Check that "NV Shutter" in the menu is set to "Auto" and not "High", as higher shutter speeds
can result in darker images.
_e._ The ARD (anti-reflective device) shield can be removed to maximize flash output. See
_2. Daytime photos or videos appear too dark_
Make sure that the camera is not aimed at the sun or other light sources during the day, as this may
cause the auto exposure to produce darker results.
_3. Night photos or videos appear too bright_
If the subject is close to the camera (less than10ft/3m), change the LED Control parameter in the Setup
Menu to "Medium" or "Low". Set trigger Interval to 2S or above.
_4. Daytime photos or videos appear too bright_
Make sure that the light sensor will not be in the shade (from tree leaves/ branches) while the camera
lens is aimed into a bright area during the day.
_5. Photos with streaked subject_

_a_ . In some cases with low lighting conditions and fast moving subjects, the 4K or HIGH resolution
settings may not perform as well as the HD setting.
_b_ . If you have multiple images where fast moving subjects produce streaks on the photo, try the
HD setting instead.

_c_ . Set Interval to 2S or above to reduce motion blur.

_d_ . Set "NV Shutter" to "Fast Motion" to minimize motion blur.

_6. Red, green or blue color cast_

_a_ . Under certain lighting conditions, the sensor can become confused resulting in poor color
images.
_b_ . If this is seen on a consistent basis, then the sensor may need servicing.

Please contact Bushnell customer service.

_7. Short video clips--not recording to the length expected_

_a_ . Check to make sure that the SD card is not full.

_b_ . Make sure that the camera has good batteries in it. Near the end of the battery life, the

camera may choose to record shorter video clips to conserve power.

_c_ . When LED Control is set to "High" and camera is in Video mode, the maximum video length in
"Dynamic" mode at night is 15 seconds, to avoid potential overheating of batteries and/or

electronic components. Maximum video length available when set to "Dynamic" in daytime is 2

minutes.

**Date/Time Stamp not appearing on images**

21

Make sure that the **“Time Stamp”** parameter is set to **“On”** .

**Photos Do Not Capture Subject of Interest**

1. Check the “Sensor Level” (PIR sensitivity) parameter setting. For warm temperature conditions,

set the Sensor Level to “High” and for cold weather use, set the sensor for “Low”. For variable
weather, use "Auto".
2. Try to set your camera up in an area where there is not a heat source in the camera’s line of

sight.
3. In some cases, setting the camera near water will make the camera take images with no subject

in them. Try aiming the camera over ground.
4. Try to avoid setting the camera up on small trees that are prone to being moved by strong

winds.

5. Remove any limbs which are right in front of the camera lens.

**PIR Sensor LED Flashes/Doesn’t Flash**
1. When the camera is in the “Setup” mode, a special LED on the front of the camera will flash when it
senses motion. This is for setup purposes only and will help the user aim the camera.
2. During use, the LED will not flash when the camera takes an image. This is to help keep the camera
hidden from game.

**LCD Screen Issues**
_1. LCD screen powers on but no text is present._

_a_ . After moving the switch from “Off” to “Setup” or “On”, make sure that the switch is correctly
in position to ensure the proper mode (avoid positions “between” two modes).
_b_ . Do not move the switch directly from “On” to “Setup”-always move the switch all the way
down to “Off” first, then back up to “Setup”.
_2. LCD screen shows a faint black line after turning from “Setup” to “On”._ The LCD will turn
off when you slide the switch to the “On” position. In some cases, this black line will appear and then
fade in about 1 second. This is normal and the camera will function properly.
_3. Screen comes on but then powers off_
Make sure that you have installed the SD card correctly.

**Camera won’t retain settings**
Make sure that you have been saving the changes to any parameter settings that you made while in
Setup mode, by pressing **“OK”** after changing the setting. If you don’t save your new setting after
changing it, the camera will continue to use the original default setting for that parameter.

**Moisture or Ants Inside Camera**

1. To ensure humidity or rain is kept out of the camera, secure the DC In plug firmly in place.
2. Ants can be attracted by low level electronic vibrations, and enter through any gaps between the
exterior and interior of the camera. Make sure the DC In plug is securely attached.

**Field Scan (Time Lapse) not working properly**
1. Make sure that the stop and start times of Field Scan "A" and "B" do not overlap (for example, do not
set the start time of "B" to 8AM if the stop time of "A" is 10AM).
2. When using Field Scan in video mode, the smallest interval time available is 5 min, to avoid potential
overheating of the batteries and electronic components, which could cause operational failure or
damage to the camera. In still photo mode, a 1 min. Interval can be set.

22

**CAUTION:** DO NOT USE the 0.6s Interval setting for Video at night at a feeder or similar environment. It
may cause the LEDs to continue firing over a long period of time, which may overheat and shorten the
operating life of the internal electronic components.

Do not mix old and new batteries.

Do not mix battery types-use ALL lithium or ALL alkaline.
Rechargeable batteries are not recommended.

**FCC COMPLIANCE STATEMENT:**

FCC STATEMENT
Changes not expressly approved by Primos® could void the user’s authority to operate the
equipment.

Note: This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital
device, pursuant to Part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable
protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates,
uses and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with
the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no
guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment does
cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning
the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or
more of the following measures:

- Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.

- Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver.

- Connect the equipment into an output on a circuit different from that to which the receiver is
connected.

- Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician for help.

Shielded interface cable must be used with the equipment in order to comply with the
limits for a digital device pursuant to Subpart B of Part 15 of FCC Rules. Specifications
and designs are subject to change without any notice or obligation on the part of the
manufacturer.

This device complies with Part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two
conditions: (1) this device may not cause harmful interference, and (2) this device must accept
any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation. Please
note that changes or modifications not expressly approved by the party responsible for
compliance could void the user’s authority to operate the equipment.

This equipment contains electric and/or electronic parts and must therefore not be disposed of as
normal household waste. Instead, it should be disposed at the respective collection points for recycling
provided by the communities. For you, this is free of charge.

If the equipment contains exchangeable (rechargeable) batteries, these too must be removed before
and, if necessary, in turn be disposed of according to the relevant regulations (see also the respective
comments in this unit’s instructions).

collection company, or in the store where you purchased this equipment.
