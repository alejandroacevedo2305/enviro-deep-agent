## PREFACE

This Standard was prepared by the Standards Australia Committee CE-005, Explosives, to
supersede AS 2187.2--1993, Explosives--Storage, transport and use, Part 2: Use of
explosives.

The objective of this Standard is to provide requirements, information, and guidance for the
use of explosives, the management of a site where explosives are used and the destruction
of excess or deteriorated explosives, which ensure risks are acceptable minimized. This
Standard is for reference by manufacturers, suppliers, and users of explosives. In addition,
it is for reference by regulators and beneficiaries of activities involving explosives.

The major changes in this revision include the following:

(a) Inclusion of requirements for large operations.

(b) Adoption of a risk management approach with a greater emphasis on planning.

(c) Use of the term ‘close proximity’ in lieu of specific distances.

(d) Where appropriate, removal of reference to approval by authorities.

(e) Inclusion of requirements for electronic and remote blasting.

(f) Significant changes to ground vibration and airblast overpressure assessment.

(g) Inclusion of a new appendix covering exclusion zones.

(h) Inclusion of requirements for the use of explosives in atmospheres greater than
atmospheric pressure.

This Standard is one of a series which includes the following:

AS

2187.0 Explosives--Storage, transport and use--Terminology
2187.1 Explosives--Storage, transport and use--Storage
2187.2 Explosives--Storage, transport and use--Use of explosives (this part)
2187.3 Explosives--Storage, transport and use--Pyrotechnics--Shopgoods fireworks--
Design, performance and testing
2187.4 Explosives--Storage, transport and use--Pyrotechnics--Outdoor displays

The terms ‘normative’ and ‘informative’ have been used in this Standard to define the

application of the appendix to which they apply. A ‘normative’ appendix is an integral part
of a Standard, whereas an ‘informative’ appendix is only for information and guidance.

## FOREWORD

Explosives are a concentrated source of energy, and because of their chemical properties
are capable of inflicting death or injury to persons or damage to property or the
environment. Similarly, they present a security problem if someone has unlawful possession
of explosives or if explosives are in the hands of the inexperienced or those with ill intent.

Explosives thus present a high risk with potentially severe consequences unless stored,
transported and used by competent persons in a safe and secure manner.

This Standard provides information on hazards presented by explosives and ways to manage
and control the identified risks at a level that is acceptable to the community and in
accordance with safe and secure industrial practice.

It is highly recommended that persons required to handle and use explosives are familiar
with AS/NZS 4360, Risk management. Similarly, it is recommended that management
plans, used to facilitate safe work procedures, plans and processes dealing with explosives,
be based on AS/NZS 4804, Occupational health and safety management systems--General
guidelines on principles, systems and supporting techniques.

For the purpose of this Standard it is a fundamental requirement that persons are competent
and authorized by their employer to handle and use explosives. Competence, with respect to
handling and use of explosives, is recognized through compliance with relevant legislation
and by having documentation confirming one or both of the following:

1 Current and valid shot firing ticket or licence applicable in the relevant State or
Territory.

2 Currency with relevant competencies or qualification, attained through a national
training package (i.e., endorsed under the national training system of the Department
of Education, Science and Training).

Employers of persons who handle and use explosives also have responsibilities with regard
to the safe and secure management of explosives by ensuring that systems are in place
through legislation and their management plan (if required) to provide a safe place of work.
From a security viewpoint, the presence and security of explosives on a worksite is the
ultimate responsibility of the employer.

Frequent reference is made in this Standard to the risk management process, risk analysis
and risk controls; it is fundamental that persons using or referencing this Standard have a
basic understanding of these terms.

Some hazards or risk controls associated with the handling and use of explosives may not
be referenced in this Standard. This is not a deliberate omission but the application of
proper risk management techniques should be sufficient for such hazards to be identified for
specific or unusual situations relevant to individual work sites.

be blasted shall be carried out. On the basis of the investigation, in conjunction with
considerations detailed in but not limited to Section 12, a blast management plan
incorporating a risk assessment shall be prepared by a competent person. No blasting shall
commence until the blast management plan has been authorized by a competent person. The
blast management plan shall be in accordance with Appendix A.

Where conditions revealed during execution of the blasting operation necessitate changes in
the blast management plan, notification shall be given and authorization confirmed before
the proposed changes are commenced except in emergency situations.

Planning shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

(a) Risk assessment.

(b) A site safety management plan.

(c) Blast design.

detailed risk assessment of the operation shall be carried out and appropriate operating
procedures developed to ensure all identified hazards have been reduced to an acceptable
level.

This Section provides requirements for the manufacture of ANFO and for mobile mixing
units.

Most jurisdictions require that preparation areas, raw material storage areas and mixing
equipment be duly licensed. States and Territories of the Commonwealth may have
legislation that applies to site manufacture of explosives.

3.2 MATERIALS

The materials used in the mixing of explosives on site shall be either in accordance with
Clause 3.5.2 for ANFO or as specified by the manufacturer for other explosives. Variations
shall not be made to either the constituent materials or the method of mixing.

Ingredients used in the mixing of explosives shall be stored and transported such as to
prevent accidental mixing.

Ingredients shall be clean and free of all foreign materials.

A comprehensive waste disposal plan for the collection and disposal of waste ingredients
and waste packaging materials shall be in place. This shall take into account the possibility
of all waste being contaminated with explosives.

3.3 FIRE PRECAUTIONS ON MIXING SITES

The following precautions shall be taken to minimize the possibility of fire at any place
where explosives are mixed:

(a) Surroundings within close proximity shall be kept clean and free from all combustible
material.

(b) Smoking shall not be permitted within close proximity.

(c) Operations constituting a fire hazard, such as welding, grinding, cutting or the like,
shall not be conducted on or within close proximity of a mixing plant unless all mixed
explosive has been isolated from the source of possible ignition.

(d) A detailed evacuation plan shall be developed to quickly and safely evacuate people
from the site and immediate surrounds to a safe place in case a fire gets out of
control. The safe place shall be as set out in the risk management plan.

NOTES:

1 In large mixing houses, not of a temporary nature, a water flooding system with external
valves is recommended so that all equipment and adjacent areas may be flooded at the first
sign of fire. An appropriate open drainage system directed to an area where the propagation of
fire can be contained is also recommended.

2 Because of the possibility of explosion, if a fire that cannot be controlled occurs, the area
should be evacuated in accordance with established procedures.

### 3 Appendix C gives guidance on fire precautions.

The treatment of fires should be a component of the blast management plan.

3.4 MIXING APPLIANCES AND BUILDINGS

3.4.1 Appliances

Appliances and associated equipment used for mixing explosives shall comply with the
following:

(a) Materials used in the construction of such equipment shall be compatible with all the
ingredients, particularly ammonium nitrate. Where contact with ammonium nitrate
cannot be avoided, galvanized steels, zinc, copper and alloys of these metals shall not
be used (see Note 1).

(b) Machines used for mixing shall--

(i) be designed to minimize the possibility of frictional heating, compaction,
overloading, accumulation of compositions and confinement;

(ii) have bearings, motors or gears protected from spillages of material (see
Note 2); and

(iii) be designed to facilitate cleaning operations.

(c) All systems used for the measuring of ingredients shall be calibrated in accordance
with manufacturers’ recommendations.

(d) The frames of all mixers and any associated equipment shall be effectively bonded
and a continuous electrical path to earth provided.

(e) Spark ignition (petrol-fuelled) engines shall not be used for power-operated mixers.

(f) In the construction of mixing appliances, the potential for build-up of explosive
mixtures shall be avoided (see Note 3).

NOTES:

1 Certain materials form sensitive compounds with ammonium nitrate, which may be
hazardous. For this reason, their use is prohibited for mixing vessels, internal linings or where
the material is likely to come into contact with ammonium nitrate, ANFO or similar mixtures.
This also precludes their use as corrosion-resistant treatments for internal fastening devices
for linings such as nails or screws. Steel, stainless steel, aluminium and some anti-static
plastics materials are generally suitable.

2 Bearings that have cotton or similar materials used as packing should not be used.

### 3 Solid sections (e.g., rods, angles, channels and T-sections) are preferred. Hollow sections,

especially those that are sealed, represent a particular hazard should explosive mixtures work
their way behind faulty welds or into worn parts. If hollow sections are used, they should be
left open and/or provision made for cleaning.

4 Plain steel nails and screws may be used but they suffer from the serious disadvantage of
accelerated corrosion in the presence of ammonium nitrate.

3.4.2 Mobile mixing units

In addition to the general requirements set out in Clause 3.4.1, mobile mixing units shall
comply with the following where applicable:

NOTE: Requirements for the transport of dangerous goods are set out in the Australian Code for

3.5 MANUFACTURE OF ANFO

3.5.1 General

ANFO (Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil) is an explosive that is often mixed on-site or close to
the point of use. It is relatively simple to manufacture. Mixing and handling of ANFO shall
be with done with extreme care. ANFO is ideal for use in dry blastholes but its performance
can be readily affected by moisture or wet conditions. Ammonium nitrate is very soluble in

water.

3.5.2 Materials

3.5.2.1 Ammonium nitrate

Only porous prilled ammonium nitrate shall be used in the manufacture of ANFO. Other
forms of ammonium nitrate should not be used as misfires can result.

3.5.2.2 Fuel oil

Fuel oil, or other oil used for mixing with ammonium nitrate, shall be clean, with a closedcup flashpoint of 60.5°C or higher. The oil shall be of such a viscosity that it is readily
absorbed by the ammonium nitrate.

NOTE: Automotive diesel fuel (distillate) is recommended for standard ANFO.

3.5.2.3 Additional materials

The addition of other materials, such as polystyrene or aluminium powder, when used, shall
be in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications. Such additions may require
regulatory approval.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

19 AS 2187.2--2006

3.5.2.4 Colouring agent

A colouring agent, which is soluble in the fuel oil, should be used as a guide to ensure that
the fuel oil is uniformly and thoroughly blended with the ammonium nitrate. The use of a
colouring agent will also enable mixed explosive product to be readily differentiated from
the unmixed ingredients.

3.5.3 Mixing of ANFO

The ammonium nitrate and fuel oil shall be thoroughly blended to create a uniform mix.

Fuel oil used to manufacture ANFO shall be nominally 6% by mass of ammonium nitrate.
The quantity of fuel oil is critical. Excess oil leads to a slight reduction in blasting effect
and a moderate increase in the volume of toxic fumes released; and insufficient oil leads to
a considerable reduction in blasting effect and a moderate increase in the volume of toxic
fumes released.

Table 3.5.3 gives the correct proportions to be used for quantities of ammonium nitrate up

in a receptacle suitable and safe for its intended purpose and placed in a magazine.

NOTES:

1 Explosives should be mixed as required and in quantities sufficient only for current use.

2 Prolonged storage of ANFO can result in oil migration or absorption of water, with a resultant
loss of sensitivity in the explosive, which can result in misfires.

#### 3 Oil migration or absorption of ammonium nitrate can create a fire hazard in timber-lined

magazines.

predicted during the charging period, a review of the required charging should be
undertaken in accordance with the blast management plan. This is especially important for
operations where circumstances require charging and firing to be completed in a limited
time period.

6.1.5 Precautions at site

The operation shall establish, within the blasting plan, a non-work-zone around the blast
area. The non-work-zone should be established taking into consideration vehicle
movements adjacent to the blast area, plant maintenance and other non-blasting-related
activities.

Where charging operations are occurring at more than one location at a particular site,
adequate communication shall be maintained between each operation if there is a likelihood
of one or more of the locations affecting another.

There shall be no sources of ignition introduced into the blast area other than that which is
required to initiate the shot. This shall not preclude the plant required for charging
operations. Plant to be used in the blast area shall be assessed for its suitability and
unacceptable risks shall be mitigated before it is used.

that all potential vehicle interactions with initiation systems are identified and managed.
For example, where signal tube initiation systems are used, entanglement may occur with a
moving vehicle and this is the main mechanism by which ‘snap, slap and shoot’ incidents
occur, which can cause unintended initiation.

The impact of vehicular traffic on the area should be subject to risk assessment and control
measures should be developed. Issues that should be included in the risk assessment are the
following:

(a) Access to and around the blast area.

(b) The interaction of vehicles with other vehicles and personnel.

(c) The blasthole layout and the ability to reach each blasthole without driving over
blastholes or explosive products.

(d) Control of activities on or immediately adjacent to a blast site.

As a result of this process, the following outcomes should be attained:

(i) Traffic management is incorporated in the blast management plan.

(ii) Difficult to reach blastholes are identified and subsequent loading plans are prepared,
e.g., load difficult to reach blastholes first.

(iii) The maximum number of vehicles allowed in the blast area at any one time is
declared in the blast plan and controlled on site.

(iv) Procedures for the management of vehicles caught in difficult situations should be
prepared.

6.1.7 Blasthole measuring

The blastholes shall be checked prior to loading for location, depth, diameter, angle and
presence of water.

A system of blasthole identification should be developed. Such a system should aid in the
clear communication of loading requirements, especially for blastholes requiring special
treatment. Examples of issues that require identification include the following:

(a) Blastholes that contain water.

(b) Blastholes that are to be decked.

(c) The initiation blasthole.

(d) Blastholes that have partially or fully collapsed.

(e) Blastholes that vary from the blast plan.

When variances from the blast management plan are discovered, their effects should be
assessed and any unacceptable risks should be mitigated.

6.1.8 Loading sequence

The sequence of loading should ensure safe and efficient blast charging and take into
account vehicle movements. Loading should be undertaken in a sequence that enables a
portion of the blast to be sectioned off, tied and initiated, if an unexpected event occurs
before all loading is completed, e.g., thunderstorm approaches.

6.1.9 Sleeping

Where charged blastholes are left unfired, adequate safety and security measures shall be
developed and implemented to protect people and property.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

29 AS 2187.2--2006

The blast management plan should include procedures for sleeping charged blastholes, and
considerations include, but are not limited to, the following:

(a) The explosive manufacturer’s recommendations.

(b) Temperature of the ground.

(c) Groundwater.

(d) Steps to be taken to secure the area from unauthorized entry.

6.1.10 Night loading or poor visibility

Where blastholes are being loaded when natural sunlight is not adequate to light the blast
area, additional hazards arise, which shall be identified and addressed. Such hazards include
but are not limited to the following:

(a) Artificial light glare.

(b) Shadow formation.

(c) Visibility of blasthole locations and personnel working on the blast (i.e., the ability to
see and be seen).

(d) Fatigue.

(e) Identification of correct charging materials.

(f) Taking and recording correct charging measurements.

6.2 PNEUMATIC CHARGING

Where pneumatic charging devices are used, they shall be effectively electrically earthed,
and semi-conductive (antistatic) loading tubes shall be used. Such tubing shall have a
resistance of not less than 15 × 10 [3] Ω/m and shall be of such length that its resistance is not
more than 2 MΩ. The resistance shall be measured as described in BS 2050.

The charging devices and associated equipment shall be earthed to give a total resistance to
earth of not more than 1 MΩ. Water lines, compressed air lines, wire-covered hoses, rail or
permanent electrical earthing systems shall not be used as a means of earthing.

NOTE: The possibility that pneumatic charging devices may generate static electricity, which
may accumulate in sufficient amounts to cause premature detonation of the priming charge, have
to be recognized. Before pneumatic charging is employed in any operation, thorough tests, using
appropriate equipment, should be made to evaluate this hazard. Pneumatic devices should not be
used in full-scale operation until such tests are completed and evaluated (including the
introduction of additional safety factors to account for all variations in rock conductivity,
sensitivity, temperature, humidity and air pressure that might occur).

6.3 PREPARATION OF CHARGES

6.3.1 Capping safety fuse

6.3.1.1 Capping site

The fitting of fuses to detonators shall not be carried out within close proximity of a
magazine or other place where explosives are stored, and then only in an area protected
from weather and dust.

Capped fuses not required for immediate use shall be placed in a suitable receptacle or
stored in a detonator magazine.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 30

6.3.1.2 Safety fuse

Safety fuse used shall comply with the following requirements:

(a) It shall be inspected for damage and tested for burning rate, both on receipt and prior
to use, to ensure that its condition has not been adversely affected by storage.

(b) If damaged in any way, it shall not be used.

(c) If being used in damp conditions, the first and last 300 mm of exposed fuse shall be
discarded if left for periods in excess of 1 h.

(d) The burning rate of safety fuse, when determined on 1 m long samples, shall be such
that a sample shall burn in not less than 90 s and not more than 120 s when tested at
sea level.

(e) The minimum length of fuse for all charges shall be 1 m. In any event the length shall
be such that the person firing the charge has sufficient time to withdraw from the
blasting area to a safe location without undue haste.

(f) The end of the fuse for insertion in the detonator shall be cut square, and only an end
that is dry, clean and freshly cut shall be inserted into any detonator.

NOTE: The end of the fuse intended for lighting should also be freshly cut.

6.3.1.3 Inspection of plain detonators

Before insertion of the fuse, detonators shall be examined to ensure they are not physically
damaged, deteriorated or otherwise corroded and are free from condensation or foreign

matter.

WARNING: DO NOT CLEAN DETONATORS BY BLOWING OR PRICKING WITH

ANY TOOL OR IMPLEMENT.

6.3.1.4 Insertion of fuse in detonators

A fuse shall be inserted into a detonator by being pushed gently, without twisting, into
contact with the detonator composition. The detonator shall be crimped to the fuse,
3 to 5 mm from the open rim of the detonator, by means of a purpose-made crimper.

NOTE: The detonator should be held in such a manner as to reduce the possibility of personal
injury in the event of accidental detonation, i.e., pointing away from the body.

WARNING: A CAPPED FUSE CAN BE INITIATED BY STATIC ELECRICITY.

6.3.1.5 Waterproofing of detonator and fuse junction

Where a fuse is used in a blasthole or any situation containing free water, the crimp at the
junction of the fuse and detonator shall be made waterproof.

NOTE: If necessary, waterproofing compounds that are not reactive with explosives or the safety
fuse may be used.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

31 AS 2187.2--2006

6.3.2 Testing electric detonators

Where electric detonators are tested for electrical resistance before use, such tests shall be
performed using a circuit tester as specified in Appendix B and the detonator under test
shall be so shielded that no injury can result to persons in the vicinity. Such tests shall be
conducted in a manner that precludes the possibility of detonation of other explosives
should the detonator itself explode. The detonator shall not be used if the electric resistance
is not within the range given in the manufacturer’s specification.

NOTES:

1 The electrical resistance of each electric detonator should be tested individually before use.

2 The time that a detonator is kept in a shield should be at least twice the delay time of the
detonator.

3 Steel pipe used as a shield should not be less than 50 mm diameter as it may fragment when
in contact with an exploding detonator. A 50 mm diameter steel tube (minimum wall
thickness 3 mm) or a bucket of dry sand into which the detonator is fully inserted would
normally be suitable.

6.3.3 Preparation of primers

Primers should be made up immediately prior to charging.

The initiating medium used to form a primer shall have sufficient strength and sufficient
contact with the primer cartridge (or in the case of cast primers their design for use will be
such) to ensure initiation and shall be attached in such a way that it will not become
detached from the primer cartridge during loading.

Where a primer is to be lowered into a blasthole by means of the lead wires, safety fuse,
detonating cord or signal tube, the mass of the primer shall not exceed one-third of the
breaking strain of the weaker component. If the breaking strain is not known, the mass of
the primer shall not exceed the following:

(a) Detonating cord ........................................................................................... 12.5 kg.

(b) Lead wire ......................................................................................................... 2 kg.

(c) Signal tube ....................................................................................................... 2 kg.

(d) Safety fuse ........................................manufacturer’s or supplier’s recommendations.

When detonators are used as the initiating medium, they shall be attached to the primer
cartridge in such a way that during loading no tension is applied to the safety fuse, lead
wires or signal tube where they enter the detonator.

NOTES:

1 It is essential that manufacturer’s or supplier’s recommendations be strictly adhered to, to
ensure that the initiating medium is of sufficient strength to initiate the primer cartridge.

2 Side initiation of the principal charge or stemming disruption may occur with detonating cord
downlines.

3 Additional information on the preparation of primers is provided in Appendix D.

4 It is essential that manufacturer’s recommendations be strictly adhered to, to ensure that the
initiating medium is of sufficient strength to initiate the primer cartridge.

6.4 BOOSTERS/PACKAGED PRODUCTS

6.4.1 Cutting of cartridges

The cutting of cartridges to reduce the mass charge, or for any other reason, is not
recommended unless manufacturer’s instructions regarding the cutting of cartridges or other
specialist packaged products are followed.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 32

6.4.2 Location of primer

The primer shall be located in the blasthole in such a position as to minimize the risk of
non-initiation through being cut off during the blasting sequence.

In the case of surface blasting, the primer should be placed in the bottom part of the
explosive column in the blasthole with the detonator facing the charge. In deep blastholes,
mid and top priming may be included was well as bottom priming.

NOTE: This sequence is intended to ensure initiation of the charge and that no unexploded
explosive remains after firing.

6.5 SURFACE CHARGING

6.5.1 General requirements

Blastholes shall be loaded in accordance with the blast design and loading sequence. Each
initiation system shall be adequately secured to prevent it from falling into, and
subsequently being lost in, a blasthole.

If during the charging it is noticed that a blasthole deformity or loss of initiation system has
occurred, the shotfirer shall be notified. The shotfirer shall then determine an appropriate
course of action.

It is the responsibility of the shotfirer to ensure that the intended explosive products are
loaded. The shotfirer should therefore monitor the deliveries to, and/or manufacture of
explosives at, the blasting operation. Where the shotfirer is not satisfied that the intended
products are being used, the shotfirer shall instigate appropriate corrective action, which
may include the stoppage of loading.

6.5.2 Charging wet blastholes

6.5.2.1 General

Blastholes containing water should not be charged with explosives (for example ANFO),
including initiation systems, whose performance is affected by the presence of water unless
appropriate measures are taken to ensure that the explosive in use is not affected. Examples
of such measures include sleeving, decking, de-watering, waterproofing or the use of
waterproof explosives.

WARNING: THE USE OF PLASTIC-LINED OR PLASTIC-SLEEVED BLASTHOLES

GREATLY INCREASES THE RISK OF ACCIDENTAL INITIATION BY STATIC

ELECTRICITY.

NOTE: When selecting explosives for use in wet blastholes, the effect of water on the explosives
should be considered where extended sleep time is planned or likely.

Where there are wet and dry blastholes, those that contain water shall be identified and
clearly marked.

6.5.2.2 Dewatering

Where dewatering of blastholes is carried out, this activity shall be undertaken by a
competent person.

7.1 SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

Before charging commences, unauthorized personnel and machinery not involved with the
blasting operations shall be removed from the area.

Warning signs shall be displayed advising that blasting operations are in progress.

NOTE: Information for signs used on public roads is provided in AS 1742.3 and AS 1743.

The following precautions should be observed during charging operations:

(a) In order to avoid delays and the consequent increased risk, all equipment required for
the charging operation should be ready on site before charging commences. This
includes adequate stemming and explosive materials.

(b) Appropriate records should be kept (see Appendix A).

7.2 PRECAUTIONS AT SITE

No work or vehicular activity, other than that associated with the charging operation, shall
be performed within close proximity of a blasthole or initiation system. Where vehicular
access is essential, special procedures shall be developed and implemented to prevent the
vehicle damaging or initiating the blast.

If charging operations are occurring at more than one location at a particular site, adequate
communication shall be maintained between each operation.

There shall be no smoking, naked lights, or machinery likely to generate heat or sparks
within close proximity of any blasthole being charged. A risk assessment shall be conducted
and controls implemented before machinery that is likely to generate heat or sparks is used
within this safety distance.

In normal operations, charging shall not begin unless it is practicable to complete the
charging and firing operation on the same day, and in no circumstances shall charged
blastholes be left unattended or unsecured. Where charging operations may continue over a
period of more than one day, a risk assessment shall be conducted and any necessary
control measures shall be implemented.

7.3 BLASTHOLES (CLEANLINESS)

Blastholes shall be thoroughly cleaned of all loose material before charging. If not charged
immediately, blastholes shall be plugged or otherwise protected to prevent debris entering
the blasthole.

NOTE: Each blasthole should be examined before insertion of the charge.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 34

7.4 INSERTION OF CHARGE

7.4.1 Procedure

Undue force shall not be used to insert the charge in the blasthole. Except in the case of
deck charging, care shall be taken to avoid the presence of extraneous matter between
cartridges.

NOTES:

1 If an obstruction is encountered in a blasthole after charging of that blasthole has begun, the
obstruction may be removed using either a flow of water or water and compressed air. If the
obstruction cannot be removed, charging, which should include an additional primer, may
continue provided the charge is not too near the collar and therefore result in unwanted noise
or fly.

2 Blastholes that are charged with a primer above an obstruction can give rise to additional
noise, toe, and vibration problems if multi-row firing is used.

3 Safety fuses, lead wires, detonating cords or signal tubes should be secured firmly at the
collars of blastholes to prevent their ends from being drawn down and lost in the blasthole
during the remainder of the charging operation.

7.4.2 Free-flowing granular explosives

7.4.2.1 General

When using free-flowing granular explosives, care shall be taken to ensure continuity of the
charge.

NOTE: For gravity-fed situations, this will normally be ensured if the angle of the blasthole is
limited to a maximum of 30° from the vertical. Free-flowing granular explosives may be
pneumatically charged into blastholes at any angle.

7.4.2.2 Protected-type detonators

Protected-type detonators shall be used when pneumatic charging and electric firing of freeflowing granular explosives are employed.

NOTE: Because of the possibility of static discharge causing premature detonation--

(a) electric detonators should not be placed in plastic tubes; and

(b) free-flowing granular explosives should not be poured or pneumatically loaded into paper or
plastic liners containing detonators.

7.4.3 Cutting of cartridges

Where practicable, only whole cartridges shall be charged into blastholes.

Where it is essential and safe to cut nitroglycerine-based cartridges to provide a correct
mass charge, such cartridges shall not be cut against a hard, metallic, or rock-like surface.

7.4.4 Location of primer

The primer shall be located in the blasthole in such a position as to minimize the risk of
non-initiation through being cut off during the blasting sequence.

NOTE: In general, the primer should be placed in the bottom part of the explosive column in the
blasthole with the detonator facing the charge. In deep blastholes, mid and top priming may be
included as well as bottom priming. This sequence is intended to ensure initiation of the charge
and that no unexploded explosive remains after firing.

7.4.5 Pumpable explosives

When delivering pumpable explosives into a blasthole, controls shall be implemented to
ensure the following:

(a) The explosive is mixed according to the manufacturer’s specifications.

(b) The operator remains at the control panel or control device.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

35 AS 2187.2--2006

(c) Spillage does not occur.

(d) Overfilling of the blasthole does not occur.

7.5 STEMMING

7.5.1 Stemming material

A wide variety of material may be used as stemming material, and the requirements vary
with the size of the blasthole and the site conditions.

NOTE: Appendix E, which covers flyrock and fly, gives guidance for choosing appropriate
stemming material.

The following should be considered:

(a) In small diameter (less than 45 mm) blastholes, the stemming material may be soil,
sand, drill cuttings or aggregate of a size no greater than one-tenth of the blasthole
diameter.

(b) In large diameter (greater than 45 mm) blastholes, drill cuttings are often used;
however, aggregate as in Item (a), is recommended.

(c) In wet blastholes, aggregate as in Item (a) is recommended as it sinks through the
water, is self-tamping and interlocks well.

(d) Where blastholes are horizontal or are inclined upward from the collar, the stemming
material may be preformed and, where necessary, wrapped in paper and held in
position by a plug of wet clay. Alternatively, wet newspaper well tamped into the
blasthole may be used.

(e) Where the potential exists for sulphide ore dust explosions, special requirements may
apply.

(f) In reactive ground situations, it is not advisable to use drill cuttings as stemming
material.

7.5.2 Tamping rods

Tamping rods of suitable length of wood or other non-metallic material shall be used. Metal
ferrules, tips or connectors that may damage downlines or cartridges shall not be used.
Where a tamping rod is used for inserting a charge, the ends shall be kept clean and square
and the rod shall be thoroughly cleaned of any adhering grit.

7.5.3 Tamping of stemming material

Where required, stemming material shall be tamped as follows:

(a) Tamping with an appropriately made tamping tool shall be light at first, but as the
blasthole becomes filled, the tamping pressure may be increased.

(b) For top-primed blastholes, tamping shall not begin until at least 150 mm of stemming
material has been placed.

7.5.4 Precautions

Care shall be taken to ensure that the lead wires, detonating cord, signal tube or safety fuse
connected to the primer are not damaged during the placing of stemming material and
subsequent tamping.

NOTE: Safety fuses, lead wires, detonating cords or signal tube should be held firmly while the
stemming is being placed in the blasthole, to prevent them from kinking.

AS 2187.2--2006 36

7.6 BULLING

Where blastholes are to be bulled, suitable protective guarding shall be placed in front of
the collar of the blastholes to reduce the danger of fly.

NOTES:

1 Where alternative methods are available, this method of blasting is not recommended as there
is always the danger of heating in the blasthole and excess charging and prolonged excess
noise.

2 Where a bulling charge is being fired, stemming is not generally used, but if it is, it should be

water.

location shall be short-circuited while the lead wires from the detonators are being
connected. This short-circuit shall be located so that a premature explosion would be
harmless to the person opening the short-circuit. The final short-circuit shall not be
removed until the blasting area has been cleared and the final cable connection is about to
be made. The short-circuit shall be replaced immediately after the firing switch has been
opened, the firing cable removed from the power source and the firing box closed and
locked.

NOTE: The firing cable should be checked both visually and electrically for both broken circuits
and short-circuits and any damage, prior to commencing the charging.

8.2.4.2.4 Electrical connections

The following requirements for electrical connections shall be observed:

(a) Connections of lead wires to cables The lead wires shall be connected to the firing
cables with suitable connections.

(b) Connection of cables to power supply The firing cables shall not be connected to the
source of power until the blasting area has been cleared.

(c) Electrical contact Electrical contact shall not be made to the firing switch until
immediately before firing and shall be disconnected immediately afterwards and the
box locked.

(d) Re-use of firing cable The firing cable or associated wires used for firing shots at
one working place shall not be used for firing shots in another working place until all
precautions and applicable tests have been taken to ensure that such firing cables or
associated wires have no electrical connection with the leads from the first working
place.

8.2.5 Remote firing

8.2.5.1 General

The sequence for obtaining a firing output shall be able to be suspended, abandoned and
terminated at any point up to the signalling of blast, without causing the initiation of
explosives.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 42

No change to supply of power to any part or whole of the remote firing system shall cause
initiation of explosives. Such changes include, but are not limited to the following:

(a) Loss of power.

(b) Application of power.

(c) Changes or modulation (periodic changes) to any parameter of power supply (such as
voltage or current level, frequency, shape or gradient, fluid pressure, etc.).

The following applies to any part of the remote firing system leading to the firing cable or
signal tube:

(i) No fault or series of faults shall produce firing output or cause initiation of
explosives.

(ii) Any single fault shall be detected and--

(A) the system shall be put in a safe mode; and

(B) successive use of the system shall be prevented such that accumulation of faults
shall not be possible.

(ii) No failure shall cause dependent (subsequent) failures leading to initiation of
explosives.

No external interference to any part of the remote firing system leading to the firing cable
or signal tube shall produce firing output or cause initiation of explosives.

No casual connection (or loss of connection) between exposed conductors (including
momentary connection between pins on non-matching connectors) shall cause initiation of
explosives.

NOTE: The use of remote firing can create hazards specific to remote operation and increase the
risks from other hazards present in the working environment or associated with the use of
equipment and explosives. Therefore, risk assessment requires a systematic approach to cover the
full and complete field of possibilities in an exhaustive manner and to adequately treat all hazards
according to their ranking.

8.2.5.2 Equipment

The remotely operated exploder shall be fitted with effective facilities to warn of--

(a) selection of the exploder to remote form of operation; and

(b) the intention to initiate explosives with it.

NOTE: Figures 8.1 and 8.2 give schematic representations of remote firing systems.

Effectiveness of facilities shall be determined in the assessment of safety risk.

The exploder shall not produce a firing output or cause initiation of explosives when an
attempt is made to control it from controllers or sources other than by those dedicated, and
designed to do so.

All portable remote controllers and portable remote exploders shall be capable of
withstanding a free vertical fall of 1 m onto a rigid concrete surface without damage that
would otherwise cause the inadvertent initiation of explosives.

All remote controllers and remote exploders shall be capable of withstanding an impact test
of 20 J as set out in AS/NZS 4240, without damage that would otherwise cause the
inadvertent initiation of explosives.

NOTE: A locked physical barrier that prevents access to the operating mechanism and terminals
is recommended.

Marking of the remotely operated exploder should include--

(i) information that is remotely controlled; and

(ii) identification of the control unit used to operate it remotely.

Marking (display) of the remote controller should include--

(A) identification of the remotely operated exploder under control; and

(B) information about system response lag.

Remote firing equipment should only be repaired or overhauled under the supervision of a
competent person, working in an accredited/certified workshop and using relevant
documentation.

8.2.5.3 Procedures

The remotely operated exploder shall be placed in a safe position.

The firing cable or signal tube shall not be connected to the remotely operated exploder
until all personnel in the blasting area, including the shotfirer, are in a safe position.

From the remote control unit it shall not be possible to--

(a) place the exploder into a remote mode of operation; and

(b) change the exploder’s state from SAFE to ON.

These functions shall be performed only manually and at the exploder.

An assessment about the safety risk should be made prior to--

(i) commissioning and acceptance of a remote firing system for implementation; and

(ii) any changes being made to a remote firing system.

The assessment should identify the risks, estimate the likelihood and magnitude of their
consequences, produce a list of controls (equipment, procedures, actions, etc.) for treatment
(elimination, reduction, transfer, management) of the risks and nominate personnel
responsible for effective implementation of these controls.

Personnel should not be involved in the repair or use of a remote-controlled firing system
until suitably trained to a current industry competence level for the particular task.

exclusion zone, are informed of the intended blast. This system may include a
blasting siren.

(e) Where applicable, a method of informing, co-ordinating and minimizing the impacts
on the general public shall be established (e.g., road, railway or flight path
disruptions).

(f) The final warnings issued by the shotfirer before the shot is fired.

(g) Provisions for a safe place for the shotfirer to initiate the shot.

NOTE: Where an audible warning device is used, it should produce a sound that is recognizable
and clearly different from any other sound that might be used for warning or other operational
signals on the work site and sufficiently loud to give adequate warning to those likely to be
affected by the blast. A modulated frequency siren is normally suitable.

9.1 GENERAL SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

9.1.1 Blast management plan

The blast management plan should specify procedures to be implemented, which allow an
inspection of the blast area following blasting activities to determine when and if it is safe
for routine operations to continue. These procedures should include, but not necessarily be
limited to, the following:

(a) Assessment of the blast site prior to a post-blast inspection (see Clause 9.1.2).

(b) Minimum waiting time prior to conducting the post-blast inspection.

(c) Who may enter the exclusion zone prior to conducting the post-blast inspection.

(d) Prohibition of all other people from entering the exclusion zone prior to the ‘all clear’
being sounded.

(e) The meaning of the ‘all clear’.

(f) The means of sounding the ‘all clear’.

NOTE: If a siren or other communication means has been used to warn people of the blasting
activity, this warning should continue until relevant activities specified in Clause 9.3 have been
safely concluded.

9.1.2 Assessment prior to a post-blast inspection

Before proceeding to the blast site to carry out an inspection, the shotfirer or other
competent person shall make an assessment to ascertain if it is safe to do so. The
assessment shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, consideration of the following
factors:

(a) Whether fume dispersal has occurred.

(b) Whether mechanical ventilation is operating (where used).

(c) Whether dust dispersal/settlement has occurred.

(d) The identification of any apparently unstable ground.

(e) The stability of buildings and other structures.

(f) The safety and suitability of access and egress.

(g) Aspects of the blast that may indicate that not all of the charges have been initiated.

(h) In the case of a misfire, or a suspected misfire, whether the minimum waiting time
has been observed (see Section 10).

(i) The availability of a competent person to inspect for safety, ground or material that
did not move as intended.

9.2 SHIFTWORK

Where shiftwork is in progress and firing has taken place at the end of a shift, the shotfirer
shall inform the person responsible on the next shift of all applicable details of the shot.

AS 2187.2--2006 46

9.3 ELECTRIC FIRING

9.3.1 Electric firing with exploder and electronic firing

Immediately after the current has been applied to the circuit and before any person returns
to the blast site, the shotfirer shall--

(a) remove the key or handle from the exploder;

(b) disconnect the firing cable from the exploder; and

(c) short-circuit the ends of the firing cable.

NOTE: Item (c) may not be necessary for electronic firing.

In addition, the key or handle shall be retained in the possession of the shotfirer or other
competent person who will be inspecting the blast site, until the ‘all clear’ is given.

9.3.2 Mains firing

Immediately after the current has been applied to the circuit and before any person returns
to the blast site, the shotfirer shall--

(a) disconnect the power source to the firing box;

(b) disconnect the firing cable from the energy source;

(c) short-circuit the ends of the firing cable; and

(d) close and lock the firing box (or energy source).

In addition, the key or handle shall be retained in the possession of the shotfirer or other
competent person who will be inspecting the blast site, until the ‘all clear’ is given.

NOTE: When a short-circuit box is used and it is adjacent to the firing box, it should also be
locked and the key retained.

9.3.3 Remote firing

Immediately after the remote control unit has been activated to signal the exploder to
energize the circuit, and before any person returns to the blast site, the shotfirer shall--

(a) place the remote control unit in the ‘SAFE’ mode and lock the unit;

(b) after assessing the general safety considerations, and when it is assessed to be safe to
return to the exploder, disconnect the firing cable or signal tube from the exploder;
and

(c) short-circuit the ends of the firing cable.

In addition, the key or handle shall be retained in the possession of the shotfirer or other
competent person who will be inspecting the blast site, until the ‘all clear’ is given.

9.4 POST-BLAST INSPECTION

The purpose of a post-blast inspection is to ascertain if it is safe for personnel to return to
the blast site and for routine operations to resume.

The extensive variables associated with not only the type of blasting operation but also the
location of the operations would necessitate specific rather than general post-blast
procedures to be included in the blast management plan. The procedures for consideration
should include but not be limited to the following:

(a) Whether there is a need for more than one person to return to the shot for the
inspection.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

47 AS 2187.2--2006

(b) Procedures to be adopted if the inspection reveals that the ‘all clear’ into the
exclusion zone cannot be given, including the communications mechanism of the
‘all clear’ or otherwise.

(c) Determination that oxygen, fumes and dust are at acceptable levels.

(d) Continuous inspection procedures during the approach to the post-blast site that might
identify unusual or abnormal results indicating possible hazards.

(e) Whether there is a need to wash down/or scale (bar down), especially in underground
workings.

(f) Identifying a misfire or butt and the means of clearly marking misfires or butts.

9.5 SITE HOUSEKEEPING

The shotfirer shall ensure that the site is left in a safe condition after every blast.
Consideration should be given to the removal and disposal of those items that could be
mistaken by the public to indicate the presence of explosives.

10.1 DETERMINATION OF MISFIRES

To determine a misfire, the shotfirer or other competent person shall inspect the blast area.
Signs that a misfire could have occurred include, but are not limited to, the following:

(a) No detonation is observed (which implies no visual, audible or ground
movement/vibration evidence).

(b) Undisturbed ground or material is observed within the blast during the detonation or
inspection.

(c) Cut-offs.

(d) Uninitiated explosive, including explosive product, found during excavation.

(e) If, when using safety fuse, the number of shots counted is less than the number of
blastholes or groups of blastholes fired, or if there is a disagreement on the count of
shots fired, a misfire is to be assumed.

(f) If safety fuse, detonating cord, or signal tube uninitiated and protruding from is a
blasthole or butt that was intended to have been fired, that blasthole is to be treated as
a misfire.

(g) If lead wires are exposed in a portion of a blasthole that was intended to have been
fired, that blasthole is to be treated as a misfire.

(h) Unless butts or remaining portions of blastholes have been shown to be free of
explosives, they are to be treated as misfires.

(i) Identification of unexploded explosive after the ‘all clear’ has been given and site
work has recommenced.

10.2 MISFIRE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The blast management plan shall include a misfire management system, which shall provide
for the responsible and safe management of misfires. Identification of misfires may be
achieved in the following situations:

(a) Immediately after the initiation of the blast and before the post-blast inspection.

(b) During the post-blast inspection.

(c) During or after the removal or movement of blasted material.

The misfire management system shall provide for, but not be limited to, the following:

(i) Methods for locating misfire(s).

(ii) Procedures for marking and identifying misfire(s).

(iii) Procedures to establish and maintain an exclusion zone related to the misfire(s).

(iv) The introduction, removal or control of potential detonation or ignition sources.

(v) Communication/notification of the misfire(s) to relevant persons.

(vi) Procedures for misfire treatment.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

49 AS 2187.2--2006

10.3 TREATMENT OF MISFIRES

10.3.1 General

All identified misfires shall be made safe. The manner in which a particular misfire is to be
treated may vary, but an underlying approach should be established in the misfire
management system.

NOTE: Some regulatory authorities require that misfires be reported.

10.3.2 Waiting intervals

Where explosive hazards are the only hazards present, and other hazards, such as lingering
dust and fumes, are not present, the following minimum waiting shall be observed:

(a) With the exception of safety fuse initiation, the minimum waiting interval is 5 min or
such greater interval as determined in the misfire management system.

(b) Where a charge or detonator that is intended to be directly initiated by safety fuse is
identified as having failed to have been initiated, no person is to approach the misfire
until an interval of 30 min has elapsed, or such greater interval as determined in the
misfire management system.

Where other hazards are present, for example, lingering dust and fumes, a longer waiting
time may be needed.

10.3.3 Treatment

Options for the treatment of misfire(s) include, but are not limited to, the following:

(a) Refiring.

NOTES:

### 1 If lead wires are protruding from a blasthole, they should be short-circuited and coiled

into the blasthole collar until refiring procedures are implemented.

2 It may be necessary to increase the size of the exclusion zone.

3 Refiring should only be done after taking into account remaining protection systems to
minimize environmental and safety impacts.

(b) Removal of the stemming (see Clause 10.3.4) followed by repriming, re-steming and
initiation.

(c) Removal of the explosive from the blasthole(s) by flushing the blasthole with water,
or water and air, after any stemming material has been removed.

NOTE: Environmental impacts should be considered and addressed before explosive products
are flushed.

(d) Mechanical or manual removal of the explosive.

(e) Drilling, charging and initiating a new blasthole in the vicinity of the misfire(s) (see
Clause 10.3.5).

After treating the misfire(s), work shall not resume at that location until the shotfirer or
other competent person has made a thorough search for any explosive from the misfired
charge.

Recovered explosive shall be disposed of in a suitable and safe manner by a competent

person.

No person shall leave unguarded, abandon, discard or otherwise neglect to safely dispose
of, or ensure the security of, any explosive recovered in the treatment of misfires.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 50

10.3.4 Removal of stemming

Stemming may be removed by applying water under pressure, or a mixture of water and
compressed air, through a non-ferrous blowpipe or hose.

NOTES:

#### 1 Other methods may become available and these may be used once a risk assessment has been

made.

2 The use of compressed air alone is discouraged. Where it is used, special precautions should
be taken to minimize the dangers from static electricity and impact.

3 Where water under pressure or compressed air is not available, the stemming may be sludged
out by the use of water and a tamping rod.

4 During stemming removal, detonators and explosives are susceptible to accidental detonation.

5 Consideration should be given to the diameter of the blowpipe or hose in relation to the
blasthole to allow free-flow of the materials being removed. This is to ensure that there is no
excessive pressure build-up in the blasthole.

10.3.5 Firing of a new blasthole in vicinity

Where a blasthole has been previously bulled, the relieving blasthole method shall not be
used.

If it is not possible or practicable to treat the misfire(s) by the methods described in
Clause 10.3.3(a) to (d), a relieving blasthole may be drilled as parallel as possible to the
original blasthole, then charged and fired. Before any relieving blasthole is drilled it shall
be established that the drill will not contact explosives.

To complete this operation the following procedure may be effective, but will be subject to
other controls determined by risk analysis:

(a) Refer to the blast plan to identify details of the misfired blasthole(s), (e.g., depth,
deviation, orientation).

(b) To prevent drilling into a misfire, clearly mark the blasthole and effectively block the
collar of the misfired blasthole (e.g., by the insertion of a wooden plug).

(c) Drill the relieving blasthole at a distance that is sufficient to prevent any part of the
drill string from entering any part of the misfired blasthole.

NOTE: Where practicable, a remotely operated drill rig should be used to minimize the risk
of injury to persons.

With larger and longer blastholes, the distance between the misfired blasthole and the
relieving blasthole shall be increased as circumstances warrant.

11.1.1 Instigation

Explosives that are considered unsafe for normal transport, storage or use shall be
destroyed. Explosives that are surplus may be destroyed. Persons intending to dispose of
defective explosives shall seek advice from the manufacturer where it is available. Where
such advice is not available, destruction of these explosives shall be in accordance with this
Section.

NOTE: Appendix G gives information on some forms of deterioration of explosives.

11.1.2 Records

Records shall be kept of quantities and types of explosive destroyed, and the destruction
methods employed.

11.1.3 Residues

The residue from explosives destroyed by burning may be poisonous to livestock and
wildlife. It shall be buried or otherwise disposed of in accordance with applicable
environmental legislation.

11.2 METHODS OF DESTRUCTION

11.2.1 General

Explosives shall not be abandoned, thrown away, buried, discarded or placed with garbage.

Before commencing to destroy explosives, an exclusion zone shall be established and made

secure.

Destruction of explosives shall be carried out under the control of a competent person.

NOTES:

### 1 For guidance on whether to destroy explosives not mentioned in this section, the

manufacturer, supplier or the regulatory authority should be consulted.

2 Explosives that show evidence of serious exudation are likely to be unstable.

3 When serious exudation is a problem or if large quantities of explosives are to be destroyed,
the appropriate regulatory authority and the supplier of the explosives should be contacted.

11.2.2 Explosives other than detonators

11.2.2.1 General

Explosives other than detonators shall be destroyed in accordance with Clauses 11.2.2.2,
11.2.2.3 or 11.2.2.4, as applicable.

11.2.2.2 Burning

Explosives may be destroyed by burning under the control of a person competent in the
destruction of explosives.

It is possible to destroy the following types of explosives by burning:

(a) Cartridged explosives--nitroglycerine-based, watergel, and emulsion types.

(b) Cast boosters.

(c) Detonating cord.

(d) Safety fuse.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 52

(e) Igniter cord.

The following shall not be destroyed by burning:

(i) ANFO.

(ii) Ammonium nitrate.

(iii) Bulk emulsions.

(iv) Bulk watergels.

(v) Explosives contained in rigid containers other than cardboard.

NOTE: A suggested procedure for burning explosives is provided in Appendix H.

11.2.2.3 Detonation

Explosives may be destroyed by detonation, provided that a fresh priming charge is used
and no detonators are inserted into deteriorated or previously charged explosives.

Explosives shall not be detonated on ston y ground, in a shallow hole in such ground, or on
an area where debris is likely to become missiles (see Note). The extent of the spread of
such fly or flyrock will be proportional to the quantity of explosives being destroyed and
the nature of the ground and debris. These factors should be considered when determining
the exclusion zone. For this reason, explosives should be detonated in sand or earth free
from stones.

NOTE: Missile damage can be expected over an extensive distance.

11.2.2.4 Dissolving in water

Small quantities of water-soluble explosives (e.g., ANFO) may be destroyed by immersion
in buckets or drums of water. Alternatively, water-soluble explosives may be spread on the
ground and watered in.

11.2.3 Detonators

Small quantities of detonators may be destroyed by one of the following methods:

(a) Detonation Detonators may be destroyed by detonation by either placing them in a
hole with a suitable primer above and in contact with them, or by taping them to a
primer or a length of detonating cord.

(b) Burning Detonators may be destroyed by burning in a furnace specially designed
and constructed for the purpose.

NOTE: Some regulatory authorities require furnaces to be approved.

Where there is serious deterioration of detonators or large quantities of detonators need to
be destroyed, the regulatory authority and the supplier shall be contacted.

11.2.4 Other explosives

For methods of destroying explosives not mentioned above, the manufacturer shall be
consulted.

12.1.1 General

Where electric detonators are used to initiate explosive charges, they shall be used at such
distances from sources of electromagnetic radiation that a substantial factor of safety is
provided against the possibility of induced ignition of the detonators from such sources.

NOTES:

### 1 Additional information and guidance on extraneous electricity is provided in Appendix I.

Table I1 sets out recommendations for minimum distances from sources of radio frequency
radiation.

2 Electrical detonator leads should be short-circuited by twisting together the bared ends, until
immediately prior to use.

12.1.2 Atmospheric electrical activity

If there is evidence of any form of atmospheric electrical activity or disturbance, on-site
manufacturing operations, and surface and shallow underground blasting operations shall be
suspended. Such operations shall not be resumed until the electrical disturbance has passed.

12.1.3 Direct contact with electrical conductors

Where firing cables or wires are used in the vicinity of electrical power, communications or
lighting cables, adequate precautions shall be taken to prevent any firing cables or wires
from coming into contact with such conductors before, during, or after firing.

12.1.4 Induced currents and stray currents

Adequate precautions shall be taken to prevent premature detonation due to capacitive and
inductive coupling from high voltage lines, and from stray currents.

NOTE: As a guide, electric firing should not be used within 100 m of power lines with voltages in
excess of 20 000 V.

12.1.5 Static electricity

Adequate precautions shall be taken to prevent premature explosion due to the build-up of
static electrical charges. The following situations can contribute to this phenomenon:

(a) Loading explosives in dust storms and snowstorms.

(b) Moving conveyor belts.

(c) Pneumatic loading of free-flowing granular explosives or sand stemming into
blastholes.

(d) Pouring free-flowing granular explosives into paper or plastic cartridges or blasthole
liners.

(e) Low humidity or freezing conditions.

NOTE: Additional information on hazards due to static electricity are provided in Paragraph I5,

12.2 GROUND VIBRATION AND AIRBLAST OVERPRESSURE

Where blasting is carried out in proximity to buildings or structures, ground vibration and
airblast overpressure shall be kept within limits related to the probability of damage and
human discomfort.

NOTE: Recommended maximum levels for ground vibration and airblast overpressure are
provided in Appendix J, together with additional information and guidance.

12.3 FLY

Where protection from the possibility of fly is necessary, blasting mats or other suitable
controls shall be used.

Unconfined plaster or blister shots shall be permitted only where drilling of the rock to be
blasted or other methods of fragmenting the rock are impracticable. Noise levels from all
types of blasting will have to comply with the requirements of the appropriate regulatory
authority.

NOTE: Guidance on the causes and prevention of fly is provided in Appendix E.

12.4 BLASTING UNDER WATER

12.4.1 Precautions

For blasting under water, no blast shall be fired when any person is in the water in the
vicinity of the operations. Additional care shall be taken in waters such as estuaries or near
beaches as the pressure pulse effects are more pronounced in water less than 10 m deep.

NOTE: Attention is drawn to the fact that blasting may not take place underwater without the
permission of the appropriate regulatory authority.

Concussive effects and exclusion zones may be estimated for unconfined charges from the
following equation:

1/ 3
3 m

P = 55 ×10 . . . 12.4.1
R

where

P = peak pressure, in kilopascals

m = mass of explosives, in kilograms

R = distance from charge to point affected by pressure, in metres

For confined blasthole charges underwater (P c ) (confined charge) may be estimated as
0.4 times the peak pressure. It is recommended that confirmation of such estimates be
sought by monitoring a test shot(s) or other suitable means.

The recommended maximum peak pressure for human and animal exposure to underwater
blasting is 40 kPa. Peak pressures in excess of 40 kPa can cause serious injury or death.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

55 AS 2187.2--2006

12.4.2 Detonators

Standard electric or electronic detonators with plastic-coated wire shall not be used at
depths exceeding 30 m unless specified by the manufacturer or supplier.

NOTES:

#### 1 Submarine, electric or special delay detonators should be used at depths greater than 30 m.

2 Detonating cord initiated by an electric detonator may be used but safety fuse should not be
used underwater.

3 Water-resistant explosives, which would be expected to remain unaffected by a 24 h
immersion but would be rendered inert by a larger period of immersion, may provide for
greater safety. Care should be exercised in the location of detonators to avoid misfires and to
facilitate recovery in the event of a misfire. Cast boosters should be avoided unless the
explosive is booster sensitive at the depth and temperature of water in which the explosive is
to be detonated.

12.4.3 Junctions

Joints shall be made before the cable is lowered. Joints in wires leading to detonators shall
be thoroughly waterproofed such as by wrapping with insulating tape and treating with a
sealing compound, care being taken to ensure that all joints have sufficient mechanical
strength for the purpose for which they are intended.

12.4.4 Exploder key or handle

The means of operating the exploder shall remain in the possession of the person placing
the charge while that person is submerged. In addition, live electrical equipment in the
immediate vicinity of the exploder and firing cable shall be adequately isolated.

12.5 USE OF EXPLOSIVES IN AN ATMOSPHERE GREATER THAN

ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE

12.5.1 General

The use of explosives in an atmosphere greater than normal atmospheric pressure, created
for the purpose of preventing inflows, presents a number of issues that would not normally
be experienced in general use and need to be considered. Such issues include the following:

(a) The mass of oxygen per cubic metre in the air is greater.

(b) If the breathing medium being used by the workers has a percentage of oxygen
greater than 21%, the mass referred to in Item (a) is even higher.

NOTE: This increased oxygen level is sometimes used to increase the working time of a
worker without the need for decompression.

(c) The volatility of flammable/explosive gases and other flammable materials is
increased proportional to the increased working pressure and oxygen content. Gases
may not be released until or during initiation of a shot.

12.5.2 Storage

Explosives and detonators shall not be stored in an atmosphere greater than atmospheric
pressure (see Clause 12.5.1).

12.5.3 Transport into working chamber

Explosives and detonators shall be taken into the working chamber in a receptacle that is
suitable and safe for its intended purpose.

Only those persons required to transport the explosives into a chamber shall be allowed into
an airlock. No other material or equipment shall be simultaneously taken into the working
chamber with the explosives.

NOTE: Both explosives and detonators may be transported in the same container, provided that
there is a division between the compartments and the lead wires are effectively short-circuited.

12.5.4 Method of initiation

12.5.4.1 Explosives and initiation systems

When deciding which explosives and initiation systems are to be used, the following
criteria apply:

(a) Pilot drilling ahead and testing for flammable gases shall be considered.

(b) Deflagrating explosives or safety fuse initiation systems that incorporate deflagrating
explosives shall not be used.

(c) The initiation system shall be able to be initiated from outside the compressed (air)
environment.

(d) Explosives shall be suitable and safe for use in this environment. Manufacturer’s
recommendations should be sought.

(e) Consideration shall be given to the use of permitted explosives and detonators in
strata that is likely to contain flammable gas irrespective of whether or not flammable
gases are detected.

12.5.4.2 Electrical firing

Where charges are to be fired electrically, and where pumps and lights are in use, there
shall be no cables or power within 30 m of the face being charged, and only lamps with a
completely insulated power source shall be used, e.g., miner’s cap-lamps.

12.5.5 Testing of electric detonators

Each electric detonator to be used shall be tested for continuity and resistance outside the
working chamber.

The completed circuit and the firing cable shall also be tested from outside the working
chamber.

NOTES:

#### 1 See Appendix F for a suitable test method.

2 Electric detonators must not be confused with electronic detonators.

12.5.6 Effect of increased gas pressures on structural integrity

Initiating explosives generate huge volumes of gases in a negligible space of time and this
increases pressures accordingly. Engineering detail should be sought as to the capability of
bulkheads, relief valves and other analogous fixtures forming the seal(s) of the compressed
air section to withstand the increased pressures that are generated by the initiated
explosives. A maximum weight (not MIC) of explosive may need to be imposed and strictly
enforced.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

57 AS 2187.2--2006

12.5.7 Firing, before and after

12.5.7.1 Personnel to be withdrawn

When charging is completed within the working chamber, all personnel shall move to safety
prior to the detonation of the blast.

Blasts shall be initiated from outside the working chamber.

NOTES:

#### 1 Before exploding a charge in a working chamber of a caisson, air should be blowing freely

past the cutting edge where possible.

2 Where two or more shafts or tunnels are being excavated, either adjacent or towards each
other (such as in small ‘pot and drive’ tunnelling operations), and the two crews are not in
direct visual contact with each other, then the adjacent excavation crew should leave their
excavation and retire to a safe place prior to the face-charging crew commencing charging the
face, and they should not return to their own excavation until firing has been completed and
the ‘all clear’ given.

12.5.7.2 Airflow

On detonation of the blast, air shall be exhausted from as near the face as possible to ensure
that hazardous products generated from the blast are reduced to safe levels before any
persons are allowed re-entry. At the same time, the rate of admission of air to the working
chamber shall be increased so that an air velocity of not less than 7 m/min is maintained
through the working chamber. The air pressure in the working chamber shall not be
permitted to rise during the period of increased admission; to prevent this, additional air
shall be exhausted from the chamber.

12.5.7.3 Precautions before re-entry

Before personnel are re-admitted to the working chamber after blasting, the recorder of the
automatic monitoring system, or the quality of the atmosphere issuing from the outlet main
from the working chamber, shall be checked to determine that the atmosphere has reached a
fit state for entry.

12.6 BLASTING IN HOT MATERIAL

12.6.1 General

Material shall be defined as hot if its temperature is 55°C or more but less than 100°C.

If there is a possibility that the material is oxidizing or reactive, as is occasionally the case
with some sulphide minerals, additional precautions shall be taken (see Clause 12.9).

12.6.2 Temperature measurement

An instrument suitable for measuring in the specified temperature range shall be used and
the instrument shall be placed in the blasthole for a sufficient length of time to give a stable
reading.

Blastholes that break through shall be sealed for 4 h prior to reading the temperature.

When hot material is indicated in any blasthole, the temperature of all the blastholes in the
material to be blasted shall be measured within 24 h of the beginning of the shift in which
charging commences.

In the particular case of mining at depth with a known temperature gradient or geothermal
gradient, the following apply:

(a) Temperature measurements shall be taken where blasthole temperatures are expected
to exceed 55°C as determined from the temperature gradient or geothermal gradient
for the immediate locality.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 58

(b) The temperature of development decline faces shall be determined by measurements
taken in holes located within 10 m of the face once per week. The holes shall have the
same length as those in the face to be blasted. A sufficient number of holes shall be
selected to enable all geological rock types to be represented.

(c) The temperature in each decline face shall be compared to the expected temperature
for the particular elevation and, if a variation of greater than 3°C occurs,
measurements shall be made on a daily basis on that face.

(d) The nominal temperature used for any particular vertical section of a stope blast shall
be the highest temperature expected in that section from the temperature gradient.

NOTE: A period of 2 h should elapse between the drilling of the hole and temperature
measurement due to the cooling effect of the flushing water and air.

12.6.3 Types of explosives

12.6.3.1 Time limits

The following limits apply to the use of explosives for blasting in hot material:

(a) Explosives having a nitroglycerine base shall not be used.

(b) ANFO may be used without restriction in hot material, provided that the possibility of
oil loss is taken into account.

NOTE: At high temperatures, ANFO made with low aromatic oils tends to have a lower oil
loss than ANFO made with fuel oil.

(c) The manufacturer’s recommendations for suitable temperature limits for water-gel,
emulsion and other types of explosives shall be followed.

12.6.3.2 Charging

The time between the charging and the firing of a blast shall leave sufficient margin to
assure reliable function of the initiation system and complete detonation of the explosive.

As the effect of heat on safety fuse is adverse, safety fuse shall not be used in hot material
blasting.

NOTES:

#### 1 Electric detonators to be used should preferably be fitted with polypropylene insulated lead

wires as this insulation will withstand greater heat without softening.

2 Connections with detonating cord should be made not less than 300 mm from the free ends of
the cord.

3 The effect of heat on signal tube is to make fuel oil penetration more rapid. The sleep time of
the signal tube to be used should be sought from the manufacturer.

12.6.4 Misfires

Misfires shall be dealt with immediately they are located using the procedure described in
Section 10.

NOTE: The working place should be ‘mucked out’ and the face examined within one working
shift of the firing of that face.

12.7 HIGH TEMPERATURE BLASTING

High temperature blasting is defined as the blasting of materials at 100°C or greater. Where
high temperature blasting is to be used, advice shall be sought from a specialist in this area.
Such blasting shall be carried out by a specialist in this area.

When using explosives under high temperature blasting conditions, it is necessary to adopt
special precautions. Hence, each shot shall be planned in detail so that it is made with
deftness, speed and safety.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

59 AS 2187.2--2006

12.8 DEMOLITION

If explosives are to be used for demolition purposes, contact should be made with the
appropriate authorities well in advance of the intended date of firing.

For demolition involving structures, or components of a structure, the requirements of
AS 2601 shall be complied with.

NOTE: For guidance on demolition of structures, see Appendix K.

12.9 BLASTING IN OXIDIZING GROUND

In oxidizing or reactive ground, sheathing of ANFO explosives or other measures to inhibit
exothermic reactions between the explosives and the material to be blasted may be

necessary.

In the case of oxidizing or reactive ground, the explosives to be used and the charging
practices to be adopted shall be developed in conjunction with explosives manufacturers,
explosives consultants, or other expert authorities using the risk management process.

NOTES:

### 1 Reactive ground is often associated with sulphide ores, especially iron-containing sulphides.

2 Reactive ground can be encountered at ambient temperatures.

3 Oxidization is often indicated by very low groundwater pH and by rapidly increasing
borehole temperature soon after drilling.

12.10 LASER HAZARDS

Attention is drawn to the possible hazards associated with higher output lasers that may be
used in some mining and construction operations. While the possibility of initiation of
explosives is low, the danger to the explosives operator may be more significant.

NOTE: Further guidance can be found in AS/NZS 2211 (all parts as applicable) and AS 2397.

EQUIPMENT FOR ELECTRICAL FIRING

(Normative)

B1 GENERAL

Clause 2.5 requires that equipment used for testing and firing electric detonators shall
comply with the requirements of this Appendix and that, where appropriate, compliance be
verified by testing in accordance with the test methods specified herein.

The specification for circuit testers, exploders and firing cables set out in Paragraphs B4,
B5, B6 and B7 apply only to equipment used to fire detonators that have no-fire currents in
the range 180 mA to 250 mA.

NOTES:

1 Group 1 detonators have a bridge resistance of 0.9 Ω to 1.6 Ω.

2 The requirements for other types of equipment would normally be set by the regulatory
authority.

3 For detonators other than Group 1, the specification for circuit testers, exploders and firing
cables should be determined accordingly.

B2 APPROVAL OF EQUIPMENT

In general, exploders and circuit testers will require approval. Equipment shall comply with
the following requirements:

(a) The equipment shall pass such tests as the regulatory authority considers necessary to
establish their qualities and, in particular, their safety (see Note 1).

(b) The equipment shall comply with any construction and performance requirements
specified by the regulatory authority.

(c) The equipment shall be durable, robust, functionally reliable and suitable for use in

−
ambient temperatures normally found in Australia ( 5°C to 45°C).

(d) Any enclosing case shall be constructed to prevent the ingress of dust or splashed
liquids, as far as is reasonably practicable.

(e) For exploders and circuit testers, the insulation resistance between the circuit and the
case shall be greater than 50 MΩ at 500 V when measured after conditioning for 24 h
in an ambient temperature of maximum 20°C and relative humidity of at least 90%.

NOTES:

1 Certification to other national or international Codes or Standards may be acceptable.

2 Exploders and circuit testers are electrical instruments and should be accorded the care in
handling and use appropriate to such instruments.

B3 CARE OF EQUIPMENT

All equipment shall be maintained in good and efficient condition.

B4 CIRCUIT TESTER

The circuit tester shall be a special type of ohmmeter, manufactured so that under any
operating conditions it will deliver less than 50 mA when short-circuited.

NOTE: The use of a battery with an output limited to 50 mA is recommended. The scale of the
instrument should be graduated to give clear readings from 0.5 Ω upward and for convenience the
scale may be divided into two or more ranges.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 64

Any adjustment or replacement of batteries in circuit testers shall be done either by the
manufacturer or strictly in accordance with instructions issued by the manufacturer.

The circuit tester shall be reliable in performance and be accurate to within ±0.5 Ω or
within 7% of true resistance value, whichever is the greater.

B5 EXPLODER

B5.1 Maintenance

The maintenance of exploders shall be carried out by a competent person. For mechanically
operated exploders, the moving parts shall be lightly lubricated, care being taken to prevent
excess oil spreading to the commutator and brushes.

NOTE: The interior of the exploders should be kept free from dust and the exterior should be
clean and dry. The terminals should be kept clean.

B5.2 Routine testing

The exploder shall be tested by means of the rheostat described in Paragraph B6 or by an
alternative means provided by the exploder manufacturer.

Where the rheostat method is used, the rheostat shall be constructed to the specifications of
Paragraph B6, together with two detonators, and connected in series across the exploder
firing terminals. Both detonators shall be shielded separately, so that one will not initiate
the other, and no injury can result to any person in the vicinity. The rheostat shall be set for
a rated capacity one unit less than the rated capacity of the exploder. The exploder shall be
operated according to prescribed instructions. Both detonators shall fire.

B5.3 Construction

In addition to the general requirements set out in Paragraph B2, the construction of the
exploder shall comply with the following:

(a) The exploder shall be provided with a protective case incorporating carrying straps or
handles.

(b) The output terminals or connecting arrangements shall be designed and sized so as to
allow convenient and secure attachment of firing cables of the size specified in
Paragraph B7.

(c) The exploder shall be so constructed that it can only be made operable by a
removable handle or key, and it shall only be possible to remove this handle or key in
the ‘off’ or ‘safe’ position.

The following types of exploders are available:

(i) Generator type Generator type exploders have a dynamo, the armature of
which is manually rotated through gearing from either a plunger rack-bar or a
twisting handle. They are normally used for series firing.

(ii) Capacitor type Capacitor-type exploders have one or more capacitors that are
charged from either a battery or a dynamo having a manually rotated armature.
Capacitor-type exploders are suitable for series firing, and most may be used to
a limited extent for firing series-in-parallel circuits.

Capacitor exploders are fitted with a device to indicate when sufficient
electrical energy is available to fire the circuit of detonators.

A special variant of capacitor type exploders embodies several capacitors, each
of which is used to fire one circuit of detonators. Internal timing controls allow
the capacitors to discharge into their detonator circuits at predetermined time
intervals thus providing sequential firing.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

65 AS 2187.2--2006

(iii) Sequential or sequence switch type The sequential or sequence-switch-type
exploders provide delay firing intervals of predetermined duration. A manually
or mechanically rotated sequence switch directs electrical energy to fire each
detonator/circuit in turn as the rotating arm passes over the appropriate contact.

B5.4 Labelling

The exploder shall be labelled as follows:

(a) Instructions for use A permanent label of instructions shall be secured to the
exploder by screws, rivets or other permanent means.

NOTE: The instructions should be visible during use.

(b) Removal of key A prominent label shall be fixed to the front face of the exploder,
readily seen when inserting the key with the exploder in or out of its protective case,
bearing the words ‘ REMOVE KEY AFTER FIRING ’ or ‘ REMOVE HANDLE AFTER
FIRING ’, as appropriate.

(c) Capacity The capacity, expressed in terms of the maximum number of defined
detonators or the maximum series circuit resistance that can be fired by the exploder,
shall be marked on the exploder.

(d) Battery The type of battery required.

NOTE: Leak-proof batteries are recommended.

B5.5 Electrical design features

B5.5.1 Firing output

The exploder shall be capable of producing an output current only with the firing
mechanism in one definite firing position. With a connected resistance of 2.1(n + 1) Ω,
where n is the rated capacity of the exploder for any single operation of the firing, the
output current shall be as follows:

(a) For a constant output exploder ........................................................1.4 A for 3.5 ms.

(b) For a capacitance exploder ....................................................... not less than 8 mJ/Ω.

Once a firing output has been produced, the firing controls shall be returned to the ‘off’ or
‘safe’ position or otherwise cancelled before another firing output can be produced.

B5.5.2 Abortion of firing

The sequence for obtaining a firing output shall be able to be abandoned at any point up to
the final firing position without producing an output current.

B5.5.3 Component malfunction

The design of the exploder shall be such that a firing output shall not be produced through
component malfunction. For the purpose of this Paragraph, ‘malfunction’ shall include
mechanical and electrical failure of a switch, an earth fault on any part of the equipment,
and an open-circuit or short-circuit occurring on any component or any part of the electrical
circuit.

NOTE: It is recommended that at least two components would need to malfunction before an
unintentional firing output is produced.

B5.5.4 Generator-driven exploders

For exploders whose output is directly provided from a generator, suitable means shall be
provided to ensure that current is not put to line until the firing output required by
Paragraph B5.5.1 is available.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 66

B5.5.5 Exploders of the capacitor-discharge type

For exploders of the capacitor-discharge type, the following requirements apply:

(a) Where the firing circuit is made automatically, no current shall be put to line until the
capacitor is adequately charged and the firing output required by Paragraph B5.5.1 is
available.

(b) Where the firing circuit is made by a manually operated switch, an indication shall be
given when, and only when, the capacitor is adequately charged.

(c) When the removable handle or key is removed (see Paragraph B5.3(c))--

(i) the capacitor shall automatically be discharged over a period of not more than
3 s (see Note); and

(ii) the firing terminals shall be short-circuited.

NOTE: A resistor is normally used, as discharging a capacitor by means of a direct shortcircuit can damage the capacitor and result in a reduction in capacity of the exploder.

(d) When there is no external circuit connected, adequate provision shall be made to
discharge the exploder over a period of not more than 3 s.

NOTE: A bleed resistance comprising two resistors of adequate rating connected in parallel
across the output terminals can be used.

(e) In the ‘off’ or ‘safe’ position, any battery used in the exploder shall be electrically
disconnected from the capacitor.

B6 RHEOSTAT

Where a rheostat is used for testing exploders (see Paragraph B5.2), it shall consist of a
suitable variable resistance fitted with stepped contacts or a number of resistances
connected to terminals. This may be calibrated in terms of a convenient number of
detonators, each contact being clearly marked with the proper number of detonators
represented by the contact.

For the purpose of calculating the resistance required between steps, and allowing a factor
of safety, 3.2 Ω shall be considered as the resistance for each detonator in the circuit.

B7 FIRING CABLE

Firing cable for use with portable-type exploders, except sequential exploders, shall comply
with AS/NZS 3191 and shall be of two-core flexible cord, thermoplastic insulated and
sheathed. The cores shall be multi-stranded copper conductors having a minimum crosssectional area and maximum resistance as follows:

(a) Heavy duty............................................ 2.0 mm [2], not more than 2 Ω/100 m of cable.

(b) General duty.......................................... 1.0 mm [2], not more than 5 Ω/100 m of cable.

The cable shall be maintained in a sound condition, care being taken to avoid kinks, cuts
and abrasions.

NOTE: A suitable type of heavy-duty cable is 50/0.25 mm, preferably yellow in colour.

FIRE PRECAUTIONS

(Informative)

C1 GENERAL

If a fire occurs and explosives may be at risk, personnel should be aware of the possibility
of an explosion and should take suitable precautions.

The fire and explosion hazards of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate mixtures are
different, as the latter should be regarded as an explosive.

After extinguishing the fire, the residue should be disposed of in accordance with the
requirements of the regulatory authority.

WARNING: THE FUMES PRODUCED BY THE BURNING OF AMMONIUM

NITRATE OR EXPLOSIVES ARE TOXIC.

C2 AMMONIUM NITRATE

Limited-area fires, even in large quantities of ammonium nitrate, can be fought with
copious quantities of water. It is important that the mass be kept cool. As much ventilation
as possible should be provided to the fire area, to dissipate the products of decomposition
and the heat of reaction.

In massive fires, an explosion hazard exists and firefighting should be abandoned unless
large volumes of water can be applied by remote control.

Water acts only as a cooling agent. Ammonium nitrate, an oxidizing material, does not need
atmospheric oxygen for reaction. Consequently, fires cannot be smothered and chemical
extinguishing agents are ineffective.

C3 EXPLOSIVES

When explosives are threatened by fire, they should be removed only if this can be done
promptly and safely. All loaded explosive trucks and trucks containing raw materials used
in the mixing of explosives may be removed from an area if this procedure can be carried
out promptly and safely. If this is not possible because the involvement of explosives is
imminent, the area should be evacuated in anticipation of an explosion and containment of
the blaze should only be attempted with copious quantities of water if remote control means
are available.

APPENDIX D

PREPARATION OF PRIMERS

(Informative)

D1 PRIMING

Typical methods of preparing primers are shown in Figure D1.

D2 METHODS

When using detonating cord with trunk and branch lines, the following recommendations
should be observed:

(a) A detonating cord of sufficient strength to reliably initiate the explosive product
should be selected.

(b) The cord should be cut from the roll at the top of the blasthole to leave an excess of
about 0.5 m or greater protruding for later attachment of the trunkline or detonator.

(c) Connections between trunk and branches and between detonators and detonating cord
should be made as shown in Appendix F.

(d) Sealing tubes or tape, or other sealing compound (or both) should be used on all
joints or open ends of detonating cord where protection is required from weather or

water.

(e) Whenever there is a change of direction in trunk or branch lines, the radius of bend in
the cord should be not less than 75 mm.

(f) All detonating cord lines should be sufficiently taut to prevent formation of loops but
sufficient slack should be left in branch lines to allow for possible subsidence of
materials in the blastholes.

(g) It is also desirable to initiate the detonating cord in such a manner that two detonating
paths to each blasthole are available.

When using detonators to prepare primers, the manufacturer’s recommendations should be
followed.

APPENDIX E

FLYROCK AND FLY

(Informative)

E1 INTRODUCTION

Because the potential for severe injury or property damage exists, precautions against
flyrock and fly should be foremost in the mind of any shotfirer. The closer to persons or
property that blasting is carried out, the greater should be the awareness, care and degree of
protection exercised in avoiding flyrock and fly incidents.

Paragraphs E1 to E3.7 mainly address the projection of rock and not debris or other
material in general. However, debris that may be on, near, or around a shot may become fly
and many of the principles used in the control of flyrock can be adopted to control fly.
Flyrock and fly occurs when explosive energy in the form of gas expansion energy is vented
violently into the atmosphere and projects rocks and/or debris outward and away from the
blast area. Fly generated as such represents a serious problem for users of explosives, who
must ensure the safety of persons, equipment, and property in the area surrounding the
blast.

A number of incidents have been recorded where persons have been killed or injured as a
direct result of fly from blasts. An even greater number of instances report property damage
and near misses.

E2 FLYROCK FORMATION

E2.1 Contributing factors

Many factors contribute to the occurrence of flyrock. These include--

(a) weak rock structure;

(b) insufficient front row blasthole burdens;

(c) stemming depth;

(d) initiation sequence;

(e) blasthole diameter;

(f) blast pattern shape; or

(g) stemming material.

These factors are considered in Paragraphs E2.2 and E2.7.

E2.2 Weak rock structure

Where explosive charges intersect or are in close proximity to major geological faults or
zones of weakness, the high pressure gases formed upon initiation of the explosive column
seek out and preferentially jet along these paths of lower resistance, resulting in a
concentration of gas expansion energy. Ideally this energy is required for rock
fragmentation and heave but, in this instance, it is dissipated as noise, airblast overpressure
and flyrock.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

71 AS 2187.2--2006

E2.3 Front row blasthole burdens

Destructive flyrock can be ejected from front row blastholes where insufficient rock burden
exists between the explosive charge and the free surface. This can occur near the collar
region (see Figure E1(a)) or near the toe where the face has been undercut or where
excessive blasthole deviation has occurred (see Figure E1(b)).

E2.4 Stemming depth

The stemming region of a blast block usually incorporates a zone of rock that has been
weakened by surface weathering, or previously fractured due to subgrade blasting from the
bench above. In this region, blast gases easily jet into and propagate cracks to the free
surface. As the stemming depth decreases (see Figure E2), a larger proportion of blast gases
are available for premature ejection resulting in an increase of observable flyrock. As a
conservative guideline, the depth of stemming should be equal to or greater than the burden.

FIGURE E1 FRONT ROW BLASTHOLE BURDENS

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 72

E2.5 Initiation sequence

In rock breakage, optimum fragmentation and muckpile looseness is achieved when the
principal rock movement is forward. This progressive relief of burden is achieved by
peeling the blastholes away from the blast block with the use of inter-row delays. If these
inter-row delays are not used or are not adequate for a given blast design, then each
explosive charge will crater to the upper horizontal plane as this offers the least path of
resistance for the escaping high pressure blasthole gases. These gases will create flyrock as
shown in Figure E2. When blastholes are initiated out of sequence (e.g., back row before
front row), a similar effect occurs, with consequential flyrock.

E2.6 Blasthole diameter

When a blasthole is increased in diameter, the linear charge-weight of fully coupled
explosives increases by the square of the ratio of the diameters. This means that when
changing from a 100 mm to a 200 mm diameter blasthole, the explosive weight per metre
has increased by a factor of four. If a change in explosive charge distribution (particularly
collar height) is not made when increasing the blasthole diameter, the increase in explosive
energy in the presence of major geological faults, inadequate burdens or poor stemming
may produce catastrophic flyrock.

FIGURE E2 FLYROCK GENERATION DUE TO STEMMING DEPTH REDUCTION

E2.7 Stemming material

Poor stemming or a total lack of stemming will result in flyrock. Stemming acts as a plug to
trap blast-generated gases in the blasthole where they will do useful work in fragmenting
and heaving the rock mass. If this stemming is inefficient or is absent, blast gases will
stream up the blasthole along the path of least resistance resulting in ejection of the collar
rock as harmful flyrock. Should the stemming column contain individual rocks that are of
disproportionate size to the blasthole diameter, it is possible for these rocks to be shot in
missile fashion over long distances and consequently constitute a potential flyrock hazard.

E3 FLYROCK CONTROL

E3.1 General

The rapidly expanding gases resulting from the initiation of explosives create high
pressures, which have to be relieved in a controlled manner. These high-pressure gases will
tend to expand in directions that offer the least resistance, such as free faces and areas of
weak rock structure. By correctly structuring blast designs and by skilfully and carefully
drilling and loading the blast, flyrock formation can be controlled to acceptable levels.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

73 AS 2187.2--2006

When drilling and shooting in broken or weathered rock, difficulties will be experienced.
Drilling will be difficult, as the air will be distributed throughout the cracks and fissures
preventing sufficient pressure to build up in the blasthole for cuttings to be efficiently
flushed out. Shotfirers should always confer with the driller or examine drill logs before
loading any shot.

Control of flyrock can be difficult where the free face is horizontal, such as the initial
blastholes in a pit, trench, or shallow road cutting blasts (see Figure E3).

The probability of flyrock can be reduced by drilling through overburden and using it as
cover, rather than removing it before drilling and blasting.

Danger from the upward throw of rock should be controlled by such means as blasting mats
(plus backfill cover if necessary) or by ensuring that adequate distances exist to locations
requiring protection from flyrock.

A good starting point is to ensure that stemming height is either--

(a) equal to or greater than the burden; or

(b) 25 times the blasthole diameter.

This may be varied once sufficient site experience is gained.

Where vertical free faces exist, such as in a quarry, rock throw will be substantially
horizontal away from the free face (see Figure E4).

FIGURE E3 HORIZONTAL FREE FACE

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 74

FIGURE E4 VERTICAL OR NEAR VERTICAL FREE FACE

If the free face is underburdened or contains areas of weak rock structure, flyrock danger
will be increased (see Figure E5).

Concentrated charges cause problems due to loose poured explosives filling enlarged
sections of blasthole, which tend to occur in areas of weak rock structure.

When loading a blasthole in broken rock, a shotfirer should be aware of the quantity of
explosives being placed in the blasthole, especially when using ANFO or other bulk
explosives. These types of explosives readily fill any voids and cracks, thus allowing much
larger quantities in the blasthole with the same depth of stemming. This can lead to
destructive flyrock and excessive airblast overpressure. Packaged explosives are
recommended when this problem is encountered.

In many cases, when blasting in broken rock, the shot will be rather ineffective as the gases
formed from the initiated explosives will dissipate into the cracks and voids. In all blasting,
adequate experience and local knowledge should be used.

E3.2 Examination of blast site and surveying of blast faces and blastholes

The area surrounding the blast site should be inspected to determine distances to protected
works, e.g., residences, roads, public places, dangerous goods storage, and due
consideration should be taken in determining the degree of protection necessary. Previous
excavations can give significant information about the rock structure.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

75 AS 2187.2--2006

FIGURE E5 UNDERBURDENED OR WEAKENED FREE FACE

It is important that blast faces be accurately surveyed prior to marking out blastholes and
before loading them with explosives. This is necessary to control flyrock and to comply
with regulatory authority blast vibration limits.

There are a number of methods available for face surveying and for relating the actual
blasthole drilled to the face. They vary from basic ‘low-tech’ methods to the latest
electronic devices, but few, if any, are the complete answer. All methods have shortcomings
and varying amounts of interpretation by the shotfirer are required to overcome practical
problems such as the face not being fully exposed and lack of clear definition of toe and
brow location.

All faces should be carefully inspected by standing in front of the face. This visual
examination must be supplemented by an accurate survey to prevent problems such as
excessive airblast overpressure and flyrock from underburdening, or excessive ground
vibration and poor fragmentation from overburdening. Blastholes may be inclined and
positioned so that they have equal burden over their total length (see Figure E6).

FIGURE E6 DESIGN BURDEN ATTAINED WITH THE USE OF ANGLED BLASTHOLES

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 76

The task of positioning and inclining blastholes to suit a particular face geometry can be
reviewed for each front row blasthole drilled when the preceding blasted ground has been
cleaned out. This represents the optimum situation and should be encouraged whenever
possible.

NOTE: Large surface mining operations, which have a continuous drilling, blasting and loading
cycle, in which material broken by a previous blast remains lying against the face when the next
blast is fired, should use an alternative technique. In this case, the collar distance, as measured
from observable back cracking from the previous blast and the blasthole inclination, should be
determined following a detailed evaluation of blast records.

E3.3 Charge configuration and loading procedure

The amount and location of charge within a blasthole has the most significant effect upon
the generation of flyrock. A number of factors including prominent geological structure,
bench face geometry and rock strength need to be considered when evaluating the charge to
be placed into a blasthole. Usually, the upper sections of front row vertical blastholes
warrant less charge than subsequent rows to account for bench face irregularities and
reduced burdens.

When prominent geological structures or lower strength rocks are encountered as bands
either intersecting or closely located to the blasthole, deck charging or light loading
techniques should be used to reduce the concentration of charge located directly adjacent to
these planes of weakness.

The correct charge weight should be employed in the blasthole. When using ANFO or any
other free-running explosive, pour measured quantities of the explosives into the blasthole
and monitor the build-up of the explosive column by tape measure or wooden pole. This is
to avoid overcharging which may result from fissures or chambers in the rock.

When planning and loading a blast, the amount of explosives used should be checked by
dividing the weight of explosives used by the solid volume of material to be blasted. This
ratio is called the loading (or powder) factor, and is commonly expressed as kilograms of
explosives per cubic metre (solid) of material blasted. Secondary blasting (if permitted)
requires a very low loading (or powder) factor, and special care should be taken to avoid
overcharging when carrying out secondary blasting.

It is emphasized that all blasting personnel be adequately trained and supervised and that
adequate blast charging supervision is required to ensure that loading and initiating
procedures minimize the possibility of harmful ejection of flyrock during blasting
operations.

E3.4 Stemming medium

Stemming is required to trap blast gases in the blasthole so that they will be utilized in
effective heaving and fragmenting of the rock mass. Poor stemming or a total lack of it will
result in flyrock. Visual observations and photographic records have shown that blastholes
stemmed with fine drill cuttings usually show a pronounced degree of rifling and flyrock.
Odd sized or rounded rocks in the blasthole can also become projectiles in the same

manner.

An alternative stemming material that overcomes the problems associated with fine drill
cuttings is crushed angular rock. This stemming material has many desirable features
including--

(a) the ability to interlock together;

(b) the ability to wedge against the side of the blasthole wall thus providing increased
resistance to premature ejection; and

(c) the ability to displace rather than absorb water in wet blastholes thus maintaining its
inherent frictional properties.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

77 AS 2187.2--2006

For effective distribution, the size of crushed angular rock should be related to the blasthole
diameter as shown in Table E1. In operations where severe flyrock restrictions apply, some
form of protective cover (see Paragraph E3.7) should be considered.

TABLE E1

CRUSHED ROCK SIZING FOR VARIOUS

BLASTHOLE DIAMETERS

E3.5 Initiation

|Blasthole diameter<br>mm|Crushed rock sizing<br>mm|
|---|---|
|50-130<br>130-200|6-13<br>13-19|

Adequate allowance for inter-hole or inter-row delay to enable progressive relief of burden
to occur throughout a blast is a key factor in controlling flyrock ejection. The specific time
interval is dependent upon the delay system (down the blasthole or on the surface), rock
strength, stemming depth and explosive type.

The delay sequence should be arranged to encourage rock throwaway from locations
requiring protection.

In sensitive areas (e.g., urban quarries) where most blasting utilizes less than 100 mm
diameter blastholes, the use of detonating cord downlines to initiate the explosive column
should be minimized as these may create a chimney effect through the stemming thus
promoting premature escape of blast gases to the atmosphere. Detonating cord surface lines
should not be used in sensitive areas.

E3.6 Blast pattern shape and alignment

The blast design is determined by the type of rock, the degree of fragmentation required,
special anomalies or restrictions at the blast site and what result is to be achieved. Deep
blasts, that is, greater than five rows for large blasthole diameters and greater than three
rows for small blasthole diameters, may exhibit flyrock from the back rows. Experience has
shown that the ideal case is to design blast patterns with length to depth dimensions in the
ratio of 3:4 if flyrock is to be avoided.

Where major items of stationary equipment (e.g., crushers, pumping stations) are included
in the pit design, it may be an advantage to orientate the bench faces so that the principal
rock movement is not directly towards this equipment.

E3.7 Protective cover

Where any doubt exists, or where the blast situation demands added precautions, sufficient
cover should be placed on the blast to prevent any possibility of resulting flyrock. Examples
of where additional cover might be necessary are shallow blasting, proximity to protected
works, or where blasting is carried out underneath powerlines or adjacent to buildings,
roadways, railways, or other structures.

Common forms of protective cover include blasting mats, conveyor belting, truck tyres and
steel plate but, due to their bulk, these are limited to small blasts. A technique involving the
firing of a blast directly into a previously shot blast (buffer blasting) can be used to reduce
any potential flyrock generated from the vertical free face. However, this technique
constrains overall rock movement and may enhance flyrock due to cratering charges. Its
effectiveness is limited to rocks that exhibit a high degree of natural fracturing. In
situations where misfired charges are to be refired and excessive flyrock is anticipated, it
may be necessary to backfill or cover the charge with broken rock to minimize the flyrock
problem.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 78

The following advice is particularly applicable to small scale blasting operations.

When backfilling is used to cover charged blastholes this should be sorted material without
stones. The cover should be placed with care to avoid damage to connecting wires or
detonating cord trunklines and should be to a minimum depth which would eliminate
flyrock. Strips of conveyor belting laid over the leadwires will protect them from damage
when backfilling.

If using blasting mats to provide cover, the following precautions should be observed:

(a) A layer of sand or sandbags should cover the rock, at least in the area of the blasthole
collar, to protect the mat from being damaged.

(b) Only the number of blastholes that can be adequately covered by blasting mats should
be loaded and fired at one time. Mats should be anchored where practicable.

(c) Rock or debris should not be placed on top of the mats, as these may become
missiles.

(d) If firing more than one blasthole in sequence, only short (i.e., millisecond type) delay
detonators should be used. Long delays (due to half-second delay detonators or safety
fuse firing) may lift the mats off the remaining unfired blastholes.

(e) Mats of wire rope or steel rings should not be used in the vicinity of overhead power
lines.

(f) Care must be taken when laying mats so that connecting wires or detonating cord
trunklines will not be damaged.

E4 FLY FORMATION

In addition to the factors identified in Paragraph E2, fly can be generated from the many
and varied blasting operations other than in rock. These include but are not limited to the
following:

(a) Failure to test or research the material(s) to be blasted;

(b) Brittle nature of the material(s) being blasted, e.g., wood, steel, slag, etc.;

(c) The powder factor being used is too great;

(d) The MIC is too great;

(e) Insufficient covering or protection on or around the charges; and

(f) Materials used as a protective covering containing objects that may become fly
themselves.

FIRING CIRCUIT CONNECTIONS

(Informative)

F1 ELECTRIC FIRING

F1.1 Series connection

For series connection firing of explosives, the wires are connected as indicated in
Figure F1. A minimum current of 2 A should be provided for a series connection.

F1.2 Parallel connection

A parallel connection is one in which the electric detonators are connected to two common
points, and calls for a higher total amperage requirement than a series connection for more
than one detonator. A minimum of 0.75 A should be allowed for each detonator unless

otherwise advised by the detonator manufacturer. A firing machine specifically designed for
parallel firing shall be used and detonators should be tested individually for continuity.
Typical circuits are given in Figure F2(a) and (b).

The use of voltages exceeding 210 V in parallel circuits may result in ‘pinhole’ failures in
electric delay detonators due to the current arcing across from the fusehead to the detonator
tube and burning a pinhole in the tube. Detonators that have been vented in this manner do
not operate under designed pressure conditions, and may therefore fire erratically or misfire
due to the delay element being disrupted.

Arcing, with consequent pinholing, may be controlled by ensuring that the current to the
firing circuit is broken shortly after the fuseheads have fired and before arcing has
commenced by--

(a) using a special firing switch incorporating a rapid ‘make and break’ switch
mechanism;

(b) including a 50 ms delay (No. 2 short delay) detonator in the circuit and attaching it
firmly to a bus wire or firing lead so that it will break the circuit in approximately
50 ms; or

(c) connecting a shunt of heavy gauge wire across the end of the firing cable.

The value of the resistance should be such as to prevent the voltage on the last detonator to
fire rising above 50 V. A reverse parallel hook-up is helpful in preventing pinhole failures
(see Figure F2(c)).

F1.3 Series-in-parallel connection

A series-in-parallel connection consists of a number of series circuits connected in parallel.
A minimum current of 2 A should be provided for each series. The number of series that
can be used is controlled by the amperage available and the number of detonators in a
single series by voltage. Each series circuit should be tested in accordance with
Paragraph F1.5 before being connected to parallel wires. Figure F3 illustrates a typical
circuit.

F1.4 Parallel-in-series connection

In a parallel-in-series connection circuit, the detonators are connected in parallel in a
number of groups and the groups connected in series. The current to be provided for this
type of circuit is determined by the requirements of the primary connections. Figure F4
illustrates a typical circuit.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 80

F1.5 Connection and testing of electrical firing circuits

When electric detonators are to be initiated through an exploder the following circuitry
checks should be observed:

(a) When a series circuit is used, like-coloured wires should be joined together for ease
of checking.

(b) Where clamp-type mechanical connectors are used for joining detonator lead wires, or
similar connections, the insulation should not be removed and bared ends should be
cut off. For the joining of the ends of all wires and cables where clamp-type
mechanical connectors are not used, the insulation should be removed for a maximum
length of 50 mm and the wires should then be made clean and bright for a minimum
length of 25 mm. The ends to be joined should be twisted together so as to have
positive metal contact.

(c) Grease-filled mechanical clamp type connectors should be used in wet conditions and
with water-based explosives.

(d) If the cable and joints appear to be properly connected but overall lack of electrical
continuity is still evident, each detonator should be checked for fault by connecting it
individually to the cable and testing from the firing position with the circuit tester. In
the case of large rounds, the circuit should be divided into halves, each half being
connected to the cable and the faulty half again divided successively until the faulty
detonator is identified. A similar procedure should be carried out when checking for
current leakage.

(e) As well as the detonator circuits, firing cables and connecting wire should be tested
for the following:

(i) Short-circuit A short-circuit is indicated when a resistance reading is obtained
on a circuit tester when one end of the cable is connected to the meter and the

other end has both conductors separated.

(ii) Open-circuit An open circuit is indicated when the meter registers an infinite
resistance or a resistance substantially higher than the resistance of the cable
when the open ends of a cable, at the end remote from the meter, are connected.

(iii) Current leakage Current leakage is the loss of part of the firing current and is
due to damaged (or inadequate) insulation in lead wires or poorly insulated
connections. If the resistance of the circuit through the earth is less than the
resistance of the firing circuit, current will flow through the earth in preference
to the firing circuit. This can lead to misfires, as some detonators may not
receive sufficient electrical energy for initiation. It is most common in moist or
wet conditions or in highly mineralized ground. Current leakage can be
minimized by ensuring that--

(A) blastholes are thoroughly cleaned out before charging commences;

(B) lead wires are not kinked; and

(C) connections are insulated or kept clear of the ground.

A special earth leakage tester should be used in blasts where current leakage is
suspected.

(f) If the testing of the cables and circuits has been carried out satisfactorily, the ends of
the cable may be connected to the exploding device.

APPENDIX G

DETERIORATION OF EXPLOSIVES

(Informative)

G1 GENERAL

Explosives may become defective owing to various causes including poor storage
conditions, ageing and extreme weather conditions. This Appendix sets out the more
common visible signs in terms of the various types of explosives available.

G2 WATER-GEL EXPLOSIVES

Water-gel explosives are gelled, saturated aqueous solutions usually containing suspended
solids and consisting of water, oxidizing salts, fuel components, and various sensitizers.

Water-gels deteriorate if the gel matrix breaks down. In these cases, the composition
becomes no longer gel-like or uniform in consistency. Also the ingredients separate into
readily identifiable layers, large crystals grow and the suspended solids settle down.

When water-gels deteriorate they generally become less sensitive and may not detonate.
Consequently they should be destroyed as recommended by the manufacturer. If it is
intended to destroy such explosives by burning, because some water-gels are difficult to
ignite, a generous supply of kindling or the use of fuel oil or kerosene may be required (see
also Appendix H).

G3 EMULSION EXPLOSIVES

Emulsion explosives consist of a saturated aqueous solution of oxidizing salts that are
finely dispersed through a continuous oil phase. They may contain additional suspended
solids and various sensitizers.

Emulsion explosives deteriorate when the emulsion structure breaks down. This may be due
to a separation of the oil and aqueous phases or due to crystallization of the aqueous phase.
As crystallization proceeds the explosive will lose its pliable characteristics.

As emulsions deteriorate they generally become less sensitive and may not detonate.
Consequently they should be destroyed as recommended by the manufacturer. If it is
intended to destroy emulsions by burning, it should be noted that some emulsions are
difficult to ignite (see also Appendix H).

G4 NITROGLYCERINE/NITROGLYCOL-BASED EXPLOSIVE

The visible signs of deterioration of nitroglycerine/nitroglycol-based explosives are as
follows:

(a) Exudation Exudation is the separation of nitroglycerine or other nitrobody from the
explosive as an oily liquid, which may be retained inside or appear on the outside of
the wrapper. Free nitroglycerine is sensitive to friction and percussion, and exuding
explosives may thus cause premature explosions.

(b) Moisture absorption Moisture absorption is caused by inorganic salts, such as
ammonium nitrate, in the explosive picking up water from the air. Moisture
absorption usually appears initially at the ends of the plugs and extends progressively
towards the centre. The liquid present is water containing dissolved salts and
sometimes colouring matter.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

89 AS 2187.2--2006

Moisture reduces the sensitivity to detonation with consequent risk of unexploded
explosives being left in blastholes. Resealing of liners of opened explosives cases or
cartons will reduce deterioration from this cause.

(c) Recrystallization Recrystallization occurs where soluble salts, such as nitrates, have
been dissolved out of the explosive by water, either absorbed or derived from some
other source, and the solutions formed have dried out. This drying-out occurs
normally outside the wrappers and most commonly at the ends, resulting in crystalline
deposits of soluble salts.

Recrystallization involves loss of oxygen-supplying salts by the explosive mixture. Its
efficiency is thereby impaired and this may result in incomplete detonation.

Recrystallization can also result in liquid nitroglycerine being trapped between the
sharp crystals and it is possible for it to detonate if disturbed. For this reason it is
recommended that explosives in this condition be destroyed. If it is necessary to move
explosives in this condition, they should be handled carefully, without breaking up
the crystallized mass.

G5 DETONATORS

Detonators can deteriorate, either from age or improper storage, so that they are unfit for
use. Such detonators may be very dangerous to handle, and it is recommended that they not
be disturbed until they have been inspected by the manufacturer’s representative or the
regulatory authority.

Detonators should be destroyed if they have ever been underwater, for example during
flood, regardless of whether or not they have been subsequently dried out. In some cases,
the shells that have been wet and then dried will show signs of corrosion. Many detonators
contain lead azide, which is highly sensitive. In a copper shell detonator where corrosion
has occurred, a reaction with lead azide can occur forming cupric azide, which is extremely
sensitive and unstable.

H1 METHOD

H1.1 Procedure for cartridged explosives and cast boosters

In addition to the requirements specified in Section 11, the following steps are suggested as
a procedure for burning cartridged explosives and/or cast boosters:

(a) Determine the size of the exclusion zone and at what point of time it needs to be
established (see Notes 1 and 2).

(b) Select and clear an area that will minimize the spread of fire. Additional precautions
may be necessary.

(c) Lay out the required number of ‘trails’ of sawdust or wood shavings adequate to
create a bed for the quantity of explosives to be burned, approximately 200 mm wider
than the length of the longest cartridge, and 25 mm deep, upon which the explosive
will be laid. The trails should be aligned with the wind direction (see Notes 3 and 4).

A maximum of four individual trails may be laid side-by-side (not end to end). They
should be a minimum of 600 m apart.

(d) Thoroughly check that all cartridges are free of detonators (see Note 5).

(e) Place the cartridges on the trail making sure--

(i) there is at least 1 m of the trail left without any explosives at the downwind
end;

(ii) the cartridges are parallel to each other (not end to end in a line) along the
middle of the trail;

(iii) the cartridges are not touching (a good rule of thumb is to leave a minimum of
one cartridge diameter between each cartridge);

(iv) the cartridges are not piled on top of each other; and

(v) the maximum quantity of explosives in each individual trail is not more than
12 kg.

(f) Remove any explosive that is not to be burnt to a distance of at least 300 m and place
it where it cannot be hit by any fly or flyrock that might occur during the burning.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

91 AS 2187.2--2006

(g) Use slow igniter cord as a wick or, if it is not available, make a wick out of sheets of
paper loosely rolled together. Lay out and attach the wick to the downwind end of
each trail. The wick should be an extension of the trail.

(h) If igniter cord is used as a wick, one end should be coiled within the trail. If a paper
wick is used, ensure that at least 1 m of it is in contact with the trail. The wick should
be secured so that it cannot be accidentally dislodged by the wind after lighting.

(i) The length of the wick should be sufficient to allow the person(s) lighting it to retire
to the predetermined safe place after it has been lit.

(j) Thoroughly wet the trail and the explosives (and the paper wick) with kerosene or
diesel (never petrol or other highly flammable liquid) (see Note 6).

(k) Implement the exclusion zone if not already established.

(l) Implement the predetermined safety procedures, light the wick and retire to the predetermined safe place (see Note 7).

(m) Do not return to the site for at least 15 min after the burning has apparently finished.

(n) If the fire goes out before any trail has finished burning, do not approach for at least
15 min after all trace of fire has apparently gone.

(o) Do not add more kerosene or diesel while there is any potential for re-ignition during
application.

NOTES:

1 This may need to be during the delivery or preparation stage of the work. The condition of the
explosives and the quantity to be burned can influence the decision making process.

2 The size of the exclusion zone should be large enough to allow for the possibility of an
explosion occurring during the burn.

3 The trail(s) should be aligned such that the flame from the trail and the burning explosives
will blow away from the unburned explosives as detonation is more likely to occur if the
explosives are preheated by the flame.

4 Some emulsion and water-gel explosives are difficult to burn and may require additional fuel.
The manufacturer or supplier should be contacted if large quantities of these explosives are to
be destroyed.

5 Puncture marks in the side or the end of a cartridge can indicate the possible presence of a
detonator.

6 The use of excess fuel will only soak into the ground and unnecessarily prolong burning that
might not include explosives.

7 If more than one wick is to be lit, it is recommended that either the wicks are joined or a
multiple fuse lighter is used.

H1.2 Variations for other explosives

H1.2.1 Detonating cord

Detonating cord should not be burnt on a reel or spool but cut into lengths, or loosely
coiled, and placed on top of the trail(s) as for cartridged explosives. It should be burnt in
lots not greater than the equivalent of two 10 g/m reels at a time or a maximum of 1000 m,
whichever is the lesser. Extreme care should be taken to ensure that there are no detonators

or detonating delay devices attached to any part of the detonating cord.

H1.2.2 Safety fuse

Other than a possible fire or pollution hazard, there is little danger with safety fuse,
provided that care is taken to ensure that it is free of detonators. It may be destroyed by
burning on an open fire.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 92

H1.2.3 Igniter cords

When burning igniter cord it should be completely uncoiled from its spool. It will not need
fuel to assist in the burning process and an area well cleared of flammable material is
necessary as it can whip violently during burning. A length of safety fuse is recommended
as a wick as it will allow the person lighting it to be well clear prior to the igniter cord

APPENDIX I

EXTRANEOUS ELECTRICITY

(Informative)

I1 SCOPE

This Appendix provides guidance on the source of various forms of extraneous electricity
and sets out recommendations on preventive measures, paying particular attention to stray
currents and static electricity. It also suggests appropriate distances between electroexplosive devices and sources of radio frequency radiation (see Table I1).

I2 SOURCES OF EXTRANEOUS ELECTRICITY

Extraneous electricity may result from both natural and man-made situations, as follows:

(a) Lightning Lightning is a high energy source capable of initiating explosives. The
situation may be aggravated if there are conductors in the vicinity of the point of the
lightning discharge that lead to the loading site, e.g., conductive ore body, water
pipes or other services, rail tracks, fencing wires.

(b) Induced currents, capacitive discharge Induced currents may be present in areas
such as around power stations and earth loop transport systems (rail, trams, trolley
locomotives). Capacitive discharge may occur where high voltage transmission lines
charge a suspended, above-ground blasting circuit to a high voltage. This voltage may
then be discharged to earth through a detonator thus causing a premature explosion.

(c) Accidental earthing If there is an accidental earthing of a power transmission line in
the vicinity of a circuit, a premature explosion might occur.

(d) Transmitters When using electric initiation, there is a possibility of the blasting
circuit being energized by the electric field produced by radio transmitters, radar,
television transmitters or the like. Table I1 provides recommendations for safe
distances.

(e) Static electricity While electrostatic charges are among the most common
phenomena in nature and the mechanism of the formation of the charges is
controversial, the potential for an electrostatic charge to initiate a detonator or black
powder is very real.

For a dangerous condition to exist, three criteria have to be met, as follows:

(i) A capacitor-like object needs to be charged to a potential (voltage) such that the
electrical energy stored in this system is large enough to cause initiation when
released as a discharge. For example, the capacitor can be a person or ANFO
loading equipment.

(ii) The capacitor has to lose its charge to cause ignition.

(iii) The path of this discharge needs to be sufficiently close to the sensitive
material to cause ignition or initiation.

As it is difficult to control Items (ii) and (iii), Item (i) offers the best potential for
introducing preventive measures and thus minimizing an electrostatic charge build
up.

AS 2187.2--2006 94

I3 GENERAL PREVENTIVE MEASURES

The possibility of premature initiation from extraneous electricity is always a potential
hazard. Where extraneous electricity is suspected or evident, detailed information should be
sought from the manufacturers as to the suitability of their products and initiation systems
in particular circumstances. Some preventive measures applicable to all initiation systems
are as follows:

(a) Use a non-electric initiation system.

(b) Ensure all bare connectors in, or to be used in, a circuit are kept short-circuited by
twisting the ends together until final connection.

(c) Avoid situations that might generate and store static electricity.

(d) Take special care to ensure that bare lead wires do not come into contact with the
ground and that connections are either insulated or kept clear of the ground.

(e) Cease all surface charging operations if an electrical storm is imminent. If working
underground, assess any possible dangers from lightning and take appropriate action.

(f) Keep detonators clear of the ground until charging commences.

Specific recommendations on stray currents and static electricity are provided in
Paragraphs I4 and I5.

I4 STRAY CURRENTS

I4.1 General

Under certain conditions there may be a possibility that stray electrical currents might
initiate premature detonation. As a guide to determining the possibility of such currents
existing on a particular site, the following information is included:

(a) Where electrically operated equipment, including welding equipment, is used, it is
possible for stray currents to be generated from faulty circuits and equipment. These
currents may pass through the ground itself as well as continuous metal objects such
as haulage rails, pipelines, ventilating ducts or wire ropes.

(b) As the minimum firing current for electric detonators is 250 mA, tests for stray
currents should be sensitive to at least 60 mA, a.c. or d.c.

(c) Tests for stray currents should be carried out in advance of electric firing, particularly
in highly conductive ground or where continuous metal objects extend up to the area
being charged with explosives. A suitable test is given in Paragraph I4.2.

(d) In mining operations, any electric welding being carried out on rail track, steel
ground support or the like should be halted prior to any electrical detonators being
transported into the tunnel either in an explosives car or by other means. Welding
should not recommence until the blasting operation has been safely completed and
any surplus detonators returned to the explosives magazine.

I4.2 Testing for stray currents

A high impedance (10 MΩ or more) voltmeter should be used to test for stray currents. Two
probes made of identical material 25 mm in diameter and 200 mm long should be driven
into the ground or placed between the locations in question being tested, e.g., damp spots,
pipes, rails, conductive ore bodies. Stainless steel is recommended for probes.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

95 AS 2187.2--2006

As any source of potential can be dangerous (whether caused by stray currents or something
else) it is advisable to try to locate the greater potential difference within a radius of 1 m to
2 m from the point where the detonator leads are likely to be placed. Once the highest
potential difference has been found, a low-impedance ammeter (1 Ω or less) should be
placed across the probes and the current recorded. If the current is less than or equal to
60 mA, the situation is reasonably safe. If the current is more than 60 mA, special
precautions should be taken to ensure the bare lead wires cannot come in contact with the
ground. Where possible, all stray currents that are found should be eliminated.

It is advisable to test for stray currents over a period of time in order to be aware of
fluctuations, which may become more pronounced when heavy equipment is started or
operated in the vicinity of the test area.

I5 STATIC ELECTRICITY

I5.1 General

Dangerous levels of static electricity may be generated in a number of ways, for example by
dust storms, snowstorms, moving conveyor belts, the pneumatic loading of free-flowing
granular explosives or sand stemming into blastholes and even the action of pouring freeflowing granular explosives from a plastic container into paper cartridges or from the use of
plastic borehole liners.

I5.2 Dusty conditions, snowstorms

In a dry, dusty atmosphere, for example over a desert, the accumulation of static charges
may be substantial during dust storms. This may also apply during dry drifting snowstorms.
Although it is desirable to suspend all blasting operations during storms, these are often of
such duration that practically no work would be possible for days on end. This applies most
often in seismic work, and certain precautions should be observed if work must be done
under these conditions. The recommended procedure to be adopted is as follows:

(a) Lay out the shotfiring cable.

(b) Short-circuit both ends and connect both to earth, say by driving a metal rod into the
ground, and wetting the ground if it is very dry.

(c) Short the detonator leading wires and attach their ends to earth.

(d) Uncoil the leading wires carefully and lay them along the ground. The wires must not
be thrown and, in uncoiling, the operator should handle the portion of the wire
adjacent to the detonator tube, not the tube itself. The operator should be earthed
before handling the detonator tube prior to insertion in the explosive, to prevent
possible sparking from tube to fusehead.

(e) Lower the charge into the blasthole as far as the leading wires will allow.

(f) Disconnect the leading wires from the earthed rod and connect them to the leads of
the shotfiring cable, which should also have been disconnected from earth.

(g) Do not disconnect the other end of the cable from earth until ready to fire.

(h) When operating near electric power lines, make sure that the leading wires and
shotfiring cable are securely anchored and placed so that they cannot be blown across
the power lines by the explosion.

I5.3 Other static electric hazards

The following precautions should be taken to deal with other static electric hazards:

(a) All machinery near the blasting area should, where possible, be well earthed.

(b) The wiring of the shotfiring circuit should be separated from large conductors such as
rails or piping and be protected and isolated with good insulation.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 96

I5.4 Pneumatic loading of free-flowing granular explosives

Before free-flowing granular explosives or dry stemming is pneumatically propelled into
blastholes that have been, or will be, primed with electric detonators, the following
precautions should be taken:

(a) Earth all pneumatic charging equipment. Where conditions are dry or the equipment
is separated from earth, provide special earthing cables with, if necessary, a spike
which is driven into the ground.

NOTE: Earth contact can be greatly enhanced by wetting with water or, preferably, with a
solution of common salt or ammonium nitrate in water.

(b) Equip the loader with a semi-conductive hose to discharge static to earth and prevent
the build up of high voltages.

(c) Check that the total resistance of the equipment and earth return is not more than
10 MΩ or otherwise conforms to the requirements of the regulatory authority.

(d) Do not use plastic liners in blastholes unless they are genuinely and permanently
conductive.

(e) Before starting to collar prime or connect up the detonator lead wires, the shotfirer
should withdraw the loading equipment, take off any protective gloves being worn
and be earthed.

It should also be noted that in certain circumstances a person can generate and hold enough
charge to fire a detonator.

NOTES:

1 Table I1 sets out recommendations for safe distances for blasting from electromagnetic radiation
when electric detonators are being used to detonate explosive charges. These distances may not
apply under desert and marine conditions, where special shotfiring methods adopted may give rise to
worse hazard. If two or more significant field sources are superimposed at the firing site a safety
assessment should be carried out.

2 If there are two or more significant transmitting sites radiating powers in excess of 50 kW, each
within 3000 m (see also Note 3 of the firing site, then a detailed site assessment should be
undertaken.

3 The tabled distances do not necessarily apply to transmitters utilizing ‘troposcatter’.

4 The distances apply directly in the case of standard commercial detonators with leads unwound or
partially unwound during normal handling and when connected into firing circuits. The distances are
from the transmitter to the nearest point of the proposed firing circuit.

5 This Table may require amendment as further information on radiation sources becomes available.

6 ‘Movable’ implies vehicle-borne equipment, which requires erection of a portable aerial for

APPENDIX J

GROUND VIBRATION AND AIRBLAST OVERPRESSURE

(Informative)

J1 INTRODUCTION

The contents of this Appendix are designed to be informative and are not intended to override existing statutory requirements, particularly with respect to human comfort limits set
by various authorities. This Appendix should be read in conjunction with any such statutory
requirements and with regard to their respective jurisdictions. The intention of the present
recommendations for both human comfort limits and damage limits is to provide
information that reflects current best practice globally.

This Appendix addresses two common environmental effects of blasting: ground vibration
and airblast. It provides background information, guidelines for measurement and criteria
for peak levels.

It is recognized that ground vibration and airblast produced by blasting falls into two
categories--

(a) those causing human discomfort; and

(b) those with the potential for causing damage to structures, architectural elements and
services.

Generally, human discomfort levels set by authorities are less than the levels that are likely
to cause damage to structures, architectural elements and services. Ground vibration and
airblast levels are influenced by a number of factors, some of which are not under the
control of the shotfirer.

Complaints may arise following a blast and it is recommended that accurate records be
maintained. Such records should describe the location of the blast and all the blastholes, the
design of the blast in terms of explosives and initiating system usage and ground vibration
and airblast measurement data. It is recommended that the records be kept for at least seven
(7) years. A longer period of retention of the records may be warranted if a region of the
mine, quarry or construction project is blasted over an extended or disrupted period.
Standardized criteria for ground vibration and airblast are used to evaluate a blast. There
are various jurisdictions and sources for these criteria and this Appendix presents pertinent
information and references to it.

The correct measurement of ground vibration and airblast requires systems with adequate
sensitivity, dynamic range and frequency response. People may easily confuse the sources
of their discomfort. Not only may they assess incorrectly the true level of ground vibration
and airblast but they misconstrue the actual source. For example, secondary noise is often
attributed to ground vibration but this noise, such as windows and crockery rattling, may
have been caused either by the ground vibration or airblast. Persons responsible for, or
involved with the blast, should have a good understanding of such issues and be able to
communicate that understanding to affected people. Monitoring records may support the
communication.

Blasts should be designed according to the prevailing regulatory controls from both a
human comfort and damage perspective. All efforts should be made to minimise
environmental disturbances.

Information in this Appendix is presented as follows:

(i) Paragraph J1 provides a general introduction.

airblast.

(iii) Paragraph J3 describes typical measurement system requirements and procedures.

comfort that some authorities have chosen. It also gives levels for the prevention of
damage to structures, architectural elements and services from ground vibration.

some authorities have chosen. It also gives levels for the prevention of damage to
structures, architectural elements and services from airblast.

airblast are of concern and suggests a protocol for communication in the event of
complaints arising from ground vibration and airblast produced by blasting.

(vii) Paragraph J7 provides methods for the preliminary estimation of ground vibration and
airblast magnitudes

(viii) Paragraph J8 provides a bibliography of work relevant to this Appendix.

J2 DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENA

J2.1 Ground vibration

Ground vibration from blasting is the radiation of mechanical energy within a rock mass or
soil. It comprises various vibration phases travelling at different velocities. These phases
are reflected, refracted, attenuated and scattered within the rock mass or soil, so that the
resulting ground vibration at any particular location will have a complex character with
various peaks and frequency content. Typically, higher frequencies are attenuated rapidly so
that at close distances to the source such frequencies will be present in greater proportion
than at far distances from the source.

The magnitude of the ground vibration together with ground vibration frequency are
commonly used to define damage criteria. The choice of the appropriate damage criterion
may require consideration of the frequencies arising from the blast.

Studies and experience show that well designed and controlled blasts are unlikely to create
ground vibrations of a magnitude that causes damage. Particular structures such as tall
buildings, or abnormal ground conditions such as water-logged ground, should be carefully
considered in a specialist study.

Cracks in buildings may be attributable to causes other than ground vibration, including
ground or foundation movements (settlement and swell) associated with reactive clay soils
during periods of prolonged dry or wet weather.

J2.2 Airblast

Airblast is the pressure wave (sound) produced by the blast and transmitted through the air.
Unlike ground vibration there is only one airblast phase but it too is a complex wave-train
consisting of various peaks and with a range of frequencies. The sources of airblast include
a usually small air pressure pulse generated by the ground vibration, a direct air pressure
pulse generated by the rock movement during blasting and an air pressure pulse caused by
direct venting of gases from the region of the blast. It is important to recognise that airblast
may be reflected by layers within the atmosphere and that the airblast may be refocused at
distances remote from the blast.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 100

Airblast may be heard by people if it contains energy in the audible frequency range,
typically between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. However, some of the energy is sub-audible and lies
in the frequency range between 2 Hz and 20 Hz. Such low frequency airblast is often
experienced indoors as secondary audible effects, such as rattling of windows and of sliding
doors. A blast perceived as loud may have a low airblast level and a blast that is barely
noticeable outdoors may have a high airblast level.

At distances where both effects are above perceptible levels, airblast is usually felt after any
ground vibration. Ground-transmitted vibration waves from a blast normally travel faster
than the air-transmitted airblast overpressure.

Airblast is generally the cause of more complaints than ground vibration.

Airblast levels that are barely noticeable are much lower than those that will cause damage.
Because of a large dynamic range, airblast levels are measured typically on a logarithmic
decibel scale (dB). On this scale, an increase of 6 decibels represents a doubling of the
sound pressure levels.

Airblast levels may also be reported as an A-weighted (dBA) or C-weighted (dBC) value.
These scales adjust the frequency content of the measured airblast time history. Linearweighting (dBL) implies no adjustment of the frequency content in the measured records.
The A-weighting is commonly associated with the hearing response of humans and is most
often used for assessing general noise levels associated with machinery and vehicular
traffic. The C-weighting, which attenuates the frequencies more than does A-weighting, is
often used for impulsive sounds such as the sonic booms of aircraft.

As an example, if a sound level meter measures an airblast level of 115 dBL, the same
meter would measure approximately 90 dBA for the same event. The frequency content of
the particular airblast time history will determine the relative levels between the dBL and
dBA readings.

All airblasts should be reported on the dBL scale, particularly when considering structural
and architectural effects, and the other weighting scales should be used as required.

J3 MEASUREMENT

J3.1 General

J3.1.1 Management

The proper management of blasting operations demands that records be kept for each blast.
As a minimum, this includes the blast location, the blast geometry, the explosives loaded,
the initiation design and the location of any man-made or natural structures that may be
affected by the blast. Such information is invaluable for continuous improvement of the
desirable outcomes from the blast, but also provides information for analyses concerning
ground vibration and airblast exceedences.

Measurements of ground vibration and airblast are made in a variety of ways and for
different reasons. While a standard approach is recommended, it must be remembered that
blasting will have a different end effect on each and every structure. The standard approach
is useful for routine monitoring of relatively standard blasts under relatively uniform
conditions.

Special monitoring techniques may be required for other conditions, but these are not
addressed in this Appendix.

It is emphasized that measurement equipment used should comply with Paragraphs J3.2.1
and J3.3.1 of this Standard. It should be noted that regulatory authorities may require or
approve the use of equipment with specifications different from those given in
Paragraphs J3.2.1 and J3.3.1 to meet specific situations.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

101 AS 2187.2--2006

J3.1.2 Typical blast monitoring guidelines

The following are intended only as general guidelines, and cannot describe methods for all
types of field conditions:

(a) Read the instrument instruction manual An operator should be familiar with the
instrument and competent in its use. Emphasis must be placed on awareness of
maintenance issues.

(b) Instrument calibration Instrument calibration must be maintained, be traceable and
documented. As a guideline, instrument calibration should be carried out at intervals
not exceeding 12 months.

(c) Pre-blast preparation The operator must be informed of the monitoring conditions
before setting out, particularly the size of blast, the designed effective charge mass
per delay, the designed blast duration and distance to all monitoring locations. Other
pertinent data that should be noted include user’s name, date, time, location,
instrument trigger levels and instrument identification number.

(d) Record the full waveform The instrument must have sufficient memory capacity
available and be configured to save waveforms long enough for the blast design and
distance. As a rule of thumb, 3 seconds per kilometre should be allowed plus the blast
duration. Under certain circumstances, particularly for airblast recording using a
sound level meter with acceptable frequency response, it may be appropriate to use a
calibrated instrument that records only peak levels with and without weighting
factors.

(e) Record the blast The effort of deploying the instrument justifies sufficient care to
ensure a successful recording. Once installed on site, the system must be tested, and
trigger levels must be as low as possible yet sufficiently above local background to
avoid spurious events. Having saved the measurement, the data must be secured and
available for any subsequent analysis.

(f) Ground vibration transducer placement The ground vibration transducer should be
effectively coupled as described in Paragraph J3.2.2.

(g) Microphone The microphone should be mounted at a height of not less than one
metre with the windshield attached as described in Paragraph J3.3.2.

J3.2 Ground vibration

J3.2.1 Measuring equipment

Typically, the measurement of ground vibrations uses transducers for particle velocity
(geophone) or particle acceleration (accelerometer). Accelerometers tend to be used in
specialist applications due to their (generally) superior specifications. The data from
accelerometers may be converted readily to particle velocity by integration, either in
hardware or software. The discussion in this clause is restricted to measurements of particle
velocity.

Particle velocity is normally expressed in millimetres per second (mm/s). A vibration
transducer should produce signals for three mutually orthogonal axes and preferably with
one sensor measuring the vertical direction and the other two in horizontal directions. This
arrangement enables a rapid assessment of vibrations in a coordinate system applicable to
most man-made structures. Data records in three orthogonal directions may be transformed
into any other curvilinear coordinate system that is relevant to the structure of concern.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 102

The measurement equipment should record, and be able to play back these signals for the
full duration of the blast event. The measurement equipment, or associated software, should
indicate the absolute maximum signal value for each of the three components over this
duration, referred to as the Peak Component Particle Velocity (PCPV). Also the
measurement equipment should indicate the maximum of a root sum of squares calculation
for the three components performed over the whole signal duration, referred to as the
Vector Peak Particle Velocity (VPPV). Instrumentation noise (including electrical
disturbances) measured as a peak value should be less than 10% of VPPV. The frequency

−
range of the measurement equipment must be at least 2 Hz to 250 Hz ( 3 dB roll off), with
a tolerance of 10% over this frequency range (see Figure J3.2.1). The use of equipment with
a frequency response range of 5 to 250 Hz, which was specified in AS 2187.2--1993,
should be permitted in the vast majority of situations where this frequency range is
adequate. For a digital system, the recommended minimum sampling frequency is 500 Hz.

FIGURE J3.2.1 TYPICAL PARTICLE VELOCITY VIBRATION RESPONSE ACCURACY

J3.2.2 Measuring technique

The purpose of the measurement is to measure the magnitude of ground vibration that is
transmitted to the structure at ground level.

Ground vibrations should normally be measured on the ground near the point of concern.
The measurement location(s) should be away from structures that may produce reflections
and cause spurious readings. Poor ground conditions for instrument coupling or lack of
access should not preclude taking measurements on the foundation of the structure at
ground level; however, it should be noted that measurements taken on the structure above
ground level can be misleading as they are often exaggerated by structural or modal
response. The choice of locations and the process of undertaking ground vibration
measurement should be restricted to competent persons.

When setting up the instrument, the operator should estimate the likely range of ground
vibration in order to set appropriate scales and trigger levels.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

103 AS 2187.2--2006

The basis for coupling the transducer is to ensure that it faithfully records the motion of the
ground. The preferred coupling method depends on site conditions. Where there is a rigid
surface (e.g., concrete or rock) adhesive or mechanical bonding can be used. Where the
surface is soil, the transducer can be embedded or fixed to an embedded mount (for
example, 200 mm concrete cube or similarly sized cylinder). If measurements are repeated
at the same location, an embedded mount is particularly justified for consistency of results.
Coupling with soil spikes in soft conditions may lead to exaggerated measurements and is
not recommended.

The orientation of all transducers with respect to the blast location should be documented
by the operator. The information needs to be sufficient so that each and every component
vibration can be placed in the same global coordinate system used for the blastholes within
a blast. Such orientation information is also required for triaxial transducers housed in an
integrated container.

J3.3 Airblast

J3.3.1 Measuring equipment

The measurement of airblast overpressure uses a microphone and the airblast is usually
expressed in Pascals (Pa) or decibels Linear (dBL). The measurement equipment should
record the absolute maximum pressure level. In general, it is recommended that the
measurement equipment record, and be able to reproduce this signal for the full duration of
the blast event. The measurement equipment should indicate the absolute maximum signal
value in dBL, a logarithmic (decibel) scale with linear weighting referred to a pressure of
20 mPa. This scale does not modify the frequency content of the airblast and may be used
for assessing the likelihood of airblast-induced damage. Instrumentation noise (including
electrical disturbances) measured as a peak value should be at least 20 dBL less than the
measured peak. The frequency range of the measurement equipment must be at least 2 Hz to
250 Hz (−3 dB roll off), with a tolerance of ±1 dBL over this frequency range (see
Figure J3.3.1). For a digital system, the recommended minimum sampling frequency is
500 Hz.

Where the airblast measurement is triggered by the ground vibration, the recording duration
has to be sufficient for the monitoring distance. As a rule of thumb, 3 s per kilometre is
allowed, plus the blast duration.

It is useful for the recording equipment and/or the associated software to have provision for
analysing the airblast levels using an A-weighting, C-weighting and the associated sound
exposure levels in order to provide extra information relating to human comfort levels.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 104

FIGURE J3.3.1 MICROPHONE RESPONSE ACCURACY

J3.3.2 Measuring technique

The microphone should be oriented in a direction of maximum sensitivity to the incident
sound. A windshield should be fitted in accordance with the manufacturer’s

recommendations.

The microphone should be mounted on a tripod or similar stable stand and located at least
1 m from ground level unless a specific investigation shows that measurements taken at a
lower height are valid. It should be located away from structures that may produce
reflections and cause spurious readings.

J3.4 Blast monitoring records

Blast monitoring records provide the data for determining any improvements in blast
outcomes, including the management and control of ground vibration and airblast. As a
minimum, blast monitoring records should include the following:

(a) The size of the blast in terms of the number of blastholes and the quantity of
explosives in each blasthole.

(b) The method of initiation and the timing sequence to be used in the blast.

(c) The date and time of the blast.

(d) The location of the measurement transducers (geophones, accelerometers,
microphones).

(e) Instrument trigger levels.

(f) Measurement equipment and operator details.

(g) The location of the blast in relation to the mine, quarry or construction site lease.

(h) The location of any structures and/or persons who may be affected by the blast.

(j) The measured ground vibration and airblast values including the peak particle
velocity values for each of the triaxial components, a derived vector peak particle
value and the peak airblast levels.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

105 AS 2187.2--2006

Blast monitoring records should, wherever possible, include the following:

(i) The location of each blasthole collar.

(ii) Face survey information indicating the proximity of the nearest blastholes to any free
faces within the blast.

(iii) Full time histories of the ground vibration and airblast responses.

(iv) Weather conditions, especially wind speed, cloud cover and direction and any other
notable conditions such as rain.

(v) Information derived from a video of the blast.

(vi) Any subjective information from the shotfirer and any persons who may be affected
by the blast.

A copy of these records should be included in the site blast records.

J4 GROUND VIBRATION LEVELS

J4.1 General

The maximum levels for ground vibration for human comfort that some authorities have
chosen are set out in Paragraphs J4.2 to J4.5.

NOTE: The maximum levels advised in this Appendix are designed to be informative and are not
intended to override existing statutory requirements, particularly with respect to human comfort
limits set by various authorities.

The methods of data analysis for these limits are also presented. In part, such analyses are a
departure from that described in earlier and other Standards and the intention is to provide
sufficient detail so that expert persons may implement these in hardware and/or software.

J4.2 Ground vibration

Vibration transmitted through the ground may cause damage to structures and architectural
elements or discomfort to their occupants. The vibration levels at which people become
annoyed are well below vibration levels at which damage occurs. The likelihood of such
damage or discomfort may be ascertained by measuring the vibration from a blast close to
the location of concern such as a building or other structure.

For all limits it is necessary to measure in three orthogonal directions, one in the vertical
direction and the other two in perpendicular horizontal directions. Such measurements align
with most structural members in man-made structures. From such measurements it is

possible to derive the Vector Peak Particle Velocity (VPPV) and the Peak Component
Particle Velocity for each direction (PCPV). The magnitude of the vector particle velocity
(v p ) is the amplitude of the vector sum of three time-synchronised velocity components
directly measured by an instrument. When not measured directly it may be determined by
the following Equation:

v p = v x2 + v 2y + v z2 . . . J4.2

where v x, v y and v z are the synchronized instantaneous velocity components of the x, y and z
axes, respectively. The VPPV is the maximum of v p .

J4.4 Damage limits

J4.4.1 General

Frequency independent and frequency dependent guide levels are described in both British
Standard BS 7385-2 and the United States Bureau of Mines (USBM) RI 8507. The levels
specified are peak component particle velocities, and the methodologies used for assessing
the frequencies are similar in both documents.

Frequency-dependent criteria are important for assessing the blast-induced vibration effects
on buildings and other structures and are the recommended approach.

J4.4.2 Frequency-independent levels

Frequency-dependent criteria may not be readily implemented for all parties concerned with
this Standard.

For explosives users who do not have the facilities to use frequency-dependent assessment
methods, the levels specified in Table J4.5(B), which are more conservative for most
blasting applications, will reduce the potential for damage. The Table should be used in
conjunction with the notes that follow it.

Wherever possible, the ground vibration levels from all blasting operations must be limited
to the damage limit criteria shown below in Figures J4.4.2.1 or J4.4.2.2 at all sites not in the
ownership or control of the organisation commissioning the blasting.

Authoritative investigations (see Paragraph J8, Item 1) suggest that the guide values and
assessment methods given in BS 7385-2 and (USBM) RI 8507 are applicable to Australian
conditions, and are recommended for explosives users with the facilities to make use of
these methods.

The estimation of the frequency of each vibration component to be used in structural
damage assessment is complex. Simple approaches suggested within the BS 7385-2 and
(USBM) RI 8507 includes--

(a) frequency of the maximum PPV amplitude peak;

(b) dominant frequency of the component vibration time history; and

(c) zero crossing frequency of the PPV amplitude peak.

The (USBM) RI 8507 and BS 7385-2 methodologies for assessing frequencies have been
widely used for many years, and were suitable for use with desktop and laptop computers
with the power that was commonly available in the 1980s and early 1990s. It appears that
the motion frequencies determined by simple methods, such as zero crossing, are
conservative for assessing damage potential.

NOTE: A method under development, which may give greater accuracy, uses the
(USBM) RI 8507 frequency-dependent limits (which are similar to the limits specified in
BS 7385-2) but with a more accurate methodology for assessing frequencies.

The method has been tested and published [see Fragblast 7-Beijing (1992) which may be found at
http://www.isee.org and search their publications]. At the time of writing this Standard, software
systems for the practical use of this method by explosives users were being developed, but were
not in general use.

J4.5 Recommended ground vibration limits

NOTE: Statutory requirements for human comfort limits for ground vibration may apply in
respective jurisdictions.

The maximum levels for ground vibration for human comfort, which some authorities have
chosen, are provided in Table J4.5(A). Recommended limits for ground vibration for
control of damage to structures are provided in Table J4.5(B).

Frequency-dependent limits have the capacity to precisely deal with the hazards presented
by ground vibration and are seen as the basis for best practice blasting. The particular
frequency-dependent criteria should be reported with the measurements. All the limits given
in Tables J4.5(A) and J4.5(B) are peak component particle velocities, as used in overseas
Standards and guidelines. The classification of type of structure may be difficult and when
in doubt, a more conservative limit from the nearest description in Table J4.5(B) should be
applied.

J5 AIRBLAST LEVELS

J5.1 General

Airblast can cause discomfort to persons and, at high levels, damage to structures and
architectural elements, and at very high levels, injury to persons.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

111 AS 2187.2--2006

The airblast levels at which people become annoyed are well below levels at which damage
has been proven to occur. The evaluation of the effects of blasting should separate human
response and structural/architectural damage effects of airblast. Of particular importance in
this regard is the frequency content of the airblast. For example, an airblast that is inaudible
to humans may still be responsible for structural/architectural damage effects. Conversely,
an airblast level that causes human discomfort may have negligible structural/architectural
damage effects. The limits set out in Paragraphs J5.2, J5.3 and J5.4 below offer a robust
means for differentiating such effects and are based upon studies conducted by various
workers in blasting.

The sound pressure level [SPL (dBL)] is defined as follows:

2 . . . J5.1

 P 
SPL = 10 log 10  []  []
P

 P 

 []  []
 P 0 

2

10 log 10  []  []

 P 0 

where P is the pressure level (Pa) and P 0 is the reference pressure of 20 mPa. It is generally
accepted that aural pain will occur in humans for SPL greater than 140 dBA for frequencies
in the range 20 Hz to 20 kHz and for SPL between 160 dBL and 170 dBL for frequencies
below 20 Hz.

General control limits currently used in Australia are not frequency dependent. It is
probable that continuing research and development will result in the development of
frequency-dependent limits and these should be adopted when available.

J5.2 Human comfort limits

NOTE: Statutory requirements for human comfort limits for airblast may apply in respective
jurisdictions.

Human comfort limits for airblast are linked to the annoyance produced. Several factors
contribute to annoyance by impulsive sounds such as airblast. These include the loudness,
duration and number of events plus the time of day and the nature of the disturbance.

J5.3 Damage limits

From Australian and overseas research, damage (even of a cosmetic nature) has not been
found to occur at airblast levels below 133 dBL. The probability of damage increases as the
airblast levels increase above this level. Windows are the building element currently
regarded as most sensitive to airblast, and damage to windows is considered as improbable
below 140 dBL.

A limit of 133 dBL is recommended as a safe level that will prevent structural/architectural
damage from airblast. Reference to Tables J4.4.2.2 and J4.4.2.3 should be made when
classifying damage.

J5.4 Recommended airblast limits

Airblast limits for human comfort chosen by some regulatory authorities are provided in
Table J5.4(A). Recommended damage control limits are given in Table 5.4(B). All the
limits are expressed as peak linear sound pressure levels. The classification of type of
structure may be difficult and, when in doubt, a more conservative limit from the nearest
description in Table J5.4(B) should be applied.

J6 OPERATING PRACTICE

J6.1 General

Shotfirers should endeavour to reduce ground vibration and airblast to as low a level as
practically possible to reduce the possibility of discomfort, damage, worry or complaint.
This should be reinforced by frequent consultation with persons who may be affected by the
blast.

Relevant blast personnel should be given regular training in these aspects of blasting. Blast
performance should be regularly reviewed and possible improvements implemented to
ensure a good relationship is maintained with persons who may be affected by the blast and
the regulatory authorities.

Control measures that may be effective in reducing the impact of ground vibration at a
particular site may include one or more of the following:

(a) Reducing maximum instantaneous charge (effective charge mass per delay) for
example by reducing blasthole diameter or deck loading.

(b) Using a combination of appropriate delays.

(c) Allowing for excessive humps or toe in the blast design.

(d) Optimizing blast design (changing burden and spacing) by altering drilling patterns,
delaying layout or alter blasthole inclination from the vertical.

(c) Using survey methods, as appropriate, to ensure burden is adequate.

(d) Keeping face heights to a practical minimum.

(e) Ensuring stemming type and length is adequate.

(f) Eliminating exposed detonating cord. Investigate alternative initiation methods.

(g) Eliminating secondary blasting (instead of popping, use rock breaker).

(h) Making extra efforts to eliminate the need for two shots (e.g., better control of drill
patterns).

(i) Considering delaying or cancelling the blast by not loading if the weather forecast is
unfavourable.

(j) Allowing for the effects of temperature inversion and wind speed and direction on the
propagation of airblast to surrounding areas.

(k) Orientating faces where possible so that they do not face directly towards residences.

(l) Varying the direction of initiation.

(m) Exercising strict control over the burden, spacing and orientation of all blastholes.

(n) Taking particular care where the face is already broken or where it is strongly jointed,
sheared, or faulted.

(o) Considering deck loading where appropriate to avoid broken ground or cavities in the
face (e.g., from back break).

J6.4 Blasting complaints

Complaints arising from blasting operations should be treated sensitively and in a manner
that recognizes the potential for blasting to cause environmental impacts. Such impacts fall
under the jurisdiction of a variety of regulatory authorities. Those responsible for each
blasting operation must be aware of the regulatory regime pertinent to that operation. In any
case, they need to act in the best interests of all stakeholders, including neighbours of the
mine, quarry or construction project.

Many complaints resulting from blasting in built-up areas are mistakenly attributed to
ground vibration. The actual problem is usually airblast, which can be controlled by
blasting technique.

Those responsible for blasting operations should ensure that relevant personnel and persons
who may be affected by the blast are consulted and advised on the nature, causes and
effects of airblast from blasting and the difference between it and ground vibration. They
should also recognize the importance of monitoring blasts as a tool for minimizing
complaints as well as investigating complaints. It is in the interest of all those concerned in
a blasting operation to monitor blasting operations in the event of any claims for damages
arising from blasting.

Where the blast operation is in an environmentally sensitive area, all blasts should be
monitored.

Records of any complaints associated with blasting should be kept, identifying the nature of
the complaint, the particular operation that initiated the complaint, and documenting the
action taken.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

115 AS 2187.2--2006

Any complaints related to blasting should be immediately investigated and a genuine
endeavour made to satisfy the concerns raised by the complainant. Those responsible for the
blasting operation should act swiftly, undertake follow-up visits and provide feedback to
the complainant as to the cause of the problem and what is being done to rectify it.

Many complaints from blasting can be avoided by the adoption of the control measures
listed in Paragraphs J6.2 and J6.3 and Table J6.1.

Upon receipt of a complaint, an appropriate investigation should establish the nature of the
complaint, the cause of the incident and any response. Independent professional or technical
advice may need to be sought.

J7 ESTIMATION OF GROUND VIBRATION AND AIRBLAST LEVELS

J7.1 Introduction

The accurate estimation of ground vibration and airblast levels is a complex task. The
blasting process is highly non-linear and the variability of most rock types also contributes
to the difficulty in accurate predictions of the environmental outcomes. The random
character of the blasting outcomes suggests the need for probability distributions to
describe strictly the range of possible ground vibration and airblast levels.

In the absence of either field data or the opportunity to conduct blasting trials in the region
of interest, it is possible to estimate likely ground vibration and airblast levels using simple
charge weight scaling laws. Such laws incorporate the charge weight per delay and the
distance from the blast to the monitoring location. Two site parameters are assumed and
these influence the peak level and the rate of decay for the levels.

J7.2 Airblast overpressure

Airblast levels have been commonly estimated using the following cube root scaling
formula:

a . . . J7.2

 R 
= K a  [] 1/ 3  []

 R 

 [] 1/ 3  []
 Q 

a

R
P = K a  [] 1/ 3  []

 Q 

where

P = pressure, in kilopascals

Q = explosives charge mass, in kilograms

R = distance from charge, in metres

K a = site constant

a = site exponent

For unconfined surface charges, in situations that are not affected by meteorological
conditions, a good estimate may be obtained by using a site exponent (a) of −1.45, (which
corresponds to an attenuation rate of 8.6 dBL with doubling of distance), and a site constant
(K a ) of 516.

For confined blasthole charges, when using a site exponent (a) of −1.45, the site constant
(K a ) is commonly in the range 10 to 100.

Airblast is proportional to the cube root of the charge mass. This limits the effectiveness of
charge mass reduction as a method of reducing airblast levels; other factors are often more
important, especially for confined blasthole charges.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 116

In unfavourable meteorological conditions, it is common for airblast levels to be increased
by up to 20 dBL due to the combined effects of an increase with altitude of temperature (an
inversion) and/or wind velocity (windshear). Effective assessment of meteorological
reinforcement requires accurate measurement of temperature, wind speed, and wind
direction, generally at heights up to 1000 m above the ground.

J7.3 Ground vibration

It is useful to be able to estimate the ground vibration expected from any particular blasting
operations. As many site factors will affect the transmission of vibration through the
ground, the most accurate prediction graph for a site will be that generated from vibration
measurements take at the site. However, in the absence of such site data, ground vibration
may be estimated using the following equation:

 R 

 [] 1/ 2  []
 Q 

 R  −
= K . . . J7.3(1)
g  [] 1/ 2  []

−

B

R
V = K

g  [] 1/

 Q

 []


Where

V = ground vibration as vector peak particle velocity, in millimetres per second

R = distance between charge and point of measurement, in metres

Q = maximum instantaneous charge (effective charge mass per delay), in
kilograms

K g, B = constants related to site and rock properties for estimation purposes

Ground vibration levels depend on the maximum instantaneous charge (effective charge
weight per delay), and not the total charge weight, provided the effective delay interval is
appropriate.

When blasting is to be carried out to a free face in average field conditions, the following
equation may be used to estimate the mean (50% probability of exceedence) vector peak
particle velocity:

 R 

 [] 1/ 2  []
 Q 

 R  −
V = 1140 . . . J7.3(2)

 [] 1/ 2  []
 Q 

1140

 1/ 2

 []


Equation J7.3(2) is represented in graphical form in Figure J7.3.1 and in tabular form in
Table J7.3.1.

NOTE: Equation J7.3(2) and Table J7.3.1 and Figure J7.3.1 (which uses a site constant of
K g = 1140, and a site exponent of B = 1.6), will provide an estimate of vibration levels in
‘average’ conditions. In practice, due to variations in ground conditions and other factors, the
resulting ground vibration levels can vary from two-fifths to four times that estimated. In cases
where the site parameters have not been reliably determined from prior experience, advice should
be obtained from suitably qualified and experienced persons, who may recommend initial trial
blasts with conservative charge quantities.

APPENDIX K

DEMOLITION OF STRUCTURES

(Informative)

K1 GENERAL

The application of explosives for structural demolition requires extensive planning and
preparatory work and should only be performed by competent persons. This Appendix is
not intended to provide procedures for explosive demolition but rather recommendations to
be considered in the interests of health, safety and welfare of persons, property and the
environment.

K2 PRINCIPAL CONSIDERATIONS

The principal considerations in structural demolition are achieving the intended collapse
mechanism, the safety of persons, property and the environment, and the minimization of--

(a) fly;

(b) airblast overpressure;

(c) dust;

(d) ground vibration; and

(e) ground compression or ground penetration from parts of the collapsing structure.

Some examples of what may influence any intended use of explosives include--

(i) materials of construction;

(ii) services, e.g., water, gas, electricity, sewerage, drainage, communications, subways
on, below or adjacent to the site;

(iii) adjacent buildings or structures--

(A) buildings housing sensitive equipment;

(B) hospitals, nursing or retirement homes;

(C) animal or wildlife shelters, stables, veterinary hospitals, zoos;

(D food processing establishments; and

(E) heritage items.

(iv) occupants of adjoining buildings;

(v) adjoining dangerous goods plants or storages, e.g., flammables, chemicals;

(vi) adjacent transport systems including roads, railways, waterways and flight paths; and

(vii) public places.

K3 NOTIFICATION

The following may need to be notified:

(a) Regulatory authorities having jurisdiction.

(b) Emergency services including Police, Ambulance and Fire.

(c) Gas supply.

(d) Electrical supply.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 120

(e) Telecommunications.

(f) Sewerage, drainage and water supply.

(g) Transportation system authorities.

(h) Fisheries or inland waters.

(i) Adjacent property owners and occupants who may be affected by the blast.

As part of the planning process, Police should always be informed. As the usual first line
recipients of complaints or reports regarding a disturbance such as those created by
explosive demolition, it is imperative they be aware of work of this nature.

K4 EXAMINATION OF THE STRUCTURE

As part of the planning process, structural drawings, where available, should be examined
and the materials of construction confirmed by physical examination or testing or both. The
preparatory work for each structure will vary considerably. Supporting documentation from
a structural engineer should be obtained to identify the key members providing the stability
to the structure and the effect on structural or load-bearing members when altered, cut,
weakened or removed. Particular attention should be paid to the following:

(a) Location of all gas, water, electrical, and communication services that may require
disconnection.

(b) Identification of all asbestos and asbestiform material including asbestos-cement
sheeting.

(c) Identification of materials that may plane or glide if they break free, e.g., roofing,
iron, cladding, panes of glass.

(d) Identification of construction of non-structural walls, beams, and the like that may
interfere with the intended line of fall or collapse.

K5 EXAMINATION OF THE SURROUNDING AREA

As part of the planning process, the area surrounding the structure should be examined.
This area or zone also includes the area within site boundaries under the control of the

demolition contractor as well as the area outside the site boundaries. The purpose of the
examination is to identify critical facilities or services that might be adversely affected by
the demolition and are situated below, at or above the surface. The shape of the zone will
approximate a hemisphere depending on the topography of the environment. The actual size
of the area to be considered will be dependent on the type of structure and materials of
construction, intended collapse mechanism, type of charges and initiation delay system,
likely fly projections, airblast overpressure predictions, type of structures and facilities in
the surrounding area, and potential for spectator viewing points. It is probable that the
examination will require consultation with regulatory authorities, local government
agencies, police and emergency service providers, energy and communication system
providers, transport agencies, owners and occupiers of surrounding properties, and interest
groups including those who may be opposed to the demolition. Considerations should
include, but not be limited to, the following:

(a) Flight corridors and flight schedules.

(b) Surface transport corridors including routes that may need to be closed during the
demolition and the effect this will have on emergency service vehicles and special
services such as school buses.

(c) Maritime corridors and waterways.

(d) Location and type of energy systems including monitoring or control stations.

121 AS 2187.2--2006

(e) Identification of facilities that may need to be evacuated or cannot be evacuated such
as hospitals.

(f) Identification of structures that have critical responses to ground or water vibrations
such as dams, power generation systems, hospitals, high-rise buildings and pre- or
post-stressed concrete structures such as bridges.

(g) Identification of walking tracks, likelihood of spectators and potential viewing points.

(h) Identification of areas containing livestock or animal refuges.

The key outcome will be to identify whether the surrounding area can be secured and then
controlled for the duration of the demolition.

K6 DEMOLITION BLAST PLAN

The demolition blast plan, which may form part of an overall demolition workplan, should
include, but not be limited to, the following:

(a) Name and location of the project and relevant permits/licence.

(b) Location of the proposed blasting.

(c) Identification and position of the person responsible for the project including project
safety.

(d) Identification and position of person who has given approval to use explosives on the

K7 CONTINGENCY PLANNING

A contingency plan is prepared in case the operation does not proceed as planned. This
should take account of personnel evacuated from nearby properties and road closures. Also
the provision of standby plant, equipment, additional explosives and material used to
contain fly in case the structure does not collapse as intended or a misfire occurs.
Contingency plans should be discussed at the planning stage.

K8 EXPLOSIVES

Attention should be paid to the following:

(a) Using only appropriate explosives and techniques designed for a specified task as
recommended by the manufacturer.

(b) Using a proven powder factor, noting that a structural member that is not cut,
removed or weakened as intended can interfere with the intended collapse
mechanism.

(c) Conducting a test shot to ascertain the strength/suitability/powder factor of an
explosive for its designated task.

(d) Providing adequate cover around the charges to prevent/minimize fly of debris and
airblast.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

123 AS 2187.2--2006

K9 INITIATION SYSTEMS

Particular attention should be paid to the following:

(a) Where delays are required, using only electric or signal tube initiation systems.

(b) Not using signal tube initiation if there is a possibility of the signal tube being
severed by fly from an earlier blast before the signal reaches the detonator.

(c) Not using detonating cord in conjunction with delays.

(d) Not using safety fuse to provide delays.

(e) Ensuring all detonators and their primers are protected, cannot be separated from each
other and that the units cannot be dislodged by airblast, fly or structure movement.

(f) Using a back-up (second) initiation system to positively ensure initiation of all the
charges, e.g., with electrical initiation, two series circuits connected in parallel; with
signal tube, using a second circuit initiated simultaneously with the primary circuit.

APPENDIX L

EXCLUSION ZONES

(Normative)

L1 GENERAL

All blasts require the establishment of an exclusion or evacuation zone prior to firing the
shot. Depending on the industry, the zone can be the area, below, at and above ground level,
from which all unauthorized persons are excluded to protect them from injury or harm.

The size of the exclusion zone shall be such that all fly and associated debris is contained
within the zone, as well as consideration on impacts of blast environmental limits on
humans and where required, animals.

The effects of dust should be minimized.

An exclusion zone can comprise an inner zone, which is established prior to the
commencement of loading the shot, and an outer zone that adjoins the boundary of the inner
zone, and is established prior to the final connections being made or programming of
electronic detonators. The purpose of the inner zone is to allow work to continue in
surrounding areas during loading, but must be controlled to prevent unauthorized access of
personnel, plant and equipment.

The inner zone shall be identified by being cordoned off with flagging tape, flags, hazard
blast cones, berms, signage or other suitable means visible at all times to restrict
unauthorized entry.

The shotfirer and authorized persons may remain in the exclusion zone, at a predetermined
protected location during firing. Final approval for persons to observe or monitor the shot
from within an exclusion zone remains with the shotfirer, who should not be subject to any
external pressure.

L2 PLANNING

The requirements for an exclusion zone shall be a component of the blast management plan.
The degree of planning will be dependent on the industry, for instance the ventilation
system of an underground mine will influence an exclusion zone in three dimensions.

For blasting operations where the zone is contained within property boundaries (subject to
airspace clearances) or underground, standard procedures may be developed and
implemented for each blast.

For blasting operations where the zone is on or extends onto neighbouring property, each
blast will be unique and the feasibility of establishing an exclusion zone that extends
beyond the site boundary shall be investigated. This may require liaison with project
management staff, regulatory authorities, emergency service providers, local landowners,
transport authorities (land, maritime and air), energy service providers, and any other
affected body. The effect on animals shall be considered, as noise from a blast can cause
distress resulting in injury or death. Existing facilities and energy systems within the
exclusion zone may need to be protected as fly can cause significant damage. Approvals
from regulatory bodies and other authorities may be required.

If a zone of the required size cannot be established and controlled for the expected
timeframe, then another method of carrying out the task shall be considered.

 Standards Australia www.standards.com.au

125 AS 2187.2--2006

L3 SIZE OF THE EXCLUSION ZONE

The size of the exclusion zone is directly related to the blasting activity and the surrounding
environment. For example, an exclusion zone for structural demolition would differ
considerably to a remote agricultural blast and similarly for underground or maritime work.

The distance required to limit airblast overpressure to tolerable levels can be estimated, but
the distance for fly can be difficult to predict and can vary from site to site. Therefore a
competent person shall determine the size of the zone, in many cases through extensive
consultation with other stakeholders. The zone may be larger than the calculated size to
make use of control points such as transport junctions, or elevated areas that provide clear
lines of observation.

On public roads when deciding the location of traffic control points, areas that are difficult
for impatient drivers to bypass once stopped shall be identified. Examples of such bypasses
include the potential to move to another lane or drive across the median strip to another
carriageway and then drive through the exclusion zone. Temporary barriers may be
insufficient to stop such drivers and physical blockages such as plant may be necessary. The
control point shall be sited so that there is adequate stopping sight distance for drivers,
enhanced by the use of warning signs. A minimum of two people should be assigned to each
traffic control point with one person moving along the stationary line of traffic to inform
drivers how long the delay is likely to be. Where alternative routes allow safe bypass of the
exclusion zone, signs shall be erected prior to the junction.

For contract work, the contract documentation should include the requirements for an
exclusion zone, but distances should not be stipulated unless they have been determined by
a competent person and are known to be achievable within the surrounding area.

L4 ESTABLISHING AND DISESTABLISHING THE ZONE

Written procedures shall be developed for the establishment and disestablishment of the
exclusion zone. Content, where applicable, should include, but not be limited to the
following:

(a) A description of the zone and method of implementation.

(b) Details of organizations involved.

(c) A list of key personnel outlining tasks and responsibilities.

(d) A list of other personnel, outlining tasks and responsibilities.

(e) A description of the means of communication.

(f) A procedure to control radio transmissions that may influence the communication or
security of the shot.

(g) Timings and procedures for notification of agencies on-site and off-site such as
emergency service providers.

(h) A procedure to activate in the event of inclement weather or lightning.

(i) Identification of the location of, and the method of manning of, control points.

(j) Procedures to clear areas such as public roadside rest areas, toilets and underside of
bridges that are located within the zones.

(k) A method to establish and notify the shotfirer that the inner and outer zones have
been cleared.

(l) A method to control livestock or wildlife.

(m) Identification of, and contact details for, liaison with bodies who control the approval
to fire, such as air traffic control.

www.standards.com.au  Standards Australia

AS 2187.2--2006 126

(n) Procedures for passage of emergency vehicles such as police, fire and ambulance.

(o) Procedures for immediate notification of and dealing with trespassers.

(p) Warning procedures prior to firing.

(q) Procedures to remove fly or debris that may fall on roads or other areas.

(r) Procedures for misfires.

(s) Safety and security procedures for the shot remaining loaded overnight.

(t) A procedure to identify that fumes have cleared to safe levels in underground work

areas.

(u) A method of notification to return the whole of the exclusion zone to normal.

(v) A method of notification to disestablish the outer zone, only.

Site briefings shall be conducted for personnel involved with the establishment and
disestablishment of an exclusion zone. If different organizations provide personnel, the
same pool of people should be used when the operation involves blasting over a period of
time. Rehearsals should also be considered.

When a shot cannot be initiated and is to remain loaded overnight, the firing circuit shall be
made safe. Under these circumstances the exclusion zone can be based on the inner zone

provided the area is secured prior to returning the outer zone to normal. When a site
requires guarding, personnel other than the shotfirer and crew, shall be engaged to ensure
that the shotfirer has sufficient rest prior to firing the next day. Such personnel shall be
briefed on hazards and a procedure for contacting a responsible person in the case of
trespass.

The exclusion zone should not be returned to normal until the ‘all clear’ for the blasting
operation is given by the shotfirer.

L5 SPECTATORS

The use of explosives in some industries can attract spectators and possibly demonstrators
along with strong media involvement. Such possibilities shall be considered for the control
and size of the exclusion zone. It is important that control is established and maintained at
all levels of the project and the blasting operation should not be promoted as a public
display.

For surface work it may be preferable to fire on weekdays rather than a weekend or near a
public holiday, as this may reduce the potential for spectators. Where the operation is
adjacent to a school bus route, the shot should be fired by early afternoon to avoid delays.
In addition, support can be more readily obtained if a difficulty arises, e.g., a misfire.

Where notification has to be given in advance to the public, such as road closures, it is
preferable for reasons of security not to mention the use of explosives. Similarly, if the
method of firing does not involve electric detonators, signage on explosives relating to
transmitters may not be required.
