#### _I. Reason for Guidance_

The mineral handling and processing industry is the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management
District’s (District) dominant industry in terms of emissions, number of permit units, and
revenue. The mineral industry performs a number of characteristic operations associated with
extracting minerals from the Earth’s crust and processing them. Aside from equipment and
material differences, these operations and processes are essentially the same from facility to
facility. Accordingly, the District has prepared this document to ensure that these common
operations and processes have their emissions estimated consistently throughout the region.

Why is the District concerned with consistency? Two reasons: accuracy and fairness. The
District emissions inventory as a whole will be more accurate if every process of a given type
has its emissions estimated using the same methodology (as opposed to a myriad of methods of
unknown or questioned accuracy). Actions taken by the District that depend on the emissions
inventory (such as attainment plans and the rules that implement them) will be fairly applied if
all processes are represented in the emissions inventory to the same extent.

This attempt to impose regularity and claim to improve accuracy should not be construed as a
criticism of existing inventories or methodologies. On the contrary, District staff greatly
appreciates the efforts of the many individuals who have created the existing methodologies and
used them to estimate emissions. Nor does District staff claim to have the most accurate

inventory; rather, District staff are attempting to establish a minimum level of known accuracy.
Methods more accurate than those presented herein will be accepted.

#### _II. Background_

Federal and State law requires air districts to prepare and maintain as accurate and current an
emissions inventory as possible. This inventory must include criteria (oxides of nitrogen,
volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, oxides of sulfur, particulate matter, and lead),
hazardous, and toxic air pollutants. The emissions inventory is used to determine attainment
strategies, progress towards clean air goals, and air quality relative to other districts.

#### _III. Approach of this Guidance_

This guidance will present methodologies for a large number of emissions-generating operations
and processes. The methodologies will be provided with several levels of increasing complexity
and accuracy; each level of increased complexity will require greater input (and effort) from the
user. In practice, this means that an equation is provided for each process, with a variety of
default equation inputs specified. At the lowest level of complexity, an emission factor is
specified that can simply be multiplied by a process activity rate.

The greatest level of complexity and accuracy involves the use of data from a source test (if
feasible). Of course, the District would prefer all emission inventories to be based on source test
results or continuous emission monitor (CEMS) data. This is not feasible due to obvious cost
and time constraints. However, a properly performed and documented source test (and/or CEMS
data) provides the greatest accuracy possible, and represents a method that will always be
accepted in lieu of a methodology presented herein. Other methods may be accepted, if they
have been documented and approved by the District.

This guidance document is accompanied by a set of electronic spreadsheets that contains each of
the equations used in these methodologies. This allows the user to ‘plug-in’ her local values and
calculates her local result.

#### _IV. Source Test Data_

For a source test to be used to generate an emission factor, it must include additional emissionsand activity-related information. The following can be considered required supplemental
elements for a source test report that is submitted to support or generate a set of equipmentspecific emission factors.

A. Process flow diagram that specifies pickup points
B. Control equipment description that defines operational parameters during test (such as
water use or pressure drop).
C. Throughput during test in hourly units (or shorter term units), including a discussion of
maximum design throughput, average throughput, and actual throughput during the test.
D. Exhaust concentrations and mass emission rates, including front half, back half, and total

November 4, 1999 Page 2 of 31 Mineral Guidance2013

emissions. The concentrations and mass rates should identify values for total
hydrocarbon, reactive organic gases and volatile organic compounds. The concentrations
and mass rates should also identify values for total suspended particulate, particulate 10
microns and less, and particulate 2.5 microns and less.

#### _V. Calculation Spreadsheet Accessory_

An accessory spreadsheet has been prepared for this document. The spreadsheet contains each
of the equations referenced in the guidance. The equations are programmed into input and
output spreadsheet cells to assist the user. The spreadsheet was prepared in Microsoft Excel, and
two versions are available. The spreadsheet is titled “Mineral Guidance Equations” and is in
Microsoft Excel 97 format. The version titled “Mineral Guidance Equations 95” is in Microsoft
Excel 95 format.

The spreadsheet is in the format of a multiple-worksheet workbook, with a separate worksheet
for each method (the worksheets have individual tabs at the lower left). Those values which can
be entered by the user are defined in dark blue, and the cells in which the values can be typed
have a turquoise background. Selected turquoise cells may have a value pre-entered; these
values are the District default values, and can be replaced by a known local value. After all
necessary turquoise cells have a value, the results of the equation are automatically calculated
(the user may need to hit the ‘enter’ key after entering the last value). In each case the calculated
values are displayed in units of pounds and tons of the applicable pollutants.

Please contact District emissions inventory staff if you encounter any problems or errors with the
calculation spreadsheet accessory.

#### _VI. Methods_

Each method will be presented in the same format. The method will begin with a detailed
discussion of the processes and operations for which it is an applicable emissions estimation
methodology. The method itself will then be provided, beginning with the most conservative
and least complex version, and followed by increasingly complex and data-intensive versions.
Each method will culminate with the complete equation (where possible), for which the user has
the option of providing all inputs. The District has prepared tables calculating likely values for
various common inputs. Each method contains a discussion of applicable control strategies
(where possible), and appropriate calculation methods for those. Each method concludes with a
source reference.

**A.** **Blast Hole Drilling**

This procedure applies to the drilling of charge holes for open pit or open shelf blasting. Note
that the activity input for the equation requires the total amount of material shifted, including,
topsoil, overburden and ore. Blast hole drilling is often performed by portable internal
combustion engine powered drills; exhaust emissions from this equipment are not accounted for
by this method. Such exhaust emissions should be estimated using methods presented
elsewhere.

“Shifted” is defined as loosened sufficiently to require removal or further handling.

_Least Complex:_

Assume negligible particulate emissions from blast hole drilling. This can only be assumed by
facilities shifting less than 50,000 tons per year of ore, overburden and topsoil combined.

_Intermediate Complexity:_

This method employs a conservative factor times the total amount of material shifted by blasting.

_E_ = _E_ _f_ [×] _Q_

E = Particulate matter emissions rate in pounds per year
E f = Emission factor in units of pounds of particulate per ton shifted by blasting
Q = Amount of material of all types shifted by blasting during the year in tons

TSP E f = 0.001 pounds/ton
PM 10 E f = 0.0008 pounds/ton
PM 2.5 E f = 0.0008 pounds/ton

_Most Complex:_

This method requires an estimate of the number of shot holes drilled on an annual basis.

_E_ = _E_ _f_ [×] _N_

E = Particulate matter emissions rate in pounds per year
E f = Emission factor in units of pounds of particulate per hole drilled
N = Number of blast holes drilled per year

November 4, 1999 Page 4 of 31 Mineral Guidance2013

TSP E f = 1.3 pounds/hole
PM 10 E f = 0.68 pounds/hole
PM 2.5 E f = 0.68 pounds/hole

_Control Techniques:_

None are presently quantified. The methods assume a wet drilling operation. Enclosures, air
return or other control strategies can be employed for an estimated control efficiency, subject to
District review and approval.

_Source:_

The intermediate complexity method employs a low confidence emission factor presented in
Chapter 15 of the Air & Waste Management Association Air Pollution Engineering Manual,
1992 edition (Stone and Quarrying Processing). The high complexity method employs a
relatively highly rated emission factor derived from overburden drilling operations at western
surface coal mines presented in §11.9 of USEPA’s AP-42 (January 1995 reformatted version).

November 4, 1999 Page 5 of 31 Mineral Guidance2013

**B.** **Dust Entrainment from Blasting**

This procedure applies to the fracturing and loosening of topsoil, ore, overburden and substrate
in open pits and open shelves through the use of explosives. Note that activity rates for this
method require the total amount of material shifted through the use of blasting, including topsoil,
overburden and ore. “Shifted” is defined as loosened sufficiently to require removal or further
handling.

_Least Complex:_

This method employs a conservative factor times the total amount of material shifted by blasting.

_E_ = _E_ _f_ [×] _B_

E = Particulate matter emissions rate in pounds per year
E f = Emission factor in units of pounds of particulate per ton shifted by blasting
B = Amount of material of all types shifted by blasting during the year in tons

E f (TSP) = 0.16 pounds/ton
E f (PM 10 ) = 0.08 pounds/ton
E f (PM 2.5 ) = 0.08 pounds/ton

_Most Complex:_

This method requires information on the horizontal area shifted by blasting, and the number of
such blasts performed during the year. This method cannot be used if blasting depth exceeds 70
feet.

5.1
_E_ = _k_ × _N_ × .00005 × _A_

E = Particulate matter emissions rate in pounds per year
k = Particulate matter size factor

N = Number of blasts per year
A = Horizontal area shifted by each blast in square feet

k (TSP) = 1.00
k (PM 10 ) = 0.52
k (PM 2.5 ) = 0.52

_Control Techniques:_

None are presently quantified. The method does not assume any emission reducing procedures.
Certain control techniques are available, such as blast blankets. Control strategies can be
employed for an estimated control efficiency, subject to District review and approval.

The most complex method employs a poorly rated emission factor derived from blasting
operations at western surface coal mines presented in §11.9 of USEPA’s AP-42 (January 1995

**C.** **Criteria Emissions from Blasting Explosives**

This procedure estimates the criteria pollutants generated by the detonation of explosives for
blasting. This is a “least complex” method that multiplies an emission factor by the total amount
of explosives detonated in a year.

_E_ = _E_ _f_ [×] _A_

E = Pollutant emissions rate in pounds per year

Note that VOC emissions are considered negligible for all explosives. TSP, PM 10 and PM 2.5
emissions are subsumed within the dust entrainment estimations.

**D.** **Bulldozing, Scraping and Grading of Materials**

This procedure applies to the bulldozing, scraping and grading of topsoil, overburden, waste
material, and ore through the use of heavy equipment such as bulldozers, graders, scrapers, etc.
This procedure does not apply to the lifting and dumping of said materials; such lifting and
dumping emissions should be estimated using methods presented elsewhere.

_Least Complex:_

This method applies a conservative factor times the annual hours of operation.

_E_ = _E_ _f_ [×] _T_

E = Particulate matter emissions rate in pounds per year
E f = Emission factor in units of pounds of particulate per hour of operation
T = Annual activity in hours

TSP E f = 886 pounds/hour
PM 10 E f = 431 pounds/hour
PM 2.5 E f = 132 pounds/hour
(These emission factors were calculated using the defaults given in the Most Complex section)

_Control Techniques:_

Water spray is commonly used to reduce fugitive dust from this type of activity. Water spray
essentially increases the moisture content of the material. Therefore, to take credit for the use of

November 4, 1999 Page 10 of 31 Mineral Guidance2013

water spray as an emissions control technique, measure the moisture content of the material
when being actively moistened and use this value in the method.

Particulate emissions can also be reduced through the use of wind screens or enclosures (on a
relatively small scale). The District assumes that complete coverage by wind screens (on the
windward side) will provide a control efficiency of 75 percent.

_Source:_

The method is derived from the Western Surface Coal Mining discussion in §11.9 of USEPA’s
AP-42 (January 1995 reformatted version).

**E.** **Material Handling Operations**

This procedure applies to the handling of materials in batches and conveyor belts, including
loading, unloading, transferring and dropping. “Materials” include topsoil, overburden, waste
material and ore. This procedure specifically applies to the operation of heavy equipment such
as front end loaders and shovels as well as conveyor belts. This procedure is intended to be
applied to each material handling point. This means that each batch drop should be counted. For
example, a loader dropping a quantity of material into a temporary storage pile, then dropping
into a dump truck, then the dump truck dumping into a long term storage pile would be three
separate operations which should be separately accounted for.

_Least Complex:_

This method multiplies a conservative factor by the total amount of material moved in a year.

_E_ = _E_ _f_ [×] _Q_

E = Particulate matter emissions rate in pounds per year
E f = Emission factor in units of pounds of particulate per ton handled
Q = Quantity of material handled per year in tons

TSP E f = 0.029 pounds/ton
PM 10 E f = 0.014 pounds/ton
PM 2.5 E f = 0.004 pounds/ton
(These emission factors were calculated using the defaults given in the Most Complex section)

Note that higher baghouse control efficiencies can be justified with source tests, permit
conditions and/or design factors.

Particulate emissions can also be reduced through the use of wind screens or enclosures (on a
relatively small scale). The District assumes that complete coverage by wind screens (on the
windward side) will provide a control efficiency of 75 percent.

Once the control efficiency of the applicable control technique is known, the following equation
is used to determine the “controlled” emissions from the operation or process:

−
 100 _C_ 
_E_ _c_ = _E_ ×  100 

E c = Controlled emissions
E = Uncontrolled emissions

C = Control efficiency in percent (%)

**F.** **Material Crushing and Screening Operations**

This procedure applies to the crushing and screening of materials. This is effectively a “least
complex” method that multiplies an emission factor by annual throughput. This method applies
to each occurrence of a crushing or screening operation; in a process line with primary crushing
and a screen, secondary crushing and a screen, and tertiary crushing followed by a screen, this
method should be applied six times (to six potentially different throughputs).

_E_ = _E_ _f_ [×] _T_

E = Particulate matter emissions rate in pounds per year
E f = Emission factor in units of pounds of particulate per ton of throughput

**G.** **Wind Erosion From Stockpiles**

This procedure applies to wind erosion from open storage piles.

_Least Complex:_

This method employs a conservative emission factor multiplied by the surface area of a
stockpile.

_E_ = _E_ _f_ [×] _A_

E = Particulate matter emissions rate in tons per year
E f = Emission factor in units of tons of particulate per surface acre
A = Exposed surface area of stockpile in acres

TSP E f = 8.10 tons/acre
PM 10 E f = 4.05 tons/acre
PM 2.5 E f = 1.62 tons/acre
(These emission factors were calculated using the defaults given in the Most Complex section)

This method presents an equation requiring inputs for the silt content of the stockpiled material,
the average number of days during the year in question that experienced at least 0.01 inches of
precipitation, the percentage of time during the year that the unobstructed wind speed exceeded
12 mph, and the exposed surface area of the stockpile.

_Control Techniques:_

Fugitive particulate emissions from storage piles can be reduced through the use of water spray
(by increasing the moisture content of the material). The following table presents the required
minimum water application rates to achieve a given control efficiency. Water application or use
records must accompany any watering control efficiency claim.

|Stockpiles Table 6 -- Watering Control Efficiency (%)|Col2|
|---|---|
|~~**Desired Efficiency (%)**~~<br><br>|~~**Daily Water Application Rate (gal/acre)**~~<br><br>|
|~~**50**~~<br>|~~**1703**~~<br>|
|~~**60**~~<br>|~~**2390**~~<br>|
|~~**70**~~<br>|~~**3396**~~<br>|

|~~**90**~~<br>|~~**8892**~~<br>|
|~~**95**~~|~~**14279**~~|

Stockpile fugitive particulate emissions can also be reduced through the use of wind screens or
enclosures. The District assumes that complete coverage by wind screens (on the windward
side) will provide a control efficiency of 75 percent.

Once the control efficiency of the applicable control technique is known, the following equation
is used to determine the “controlled” emissions from the operation or process:

−
 100 _C_ 
_E_ _c_ = _E_ ×  100 

E c = Controlled emissions
E = Uncontrolled emissions

C = Control efficiency in percent (%)

_Source:_

The method is derived from the Fugitive Emissions discussion in the Air & Waste Management
Association Air Pollution Engineering Manual (1992 edition).

**H.** **Stationary Equipment Exhaust**

This procedure estimates exhaust from a wide variety of fuel-burning stationary equipment used
in the mineral industry. This is a “least complex” method that multiplies an emission factor by
annual fuel use, and should be used only if source test or manufacturer guaranteed emissions data
is not available for the equipment in question. This method requires fuel type and annual fuel
use as inputs. Boilers, Space Heaters, Generic Industrial Process Heaters, Internal Combustion
Engines, and Gas Turbines are covered by this method.

**I.** **Mobile Equipment and Vehicular Exhaust**

This procedure estimates the exhaust and brake wear emissions from a variety of mobile
equipment common in the mineral industry. Note that this method estimates exhaust from
mobile equipment only, and dust entrainment due to the travel of mobile equipment on paved
and unpaved surfaces should be estimated using the methods presented elsewhere in this
document. This is effectively a “least complex” method that multiplies a conservative emission
factor by annual activity in hours of use, fuel consumption in 1000’s of gallons, or travel in
1000’s of miles.

**J.** **Dust Entrainment from Paved Roads**

This procedure applies to all traffic on paved roads. This procedure estimates the dust
entrainment due to vehicular travel on paved surfaces. Vehicular exhaust emissions should be
estimated using methods presented elsewhere.

_Least Complex:_

This method consists of multiplying a conservative default emission factor for a typical haul
truck operating on a material laden surface by an estimate of that haul trucks annual activity in
vehicle mile traveled.

_E_ = _E_ _f_ [×] _V_

E = Particulate matter emissions rate in pounds per year
E f = Emission factor in units of pounds of pollutant per mile traveled
V = Annual travel in units of vehicle miles traveled

E f (TSP) = 55 pounds/mile traveled
E f (PM 10 ) = 11 pounds/mile traveled
E f (PM 2.5 ) = 3 pounds/mile traveled
(These emission factors were calculated using the defaults given in the Most Complex section)

_Control Techniques:_

Several control techniques are effective in reducing dust entrainment emissions from paved
surfaces. Broom sweeping provides a 20 percent control effectiveness. Vacuum sweeping with
at least a 12,000 cfm blower provides 45 percent control effectiveness (30 percent for PM 10 and
PM 2.5 ). Water flushing can also be used, but at least 0.48 gallons per square yard (or 8448
gallons per mile of 30 foot road) must be used to qualify for the following control efficiencies:

**K.** **Dust Entrainment from Unpaved Roads**

This procedure applies to all traffic on unpaved roads. This procedure estimates the dust
entrainment due to vehicular travel on unpaved surfaces. Vehicular exhaust emissions should be
estimated using methods presented elsewhere.

_Least Complex:_

This method consists of a conservative default emission factor (based on average vehicle weight
in tons) multiplied by an estimate of annual vehicular activity in miles traveled.

_E_ = _E_ _f_ [×] _V_

E = Particulate matter emissions rate in pounds per year
E f = Emission factor in units of pounds of particulate per mile traveled
V = Annual travel in units of vehicle miles traveled

(These emission factors were calculated using the defaults given in the Most Complex section)

Conservative default silt content is 11 percent
Conservative default surface moisture content is 0.2 percent
Default average vehicle speed is assumed to be at least 15 mph

_Control Techniques:_

Several techniques are used to reduce fugitive dust emissions from vehicular travel on unpaved
roads. The equation suggests that reducing travel, speed, and vehicle weight will directly reduce
emissions. In addition, changing the nature of the unpaved surface can reduce emissions, as can
be seen from the default silt loading table. Chemical stabilization is often used, but the control
efficiency of chemical stabilization is very dependent on the material used and how it is applied;
consult with the vendor and the District to derive a control efficiency for chemical stabilization
(no control efficiency will be allowed for calcium chloride). Watering is the most common
control technique for unpaved roads. What follows is an equation to calculate the control
efficiency for a given water application rate:

_C_ _f_ = 100 −  .00012 × _A_ × _D_ × _T_ 
 _I_ 

C f = Control efficiency of watering application in percent
A = Average annual class A pan evaporation in inches
D = Average hourly traffic rate in vehicles per hour
T = Time between water applications in hours
I = Water application intensity in gallons per square yard

Conservative average annual evaporation is 75 inches
Conservative time between applications is 3 hours
Conservative watering intensity is 0.11 gal/yd [2] or 1936 gallons per mile of 30 foot road
(These defaults equate to no control efficiency for 41 vehicles per hour)

Once the control efficiency of the applicable control technique is known, the following equation

November 4, 1999 Page 26 of 31 Mineral Guidance2013

is used to determine the “controlled” emissions from the operation or process:

−
100 _C_ 
_E_ _c_ = _E_ ×  100 

E c = Controlled emissions
E = Uncontrolled emissions

C = Control efficiency in percent (%)

**L.** **Wind Erosion from Unpaved Operational Areas and Roads**

This procedure applies to actively disturbed unpaved areas, specifically including plant or
operational areas (such as quarries) and roads. Actively disturbed is defined as being disturbed
by man’s activity at least once per day. This procedure estimates the particulate emissions from
these areas due to wind erosion. Particulate emissions due to actual vehicular travel on these

areas should be estimated using methods presented elsewhere.

_Least Complex:_

This method multiplies a conservative emission factor by the amount of disturbed area.

_E_ = _E_ _f_ [×] _A_

E = Particulate matter emission rate in tons per year
E f = Emission factor in tons per acre (see below)
A = Disturbed area in acres

E f (TSP) = 16 tons/acre
E f (PM 10 ) = 8 tons/acre
E f (PM 2.5 ) = 3.2 tons/acre

_Most Complex:_

This method presents an additional equation that is used as an alternative depending on the
nature of the surface being eroded. Erodible surfaces can be characterized as “limited” or
“unlimited” reservoirs of erodible material. The following table determines the type of surface
and the appropriate equation:

November 4, 1999 Page 29 of 31 Mineral Guidance2013

|Wind Erosion Table 5 -- Limited vs Unlimited|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Variable|Limited<br>Unlimited<br><br>~~Reservoir Type~~<br>|Limited<br>Unlimited<br><br>~~Reservoir Type~~<br>|
|Surface cover<br>|Stones and/or clumps of vegetation<br>|~~Bare with finely divided materials~~<br>such as sand or soil<br>|
|~~Threshold Frictional~~<br>Velocity|~~Greater than 75 cm/s with particle~~<br>size 1.5 mm or greater<br>|~~Equal to or less than 75 cm/s with~~<br>particle size less than 1.5 mm|
|Surface crust|~~Crust thicker than 0.25 inch and not~~<br>easily crumbled between fingers<br>(modulus of rupture > one bar)|Crust less than 0.25 inch or easily<br>crumbled between fingers|

If the surface in question is best characterized as an “unlimited” reservoir, use the moderate
complexity method above.

The method for limited reservoirs involves a summation of the particulate emissions from each
individual day in the year, based on each day’s maximum wind speed in meters per second and
the friction velocity of the surface in question. Those days without sufficient wind speed are
ignored.

_Control Techniques:_

Water spray is commonly used to reduce fugitive dust from unpaved surfaces. Water spray
essentially increases the moisture content of the material. The control discussion presented in
the previous section (unpaved roads) includes a method for estimating the control efficiency of
watering. Other forms of stabilization can be used to reduce the erodibility of the unpaved
surface and/or increase its threshold frictional velocity. For the most part, these control
techniques will require case-by-case analysis, and review and approval of the District.
