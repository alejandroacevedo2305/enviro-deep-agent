**Retarding Performance**

To determine retarding performance: Add lengths of all downhill segments and, using this total, refer to proper retarding chart. Read from
gross weight down to the percent effective grade. Effective grade equals actual % grade minus 1% for each 10 kg/t (20 lb/ton) of rolling
resistance. From this weight-effective grade point, read horizontally to the curve with the highest obtainable gear, then down to maximum
descent speed brakes can properly handle without exceeding cooling capacity. The following charts are based on these conditions: 32° C
(90° F) ambient temperature, at sea level, with 33.00-R51 tires.

**NOTE:** Select the proper gear to maintain engine rpm at the highest possible level, without overspeeding the engine. If cooling oil
overheats, reduce ground speed to allow transmission to shift to the next lower speed range.

**Gradeability/Speed/Rimpull**

To determine gradeability performance: Read from gross weight down to the percent of total resistance. Total resistance equals
actual percent grade plus 1% for each 10 kg/t (20 lb/ton) of rolling resistance. From this weight-resistance point, read horizontally
to the curve with the highest obtainable gear, then down to maximum speed. Usable rimpull will depend upon traction available
and weight on drive wheels.
