#### Detecting Invisible Dangers

A fire can have catastrophic consequences and cost millions of dollars in business disruption and result in
the tragic loss of lives and assets. The key to fire protection is the mitigation of risk through early warning.
By detecting a fire before it escalates, an effective response can be staged.

The same principle applies to gas detection. This invisible hazard can originate from the release of toxic
gases, oxygen deficiency, or the presence of combustible gases and vapors. When detected at an early
stage, countermeasures can be initiated to protect personnel and property.

#### ASD with Gas Detection and Environmental Monitoring

As the world’s leading manufacturer of aspirating smoke detection (ASD) solutions, Xtralis is pleased to
introduce VESDA ECO, the industry’s first system to combine ASD with gas detection and environmental
monitoring. VESDA ECO:

- Leverages existing VESDA ASD pipe networks to cost effectively detect both smoke and gas in addition
to providing environmental monitoring

- Provides detection for multiple gases through simple expansion without major construction or retrofitting

- Conditions the air to remove dirt, particulates, moisture, poisonous agents, and cross-interference gases

- Suitable for harsh environments

- Provides non-intrusive detection for aesthetics or to prevent vandalism

- Enables centralized monitoring and communication with building systems for real-time awareness

#### Benefits of ASD Combined with Gas Detection and Environmental Monitoring

- 24/7 protection with active air sampling for the earliest warning of smoke and reliable gas detection

- Simplified gas detection with lower installation costs through the use of the existing VESDA ASD pipe
network

- Multiple gas-sampling points for better area coverage

- Full integration with Xtralis VSC and VSM4 software simplifies configuration and management

- Direct interface to FACP, HVAC and BMS using relays, 4-20 mA or Modbus outputs

- Reliable detection even in harsh environments

#### Built for Cost-effective Gas Monitoring Applications

In many facilities, unseen dangers exist from gases and other hazardous substances that can cause
enormous damage and loss of life. VESDA ECO was developed to provide cost-effective gas detection and
environmental monitoring in numerous applications and environments.

|UPS and Battery-charging Rooms<br>Hydrogen gas is given off during battery charging. Explosions can<br>occur due to inadequate ventilation and/or the absence of fireproof<br>equipment.<br>When hydrogen is detected, VESDA ECO can automatically<br>activate the ventilation system to prevent the build-up of explosive<br>levels of hydrogen gas. This on-demand ventilation approach<br>reduces electrical energy consumption by ventilating only when<br>potentially dangerous gases are present instead of continuously<br>ventilating the space. If hydrogen levels continue to increase, an<br>alarm can be automatically sent to notify staff of a potential system<br>malfunction so that measures can be taken to prevent a disaster.|Col2|

|**Underground Utility Tunnels**<br>Utility tunnels are the life blood of industry, supplying critical power<br>and data for operations and service continuity. A fire or gas leak in<br>these areas can lead to catastrophic consequences and cost<br>millions of dollars in disruptions and lost business.<br>Unlike conventional smoke and gas detectors that become easily<br>contaminated due to airborne dust, VESDA ECO overcomes harsh<br>environmental conditions to provide reliable detection of methane<br>(CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO) or other hazardous gases.||
|**Transportation Centers**<br>Transportation centers, like car parks, depots, road tunnels and<br>even vehicle maintenance workshops, are normally dusty and<br>exposed to potentially dangerous levels of carbon monoxide (CO)<br>or nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exhaust from vehicles.<br>VESDA ASD has been used reliably in this harsh environment to<br>provide early warning smoke detection. By adding VESDA ECO to<br>an existing VESDA ASD pipe network, high concentrations of CO<br>can be detected locally through area or zone detection as<br>compared to a fixed CO detector that provides only point<br>coverage.<br>When combined with ASD, substantial cost savings for car-park<br>operators can be achieved due to lower installation and operating<br>costs while providing a safe and healthy environment.||
