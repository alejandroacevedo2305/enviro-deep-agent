# Co-composting is a simple and inexpensive alternative for stabilizing and reducing jointly different

biodegradable waste. In this study, the feasibility of co-composting chicken manure (CM), alperujo (AL),

olive leaves/pruning (OL) and cereal straw (CS) was evaluated at full-scale. The different areas of a com
posting plant such as fermentation area, composting area and leachate lagoon, were evaluated from

physico-chemical, respirometric and olfactometric points of view. The compostable mixture was previ
ously subjected to anaerobic fermentative pretreatment to hydrolyse the non-easy biodegradable organic

matter and favour the subsequent composting process. The physico-chemical, respirometric and olfacto
metric characterization of the composted mixture showed a high-quality final product characterized by

a 57 % average organic matter content, an adequate metal content (Compost type A) and a suitable micro
biological stability (SOUR max value of 14 mmol O 2 /kg VS h), complying with current national legislation

for use as fertilizer in agriculture. Furthermore, the average global odour emission rate of the composting

plant was 5.16 ou E /kg, considering the total mass of the compostable mixture and the time required to be

treated. Finally, the leachate collected from different treatments of the compostable mixture was found

to be a stabilized waste with a nutrient content, useful for

**1.** **Introduction**

During the last 20 years, the poultry industry has increased considerably in most countries, which has led to an increase in the
generation of poultry waste. Inevitably, when increasing poultry
production, the amount of excreta is greater. Due to its composition,
this waste has been used mainly as organic fertilizer (Janczak et al.,
2017). Moreover, poultry waste has also been used as a substrate for
generating methane (Chun et al., 2015) and synthesising microbial
protein and insect larvae (Inaoka et al., 1999). However, generating poultry waste with a variety of nutrients such as nitrogen,
phosphorous, potassium and organic material causes contamina
tion of soils and water if appropriate processing is not carried out
(Li et al., 2016). Another problem derived from the generation of
poultry waste is the emission of unpleasant odours, being ammonia

(NH 3 ) the major pollutant gas emitted as a result of the microbial
degradation of uric acid (Wood et al., 2015). Moreover, it supports
the proliferation of vectors and pathogenic microorganisms, which
contribute negatively to the environment (Li et al., 2016). Therefore, it is imperative to apply new effective strategies for recycling
the waste and minimizing its adverse impact on the environment
(Whitmore, 2007).
Composting is a widely accepted method for transforming
organic waste into a stable product that is non-toxic and nonpathogenic, and it can be applied as an appropriate fertilizer and soil
conditioner to support plant growth (Huang et al., 2006). Among
organic poultry wastes, chicken manure (CM) is the most representative organic waste generated by poultry farms, both for its
volume and its characteristics. This waste is generated in large
quantities and can cause serious environmental problems if it is not
treated appropriately (Gay et al., 2003). CM contains a large amount
of nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other
micronutrients, that improve its suitability as an excellent organic
fertilizer. Despite its numerous advantages as a compostable sub

strate, it contained 50-70 % of moisture and emitted strong odour
at around 25,000 ou E /m [3] (Keck et al., 2018). Therefore, composting
this waste requires the addition of a bulking agent with the aim of
providing appropriate physical, chemical and biological properties,
air-filled porosity and an appropriate C/N ratio (range: 20-40) for
the good operation of the process (Gil et al., 2018). Previous studies
used different types of bulking agents, such as pine sawdust (Khan
et al., 2014), wheat straw (Janczak et al., 2017) or even biochar and
coffee husk (Dias et al., 2010), to increase the material porosity,
thus, improving the composting conditions, reducing unpleasant
odours and fulfilling good practices of waste stabilization (Guidoni
et al., 2018).
The olive tree is one of the main agricultural crops in Spain,
especially in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. Spain is the main
producer of olive oil in the world and there are many hectares
dedicated to this crop (INE, 2019). The importance of the olive
processing industry is well known worldwide, as is the serious
problem associated with the by-products generated olive factories.
The extraction of olive oil has led to the generation of a by-product
known as alperujo (AL). AL is composed of vegetation water, olive
pulp, solid parts of the olive (such as bone, mesocarp and skin)
and fatty remains. It has a considerable proportion of fats, pro
teins, potassium, nitrogen and hydrosoluble phenolic substances
(Alburquerque et al., 2004). Previous studies indicated that the
direct application of AL to the soil can cause nutritional imbalances, since it modifies the nitrogen cycle due to its high C/N ratio
(Thompson and Nogales, 1999). In addition, this material is considered as an important source of polyphenols which can cause
phytotoxicity in crops without preliminary decomposition (Aranda
et al., 2002) so the composting process is a possible route for its
valorisation. However, and due to its physico-chemical properties
previously mentioned, the addition of other organic materials, such
as different manures and olives leaves and pruning, are essentials
as nitrogen sources, since they are common by-products found in
olive-growing areas (Baeta-Hall et al., 2005).
The annual maintenance operations and care of olive orchards
also generate other agricultural by-products, known as olive leaves
and pruning (OL). According to its agrochemical composition, OL
belongs has an organic nature (more than 90 %), composed mainly
of lignocellulosic material. Its content in lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose and other organic fractions are high with respect to the
mineral component (Alburquerque et al., 2006).
Another important by-product derived from agricultural crops
is cereal straw (CS). CS is a lignocellulosic material composed of different fractions, such as cellulose (30-40 %), hemicellulose (20-25
%) and lignin (15-25 %), with a low biodegradability under natural
conditions (Chen, 2014). These materials have interesting physical properties that lead to consideration as proper bulking agents
in co-composting processes. In this context, the addition of small
proportions of CS as a bulking agent on performance of composting
processes have been reported in previous studies (Calabi-Floody
et al., 2019; Petric et al., 2009). However, OL has been scarcely used
for this purpose in the literature (Alfano et al., 2008; Garcia-Gómez [ ́]
et al., 2003).
Taking into account the importance of valorising high volume
waste and the need to carry out an adequate treatment that minimizes the environmental, social and economic impact, the aim of
this work was to evaluate the technical feasibility to jointly compost
CM, AL, OL and CS at full-scale, with the co-composting monitored
through physico-chemical, respirometric and olfactometric variables. To do so, a composting plant was evaluated throughout the
process (from the raw materials reception to obtaining the product) as was the final quality compost. Moreover, the odour emission
derived from the organic waste treatment was monitored to quantify the odorous impact.

### 2. Materials and methods

2.1. Description of the compostable raw materials

The composting plant (Coto Bajo) is in the province of Cordoba
(Guadalcazar, Spain), which is marked by an agricultural character.
In areas near the composting plant, there are olive fields from which
7000 tons of olive are milled and which generate about 545 tons
of OL from October to February. During olive oil extraction, the
amount of AL produced depends on the amount of olive milled
and can range between 70-80 % of the total olive milled. Thus,
4900-5600 tons of AL could be generated during this seasonal time.
CM was transported to the composting plant from three chicken
farms located in the immediate vicinity of the plant. Approximately
4 trailers per day were transported to the plant, which means
35,000 kg of CM per day or 5285 tons of CM per season. Moreover, in
adjoining areas, cereal production is highly developed and, consequently, a high amount of harvesting waste such as CS is generated.

2.2. Description of the composting plant

The composting plant consists of four different areas: reception
area, fermentation area, composting area and leachate lagoon.
The raw materials, such as CM, AL, OL and CS, were collected
in the reception area and mixed prior to transfer the fermentation
area. The mixture was carried out considering the physico-chemical
characteristics of each individual waste generated in the adjacent areas, specifically, that CM and AL provide high moisture
and require the use of a bulking agent, OL and/or CS, to improve
the porosity and the aeration of the material. Taking into account
the need to support and manage the volumes of the waste generated in the seasonal stage jointly (Section 2.1), a mixture with
CS:OL:AL:CM (1:11:44:44 vol ratio) was prepared and transferred
to the fermentation area, according to the proportion at which
they are generated. The mixture remained stored for about one
year to hydrolyse the less biodegradable organic matter through an
anaerobic fermentative process and to reduce the moisture content
before placement in composting piles under adequate conditions.
This area has a total capacity of 11,597 m [3] to store the compostable
mixture and is equipped with slopes and channels to collect the
leachate generated, which is sent by gravity to a 3420 m [3] capacity leachate lagoon where it is collected until being reused for
wetting the composting piles. The volume of the leachate lagoon
was dimensioned according to the contribution, evaporation and
rainwater influent (which is not frequent) and considering local
weather conditions. Finally, the composting area has a 4800 m [2]

surface, which is also connected to the leachate lagoon to collect
the leachate derived from the composting process. It is important
to highlight that the composting plant is located in a geographical area where rainfall is not frequent and weather conditions
are markedly constant. Thus, the different areas of the composting
plant were not covered throughout the treatments. The hydrolysis in the fermentation area was carried out in an open system
and the atmospheric conditions favoured the generation of dry
crust on its surface. The co-composting was performed under traditional process in open piles and aeration was assured by turning

process.
For this study, four composting piles, denoted as P1, P2, P3
and P4, were monitored. The composting pile dimensions were
## 160 × 1.5 × 2 m. All composting piles were aerated using a compost

turner, once every two weeks during the hydrolytic and maturity
stages. The temperature of the composting piles was continuously
recorded using a PT-100 type sensor 0.5 m below the surface of
the pile throughout the composting process. The composting was

performed for 60 days.

2.3. Sample collection

Samples from the reception area, fermentation area, composting piles and leachate lagoon were collected in different periods
depending on the type of waste. After mixing raw materials in the
reception area and before being transferred to the fermentation
area, different solid and gaseous samples were taken to be analysed
as the initial sample. Subsequently, the fermentation area was progressively filled while AL was generated in the olive oil production
process. The fermentation area was filled for 4 months, which corresponds to the olive milling time. Once the olive oil production was
finished, the fermentation area was completely filled, and the fermentation period was considered to start from that moment until
the end of the year. Samples were collected from the hydrolytic
phase of the last filling of the fermentation area. In this area, the
compostable mixture generated a dry crust on its surface, which
helps to minimize the odoriferous impact derived from the fermentative pretreatment (Section 3.2). Thus, two different samples
were taken from this area corresponding to the surface (M S ) and
the inner (M I ) regions of the compostable mixture, specifically in
the four corners and the centre of the mixture. In the case of the

composting piles, solid and gaseous samples (Section 2.7) were col
lected at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 days of co-composting and they were
denoted as S0, S15, S30, S45 and S60. Solid samples were collected
in the four corners and the centre of each pile, following a composite sample procedure. Finally, liquid and gaseous samples were
collected from the leachate lagoon.

2.4. Physico-chemical analysis

All samples were physico-chemically analysed according to the
nature of the waste (solid or liquid). Solid samples were characterized following the methodology proposed by The US Department
of Agriculture and The US Composting Council (2002). Liquid sample characterization was performed according to the standard
methods for examining water and wastewater proposed by APHA
et al. (2005). The metal content of the samples was evaluated
at the end of the co-composting process by atomic absorption
spectrophotometry (spectrophotometer model AAnalyst 100/300,
Perkin Elmer). All analyses were carried out in triplicate.
For solid samples, moisture (M, %), total solids (TS, %), fixed solids
(FS, %), volatile solids (VS, %), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (N-TKN, %),
### ammoniacal nitrogen (N-NH 4 [+], %), and phosphorus content (P 2 O 5,

%) were analysed in the solid fraction, while soluble total organic
carbon (C TOC, %), soluble inorganic carbon (C IC, %), soluble total
carbon (C TC, %), soluble total nitrogen (TN S, %), pH and conductivity (Cond,  S/cm) were analysed in the aqueous extract (1:25 v/v
ratio).
pH, conductivity (Cond,  S/cm), total solids (TS, mg/L), fixed
solids (FS, mg/L), volatile solids (VS, mg/L), total suspended solids
(TSS, mg/L), fixed suspended solids (FSS, mg/L), volatile suspended

mg/L), soluble inorganic carbon (C IC, mg/L), soluble total carbon (C TC, mg/L), soluble total nitrogen (TN S, mg/L) and soluble
chemical oxygen demand (COD S, mg/L) were analysed in liquid
samples.
It is important to highlight that C TOC, C IC, C TC and TN S were quantified with a Shimadzu carbon analyzer model TOC-V CSH with a
TNM-1 module, which is based on catalytic oxidation and detection
by infrared spectrometry.

2.5. Microbiological analysis

Microbiological analysis was performed to quantify the
microorganisms of the final compost in order to guarantee its use

as organic fertilizer in agriculture. Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli,
Coliforms and Clostridium Perfringens were determined by the Agriculture and Fisheries Management Agency of Andalusia (Regional
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and the Environment) according
to the methodology proposed by UNE-EN ISO 6579-1:2017, UNEEN ISO 16649-2:2001, UNE-EN ISO 4832:2006 and UNE-EN ISO
7937:2004, respectively.

2.6. Stability test

The stability of the composted material and leachate derived

from storing chicken manure was measured through a static-liquid
respirometry method patented by the Department of Inorganic
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of the University of Cordoba

(Spain) (Publication No. ES2283171 A1 of 16 October 2007). The

experiments were carried under standardized conditions of temperature (30 [◦] C), pH (neutral value), inhibition of nitrification (by
### adding thiourea, CH 4 N 2 S) and addition of macronutrients (fer
ric chloride, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride) to promote
the mineralization of organic matter, measured as microbiological oxygen consumption. The device works with a discontinuous
aeration system that maintains the oxygen concentration within a
previously established interval. This equipment provides the spe### cific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR, mg O 2 /g VS h), which indicates

the microbiological biodegradation rate of organic matter, and the
### cumulative oxygen demand at 20 h (OD 20, mg O 2 /g VS), which pro
vides the biodegradability of the substrate.

2.7. Olfactometric analysis

The odour samples from different emitting surfaces, such as

the fermentation area, leachate lagoon and composting piles, were
collected using a ventilated sampling hood (Supplementary material 1). This system consisted of a structure with a 1 m [2] covered
surface and two radial fans (inlet and outlet) that operate at constant volumetric flow to homogenize the air from the odoriferous
material and extract the odour sample through the opposite corner by the second radial fan. The inlet fan pulls in outside air via
an exchangeable orifice and transports the air from the top to a
corner of the hood through an active carbon filter, injecting nonodorous air inside the hood. A standard sampling device (CSD30)
was connected to the sampling hood to collect the odour samples
from the suction nozzles in 10-L Nalophan [®] sampling bags, evacuating air using a vacuum pump with a default odour sampling
duration of 30 min per VDI guideline 3880 (2011). Both sampling
devices were manufactured by Olfasense GmbH (Germany) and
are fully compliant with the European norm EN 13725 (2003) and
VDI guideline 3880 (2011). It is important to note that the sampling hood is suitable for sampling both solid and liquid odour
emission sources. Thus, floats were mounted to the sides of the
hood to sample odour emission from the leachate lagoon. Finally,
the odour samples collected from the different emission sources
were analysed by dynamic olfactometry. A TO8 olfactometer, also
developed by Olfasense GmbH based on the ‘Yes/No’ method,
was used to determine the odour concentration (OC, ou E /m [3] ) in
each sample. OC was assessed with a panel of four assessors previously calibrated with n-butanol (60 ppm). OC was calculated

by the geometric mean of the odour threshold values of each
assessor and multiplied by a factor that depends on the olfactometer dilution step factor. The olfactometry analyses were carried
out in the olfactometry laboratory at ambient conditions (20 [◦] C
and 1 atm). All gaseous samples were collected in duplicate and

were analysed within 30 h after sampling, according to EN 13725
(2003).

### 3. Results and discussion

#### 3.1. Physico-chemical characteristics assessment of the

composting plant

3.1.1. Evaluation of the fermentation area
The fermentation area is designed to cover the needs of valorising the waste generated in the areas adjacent to the composting
plant with the aim to hydrolyse the organic matter and reduce the
moisture content of the compostable mixture. During the anaerobic fermentation pretreatment, two different layers are formed:
an internal and fresh layer (M I ), where the mixture is subjected
to anaerobic pretreatment, and an external layer with a dry crust
(M S ), which is formed by environmental conditions such as ambient
temperature (in the range of 10-40 [◦] C) and relative humidity of the
plant location (without high rainfall). The physico-chemical characterization of the initial mixture and both layers in the fermentation
area is shown in Table 1. As can be seen, an acidic pH of 5.81 is
observed in M I due to the fermentative stage of the compostable
mixture, which generates a high concentration of organic acids by
accelerated microbial activity under anoxic conditions (Ravi et al.,
2018). Throughout the fermentative time, there is a loss of organic
acids by leaching, generating a progressive increase in pH, which is
observed at the beginning of the co-composting process (Fig. 1A).
Conversely, M S shows an alkaline pH of 9.29 since the surface is in
direct contact with ambient air, oxidizing the surface material and
reducing its moisture content.
Regarding the organic matter, VS reveal significant differences
between both layers. The initial mixture contains a high amount
of organic matter (83 %), which needs time to be hydrolysed and
transformed by anaerobic microorganisms (hydrolytic-acidogenic
step). Moreover, the addition of OL and CS to the mixture provides a high content of the lignocellulosic fraction with less labile
organic matter, which has a slow biodegradation rate and requires
other treatments, such as composting, to be degraded (Toledo et al.,
2019b; Varma et al., 2017), although they are required to provide structure and compensate nutrients. During the fermentative
pretreatment, M I showed a reduction of VS with regard to the
initial mixture from 83 % to 76 %, which explains the hydrolysis
of organic matter and its degradation by anaerobic microorgan
isms. For M S, organic matter oxidation and moisture loss had a

time.

high influence on VS reduction (Toledo et al., 2019a). The atmospheric air helped in carrying out a bio-oxidative process, which
means that oxidation of organic matter occurs by aerobic microorganisms in the surface layer. Similar behaviour is observed for
soluble organic matter (C TOC ), which is an important variable in
fermentative degradation. M I shows a higher amount of C TOC due
to the hydrolysis of organic matter. In this sense, the soluble organic
matter is used by a different set of microorganisms i.e., hydrolytics, acidogens, methanogens, etc., to produce carbohydrates, amino
acids, fat, methane and carbon dioxide (Kainthola et al., 2019). This
soluble fraction could also be lost throughout the fermentative process by leaching, being enriched with soluble organic matter and
reused for wetting process of the composting piles, which avoids
wastewater treatment and minimizes irrigation costs.
In terms of nitrogen content, CM provides a large proportion of
the nitrogen (approximately 80 %) present as uric acid and urea,
## generating high amounts of free ammonia (NH 3 ) and ammonium

ions (NH 4 [+] ) during anaerobic decomposition (Wang et al., 2014).
In this sense, both layers show slight differences in N-TKN and NNH 4 [+] content. For M I, anaerobic bacteria associated with manure
## can decompose the uric acid into NH 3 and CO 2 . However, the NH 3

formed could be neutralized by the higher levels of organic acids
## produced, thereby reducing the volatilization of NH 3 and the emis
sion of unpleasant odours (Mahimairaja et al., 1994). It is noted
that nitrogen plays an important role in the protein synthesis of
microorganisms and the compostable material should have an optimum C/N ratio to carry out a correct composting process. Previous
studies highlighted that the theoretically optimal C/N interval is
25-40 at the beginning of the composting process (Gil et al., 2018;
Maulini-Duran et al., 2014) and the value determined in the compostable material was 36.91. Thus, the material provides an optimal
C/N ratio to start the aerobic microbiological process.

Evaluation of the composting process
Among all monitored variables during

3.1.2.

Among all monitored variables during the composting process,

only pH and temperature have a direct influence on the dynamics of the microbial process affecting the correct developing of the
process and the quality of the final product.
Temperature is a good indicator of microbial activity, which fluctuates with the degradation of organic matter contained in CM and
AL and other more difficult biodegradable materials such as cellulose, lignin or even polymers related to CS and OL. Temperature
is widely recognized to be one of the most important variables in
composting control. Increasing the temperature of the compostable
material is highly related to the microbial activity (Toledo et al.,

366 M. Toledo et al. / Process Safety and Environmental Protection 139 (2020) 362-370

2018). In fact, small temperature variations during the composting
process affect the microbiological activity more than small changes
in humidity, pH or C/N (Liang et al., 2003; Miyatake and Iwabuchi,
2006). Previous studies highlighted that thermophilic temperature
(>55 [◦] C) is required for at least three consecutive days to ensure
the sanitization of the composting mixture, destroying the potential pathogens and vigorously degrading the organic matter by
populations of thermophilic bacteria (Robledo-Mahón et al., 2019;
Zhang and He, 2006). In this study, the temperature evolution of all
composting piles, including the ambient temperature, is shown in
Fig. 1B. Two stages with thermophilic temperature were detected at
5 and 22 days of composting, reaching 55 and 58 [◦] C, respectively.
During the first 5 days of composting, the high microbial activity generated a progressive increase in temperature until reaching
the first thermophilic range. Subsequently, turning the composting piles (every 15 days) favoured activating of the microbiota
responsible for biodegrading organic matter and increasing the
temperature in a second thermophilic stage at 22 days of composting. The compostable mixture maintained a temperature exceeding
55 [◦] C for 3 consecutive days in both thermophilic stages and therefore, the material was sanitized. After 30 days of composting, the
organic matter became more stabilized and the microbial activity

slowed down, which resulted in a gradual decrease in temperature
to an ambient temperature of 30 [◦] C. It should be noted that the
ambient temperature did not significantly affect the synergy of the
temperature in composting piles.
Changes in pH generate the formation of nuisance odours and
provide relevant information about the stability of the compostable
material (Toledo et al., 2019a). pH evolution of the compostable
material throughout the composting time is shown in Fig. 1A. The
previous fermentative pretreatment of the material increased the
pH value starting at 9.25, due mainly to the high hydrolysis of the
nitrogen contained in the mixture. At 15 days of composting, the
initial pH underwent a slight decrease because the microorganisms act on the most labile organic matter, producing a release of
organic acids and obtaining intermediate compounds that provide
C TOC . During this time, turning process improved the aeration conditions of the composting piles, which implies increased microbial
activity, known as the hydrolytic stage, also generating unpleasant
odours (Toledo et al., 2018; Turan et al., 2007). After 15 days, a progressive pH stabilization was observed, which might be due to the
loss of organic acids by leaching and transformation with the generation of NH 3 from protein decomposition (Sánchez-Monedero et al.,
2001). Subsequently, the composting piles were turned, increasing
the aeration to favour degrading less labile organic matter, which
reduced pH values between days 30 and 45 of the composting process while temperature decreased. Finally, there was a progressive
increase of pH until reaching 60 days of composting, indicating an
adequate biodegradative process.
Conductivity depends largely on the salinity present in the starting materials. This salinity can cause toxicity in plants and its
value in the final product should not exceed 2000  S/cm (WRAP,
2014). According to Fig. 1A, all composting piles showed a range of
1300-1600  S/cm at the beginning of the process. In all cases, there
was a slight decrease, reaching a range of 1400-1200  S/cm at the
end of the composting process, mainly due to the loss of salinity by
leaching.
Knowledge of the organic matter content of compost is essential, as it is considered the main factor in determining its agronomic
quality (Zhang et al., 2012). Fig. 2 shows the evolution of VS during
the composting time, with two stages of VS reduction well differentiated. Throughout the first 30 days of the process, VS was
slightly reduced due to the degradation of organic matter, from
73-69 % to 68-63 %, in all composting piles. The previous pretreatment degraded a fraction by anaerobic microorganisms from 83

% to 73 %, taking into account the characterization of the initial

mixture and considering that the dry crust constitutes 10 % (w/w)
of the material. As can be seen, the degradation was less inten
sive during the fermentative process due to the transformation

into more biodegradable organic matter, which was the aim of this

stage. Thus, the transformation rate of organic matter during the

last hydrolytic stage (3 months) was 0.11 %/day. From 30-45 days,

there was a rapid cooling of the composting piles caused by sanitizing the mixture and the mesophilic microbiota suffered a lag phase,

causing VS stability during this time. Likewise, the metabolism
of the remaining microorganisms was activated, increasing their
concentration to degrade the organic matter under these conditions. After 45 days of composting, a second VS reduction was
observed, from 68-63 % to 60-54 %, where other more resistant
materials, such as lignin, were slowly degraded and transformed
into humic compounds related to the humification of compost and
the maturity stage (Castaldi et al., 2005). During this time, the
composting piles were subjected to turning and wetting processes,
which reactivated the degradation of organic matter and therefore
reducing the content in VS. At the end of co-composting, the degradation rate of organic matter from the initial stage was 0.28 %/day,
which explains that VS were transformed during the hydrolytic
stage and there was a higher reduction of VS during co-composting
time.

Nitrogen is another essential nutrient for obtaining a quality
organic fertilizer for plant growth (Nakasaki et al., 2019). The mineralization of organic nitrogen and organic matter could be highly
related during composting. Fig. 3A shows the relationship between
TNs and TOC for all composting piles throughout the process to
jointly evaluate the behaviour of both soluble biodegradable fractions of organic matter and nitrogen. As can be seen, there is a linear
trend between both variables (r [2] = 0.7592) regardless of the composting time. In this sense, mineralization of organic matter and
nitrogen occurred and slight reduction in the concentration of both
soluble fractions were observed; however, the transformation of
soluble nitrogen was lower than the variation observed for soluble organic matter. Moreover, it is important in obtaining a quality
product to favour the conservation of nitrogen as a nutrient in compost. The evolution of N-NH 4 [+] /NT S ratio with composting time is
shown in Fig. 3B. Small losses of nitrogen occurred during composting due to ammoniacal nitrogen, in the form of NH 3 and N 2 O,
by nitrogen volatilization in relation to the pH values shown in
Fig. 1A, enhancing the generation of unpleasant odours (Jiang et al.,
2016).
In terms of compost quality, Table 2 shows the physico-chemical
characteristics and microbiological analysis of the final compost

and the limit values established by the Royal Decree 506/2013.

As can be seen, the final product was found to be a nutrient-rich
organic amendment suitable for agricultural soils.
Finally, an important factor in the quality of the final product,
from an agricultural point of view, is its heavy metal content, which
can be accumulated in soil and transferred to elevated levels in the

food chain. The hazard level of heavy metals in compost is linked
to their toxicity and persistence (Mohee and Soobhany, 2014). Currently, Royal Decree 506/2013 establishes three maximum limits
of metals content to classify the compost into three classes (A, B,
C) according to these limits (Supplementary material 2). The metal
content of the composted mixture at the end of the composting
process is shown in Table 2. With respect to the values obtained,
the material had an excellent metal content for use as fertilizer in

agriculture (Compost type A), except for copper concentration (Cu)
with 88 mg/kg (Supplementary material 1). It is important to highlight that olive fields are treated with copper-based fungicides, such
as copper sulphate, which is the main infection control method
throughout olive-growing regions of the world (Obanor et al., 2008;
Ramos et al., 2012). This fact explains the slight accumulation of this
metal. Cu and Zn were found to be the heavy metals with the highest
concentrations and are the most common metals in CM (Ravindran
et al., 2017).

Evaluation of the leachate lagoon
During the fermentation of the

3.1.3.

During the fermentation of the compostable mixture and its sub
sequent bio-oxidative process, the leachate lagoon collects large
amounts of organic material with high concentrations of mineral
salts, nutrients and microorganisms derived from the moisture
content of the mixture. This leachate is reused for wetting process the composting piles, with the consequent minimization of
irrigation costs and avoiding post-treatment of this liquid organic
material. Thus, it is important to know the composition of the
leachate as well as its organic load or metal content to evaluate
its influence on the composting piles during wetting process. The
composition of leachate is characterized by high amounts of organic

matter (mainly biodegradable, but also resistant to biodegradation), organic and inorganic salts, nitrogen, heavy metals and other
diluted chemicals (Kulikowska and Klimiuk, 2008). In this context,
the physico-chemical characterization and metal content of the
#### leachate lagoon is shown in Table 3. As can be observed, a pH of

7.60 reveals the low concentration of organic acids, mainly volatile

and biodegradable compounds through aerobic degradation, which
is related to the high pH values of the mixture throughout its
treatment. According to Huang et al. (2004), during the composting process, the conductivity of the compostable material could
decrease due to the loss of mineral salts by leaching. This fact
explains the accumulation of mineral salts from the fermentative and composting areas in the leachate lagoon with an average
conductivity value of 5470  S/cm. Moreover, the organic matter content in the form of soluble total organic carbon (C TOC ) and
the nitrogen content (N-TKN and N-NH 4 [+] ) could favour microbial
activity during the composting process, increasing the essential
nutrients to obtain a high-quality compost. Moreover, its stability and odour concentration were also quantified in Section 3.3
### and Table 3. It was found to be a stable and non-odorous organic

material useful for wetting the composting piles.
On the other hand, it is important to evaluate the influence of
leachate on the compostable mixture in terms of heavy metal addition during wetting processes. As can be seen in Table 3, the metal
content of the leachate lagoon shows a high concentration of Copper (Cu) and Zinc (Zn), with 2.25 mg/L and 2.32 mg/L, respectively,
which are dragged by leaching during the anaerobic and aerobic
treatment of the compostable mixture. Thus, the wetting process
could slightly increase the concentration of both heavy metals in
the final product. The most prevalent metals in the composted
material are listed in Table 2. However, wetting the composting
piles with leachate did not cause a significant increase in the concentration of heavy metals.

The odoriferous impact derived from the different emission
sources of the composting plant, from the fermentation area to

the composting area, was evaluated. Previous studies highlighted

the high OC of manure of different animal species derived from
farms, including 25,000 ou E /m [3] for poultry manure during storage
(Keck et al., 2018). In this study, the internal layer (M I ) of the compostable mixture in the fermentative area showed 1579 ou E /m [3] and
the external layer (M S ) was 30 ou E /m [3] (Table 1), and therefore, the
dry crust minimized the odour emissions generated by the stored
mixture. The dry crust was formed about three months from the
beginning of the fermentative stage due to the atmospheric conditions, which can be translated into an average odour emission rate
of 4.73 ou E /kg during this time and considering the total mass of
compostable mixture to be treated. Once the dry crust is formed,
the average emission rate in this area decreased considerably with
a value of 0.09 ou E /kg during the remaining months of fermentation
treatment. Moreover, the addition of CS and OL to the mixture led
to a reduction in OC compared to that of manure alone, as proven
by Keck et al. (2018).
In the case of the composting area, the OC was found to be in an
initial range of 430-630 ou E /m [3] at the beginning of the composting
process (Fig. 4) and similar trends were observed for all piles. At 15
days of composting time, the OC was rapidly decreasing in line with
the completion of the hydrolytic stage, reaching 180-220 ou E /m [3] .
Subsequently, the OC decreased progressively to 30 ou E /m [3] as the
temperature of the piles approached ambient temperature and the
microbiological activity declined, thus achieving a stable final product in terms of odorous impact. Considering the treatment time and
the total mass to be treated, the average emission rate in this area
was 0.34 ou E /kg. It is important to highlight that previous studies
reported that the behaviour of odour concentration is related to
the temperature profiles during composting time (González et al.,
2020; Toledo et al., 2019b). In this study, the highest odour concentrations were quantified at the beginning of the composting process
where the first thermophilic stage is detected (Fig. 1B). However,
the second thermophilic stage did not cause an increase in the
emission of odour, which is related to the pretreatment applied
in the fermentative area. Similar results were obtained by Toledo
et al. (2018) who demonstrated that composting of sewage sludge
pretreated through anaerobic digestion reduced odorous impact
during the composting process, without affecting the quality of the
final product negatively.
On an overall basis and taking into account the average odour
emission rates of both treatments, the global odour emission rate

of the composting plant was 5.16 ou E /kg.

M. Toledo et al. / Process Safety and Environmental Protection 139 (2020) 362-370 369

Finally, the leachate lagoon showed a low OC (128 ou E /m [3] )
according to Table 3, as this liquid waste contains a high amount

of water and highly mineralised and easily biodegradable organic
matter. Similar results were obtained by Toledo et al. (2019a),
where the leachate lagoon collected landfill leachate, flushing
water and leachate composting from a waste management plant
(WMP).

3.3. Stability of the different odour emission sources

### Supplementary material 3 shows the SOUR results (mg

O 2 /gVS h) obtained for each area of the composting plant (fermentative area, composting area and leachate lagoon). Specifically,
there were differences between the oxygen consumed by the internal (SOUR I ) and external (SOUR S ) compostable mixture in the
fermentative area throughout the respirometric test. As can be
observed, the maximum SOUR readings in both layers were completely different, with 45 mg O 2 /g VS h for M I and 0.9 mg O 2 /g VS h
for M S . This fact reveals the high stability of M S due to the oxidation of the organic matter influenced by the atmospheric air, which
is seen in the reduction of VS (Table 1). In the case of M I, there
is a high content of organic matter that needs to be mineralised
during the fermentative pretreatment, thus requiring a subsequent
bio-oxidative treatment to achieve a stable and sanitized material.

In this regard and according to the European Commission
(2014), maximum respirometric index of 25 mmol O 2 /kg VS h is the
minimum quality requirement for compost to be considered stable.
The final maximum SOUR reached at the end of the composting
process was 0.46 mg O 2 /g VS h or 14 mmol O 2 /kg VS h; therefore,
the final product was correctly stabilized. It is important to note
that leachate showed a very low SOUR value of 0.32 mg O 2 /g VS h
(Supplementary material 3), thus, adequate for use in wetting the
composting piles.

**4.** **Conclusions**

The physico-chemical, respirometric and olfactometric monitoring of the composting plant allowed the evaluation of an
adequate treatment to jointly valorise waste with a high generation volume in the areas adjacent to the plant, such as CM, AL, OL
and CS, and the following conclusions can be drawn:

- The mixture of CM, AL, OL and CS to carry out the co-composting
process was found to be an adequate alternative to obtain a
quality final product with the consequent environmental and economic benefit. Moreover, the average global odour emission rate
derived from the treatments of the composting plant was 5.16
ou E /kg.
- The anaerobic fermentation pretreatment of the compostable
mixture helped to (1) hydrolyse the non-easily biodegradable
organic matter, (2) reduce its moisture content and (3) minimise
the odorous impact by the dry crust formed in the surface layer
(M S ).
- The temperature of composting piles reached a thermophilic
range of 58 [◦] C for more than three consecutive days, guaranteeing the sanitization of the composted mixture. Moreover, a 32 %
reduction in VS was achieved from the initial mixture to the end

of composting time and nitrogen was successfully retained in the
mixture with small losses.

- Finally, the final compost showed high stability and quality
according to the low SOUR value of 0.46 mg O 2 /g VS h, more than
35 % of VS, a content in metals and microorganisms below the
limit established for Compost type A, thus obtaining a quality

product to be used as fertilizer in agriculture.
