**APPLICABLE CODES AND STANDARDS:**

AS1359, CSA C22.2 No100-04, UL142, UL489, UL869, UL2200, NFPA37, NFPA70,
NFPA99, NFPA110, IBC, IEC60034-1, ISO3046, ISO8528, NEMA MG1-22, NEMA
MG1-33, 2006/95/EC, 2006/42/EC, 2004/108/EC.
Note: Codes may not be available in all model configurations. Please consult your
local Cat Dealer representative for availability.

**STANDBY:** Output available with varying load for the duration of the interruption
of the normal source power. Average power output is 70% of the standby power
rating. Typical operation is 200 hours per year, with maximum expected usage of
500 hours per year.

**PRIME:** Output available with varying load for an unlimited time. Average power
output is 70% of the prime power rating. Typical peak demand is 100% of prime
rated ekW with 10% overload capability for emergency use for a maximum of 1
hour in 12. Overload operation cannot exceed 25 hours per year

RATINGS: Ratings are based on SAE J1349 standard conditions. These ratings
also apply at ISO3046 standard conditions.

**DEFINITIONS AND CONDITIONS**

1 For ambient and altitude capabilities consult your Cat dealer. Air flow restriction

(system) is added to existing restriction from factory.

2 Emissions data measurement procedures are consistent with those described

in EPA CFR 40 Part 89, Subpart D & E and ISO8178-1 for measuring HC, CO, PM,
NOx. Data shown is based on steady state operating conditions of 77° F, 28.42
in HG and number 2 diesel fuel with 35° API and LHV of 18,390 BTU/lb. The
nominal emissions data shown is subject to instrumentation, measurement,
facility and engine to engine variations. Emissions data is based on 100% load
and thus cannot be used to compare to EPA regulations which use values based
on a weighted cycle.

3 UL 2200 Listed packages may have oversized generators with a different

temperature rise and motor starting characteristics. Generator temperature rise
is based on a 40° C ambient per NEMA MG1-32.
