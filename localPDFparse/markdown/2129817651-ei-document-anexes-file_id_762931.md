## First aid measures

**Eye contact**

**Skin contact**

**Inhalation**

**Ingestion**

**:**

**:**

**:**

**:**

Get medical attention immediately. Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at
least 15 minutes, occasionally lifting the upper and lower eyelids.

In case of contact, immediately flush skin with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes
while removing contaminated clothing and shoes. Wash clothing before reuse. Clean
shoes thoroughly before reuse. Get medical attention immediately.

Move exposed person to fresh air. If not breathing, if breathing is irregular or if
respiratory arrest occurs, provide artificial respiration or oxygen by trained personnel.
Loosen tight clothing such as a collar, tie, belt or waistband. Get medical attention
immediately.

Wash out mouth with water. Do not induce vomiting unless directed to do so by medical
personnel. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Get medical
attention immediately.

**Protection of first-aiders** **:** No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without suitable training. If it is
suspected that fumes are still present, the rescuer should wear an appropriate mask or
self-contained breathing apparatus. It may be dangerous to the person providing aid to
give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Wear suitable protective clothing and gloves.
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes.

## Accidental release measures

**Personal precautions** **:**

No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without suitable training.
Evacuate surrounding areas. Keep unnecessary and unprotected personnel from
entering. Do not touch or walk through spilled material. Avoid breathing vapor or mist.
Provide adequate ventilation. Wear appropriate respirator when ventilation is
inadequate. Put on appropriate personal protective equipment (see section 8).

**Environmental precautions**

**Methods for cleaning up**

**:** Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains
and sewers.

**Small spill** **:** Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Absorb with an inert material.
Dispose of via a licensed waste disposal contractor.

**Large spill** **:**

Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Approach release from
upwind. Dike spill area and do not allow product to reach sewage system or surface or
ground water. Notify any reportable spill to authorities. (See section 12 for environmental
risks and 13 for disposal information.) Contain and collect spillage with noncombustible, absorbent material e.g. sand, earth, vermiculite or diatomaceous earth and
place in container for disposal according to local regulations (see section 13). Dispose
of via a licensed waste disposal contractor. Contaminated absorbent material may pose
the same hazard as the spilled product. Note: see section 1 for emergency contact
information and section 13 for waste disposal.

**If RQ (Reportable Quantity) is exceeded, report to National Spill Response Office at 1-800-424-8802.**

## Handling and storage

**Handling**

**Storage**

**:**

**:**

Put on appropriate personal protective equipment (see section 8). Eating, drinking and
smoking should be prohibited in areas where this material is handled, stored and
processed. Workers should wash hands and face before eating, drinking and smoking.
Persons with a history of skin sensitization problems should not be employed in any
process in which this product is used. Do not get in eyes or on skin or clothing. Do not
ingest. Avoid breathing vapor or mist. Use only with adequate ventilation. Empty
containers retain product residue and can be hazardous. Do not reuse container.

Store in accordance with local regulations. Store in a dry, cool and well-ventilated area,
away from incompatible materials (see section 10). Keep container tightly closed and
sealed until ready for use. Containers that have been opened must be carefully resealed
and kept upright to prevent leakage. Do not store in unlabeled containers. Use
appropriate containment to avoid environmental contamination.

**Form:** [a]Vapour and aerosols

**Consult local authorities for acceptable exposure limits.**

**Only components of this product with established exposure limits appear in the box above.**

**If OSHA permissible exposure levels are shown above they are the OSHA 1989 levels or are from subsequent**
**OSHA regulatory actions. Although the 1989 levels have been vacated the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, Baker**
**Hughes recommends that these lower exposure levels be observed as reasonable worker protection.**

**Recommended monitoring**
**procedures**

**:** If this product contains ingredients with exposure limits, personal, workplace atmosphere
or biological monitoring may be required to determine the effectiveness of the ventilation
or other control measures and/or the necessity to use respiratory protective equipment.

**1/30/2010.** SX9240 _**3/7**_

**Engineering measures** **:** Use only with adequate ventilation. If user operations generate dust, fumes, gas, vapor
or mist, use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation or other engineering controls
to keep worker exposure to airborne contaminants below any recommended or statutory
limits.

**Hygiene measures** **:** Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before
eating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period. Ensure that
eyewash stations and safety showers are close to the workstation location. Take off
contaminated clothing and wash before re-use.

**Personal protection**

**Respiratory**

**:**

Use a properly fitted, air-purifying or air-fed respirator complying with an approved
standard if a risk assessment indicates this is necessary. Respirator selection must be
based on known or anticipated exposure levels, the hazards of the product and the safe
working limits of the selected respirator.

**Hands** **:** Chemical-resistant gloves.

**Eyes**

**Skin**
