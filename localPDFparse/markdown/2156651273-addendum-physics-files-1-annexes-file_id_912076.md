## Abstract An ambient air quality study was under
taken in two cities (Pamplona and Alsasua) of the
Province of Navarre in northern Spain from July 2001
to June 2004. The data were obtained from two urban

monitoring sites. At both monitoring sites, ambient
levels of ozone, NO x, and SO 2 were measured.
Simultaneously with levels of PM 10 measured at
Alsasua (using a laser particle counter), PM 10 levels
were also determined at Pamplona (using a beta
attenuation monitor). Mean annual PM 10 concentrations in Pamplona and Alsasua reached 30 and 28 μg
m [−][3], respectively. These concentrations are typical for
urban background sites in Northern Spain. By using
meteorological information and back trajectories, it
was found that the number of exceedances of the

daily PM 10 limit as well as the PM 10 temporal
variation was highly influenced by air masses from
North Africa. Although North African transport was

highest observed PM 10 levels. Transport from the
Atlantic Ocean was observed on 68% of the days;
transport from Europe on 13%; low transport and
local influences on 7%; and transport from the
Mediterranean region on 3% of the days. The mean
O 3 concentrations were 45 and 55 μg m [−][3] in
Pamplona and Alsasua, respectively, which were
above the values reported for the main Spanish cities.
The mean NO and NO 2 levels were very similar in
both sites (12 and 26 μg m [−][3], respectively). Mean
SO 2 levels were 8 μg m [−][3] in Pamplona and 5 μg m [−][3]

in Alsasua. Hourly levels of PM 10, NO and NO 2
showed similar variations with the typically two
coincident maximums during traffic rush hours
demonstrating a major anthropogenic origin of
PM 10, in spite of the sporadic dust outbreaks.

### Introduction

There is an increasing interest in the study of
atmospheric pollutants mainly due to their adverse
effects on health (Dockery et al. 1993) and ecosystems (Davison and Barnes 1998). At the local level,
atmospheric pollution is an essentially urban problem
because of three main factors: 1) most of the
anthropogenic emission sources are inside or near

138 Environ Monit Assess (2007) 134:137-151

the cities (e.g., traffic and factories); 2) urban “heat
island” effect of the cities; and 3) many people live in
the cities: 73% in the developed countries and 36% in
the developing countries, with the percentages
expected to continue rising especially in the developing countries (Population Reference Bureau 1998).
Population increase in the cities leads to an
increase in pollutant levels there and in nearby areas
as a result of increase in the emission sources, chiefly
traffic. For this reason, ambient air quality sampling
sites are concentrated in cities so as to provide measurements of the concentrations of NO, NO x, SO 2, O 3, CO
and PM 10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm), also called the traditional MAPs
(Major Air Pollutants) (Wiederkehr and Yoon 1998) or
“classic” pollutants, as well as measurement of
meteorological parameters. Directives and regulations
that aim at controlling atmospheric levels of the more
important atmospheric pollutants have been approved
by different state agencies (US EPA 1997; EU 1999).
These directives and regulations require that “high”
levels of pollutants to be reduced (i.e., not to exceed
maximum allowable concentrations), thereby mitigating the injurious effects of these pollutants. Thus, it is
important to undertake studies that are aimed at more
accurate determination of the levels, variations and
sources of the main atmospheric pollutants, and to
draw conclusions that allow greater control of such
pollutants. In this sense the present study focuses on
the interpretations of the annual, weekly, and daily
variations of “classic” pollutants in urban and industrial sites of northern Spain, with specific climatic and
geographical patterns compared with other regions of

Fig. 1 Location of the air
quality sampling sites

Spain. As far as we know this is the first study
published on this topic in the study region.
PM 10 studies are particularly important for Mediterranean regions since these areas experience frequent transport of air masses from North Africa that
lead to a considerable increase in the levels of

atmospheric particulate matter (Escudero et al. 2005;
Querol et al. 1998; Rodríguez et al. 2001). This issue
has been taken into account by the European
Directive 1999/30/CE in which member countries

must report exceedances resulting from this transport
in order not to be held accountable for those specific
exceedances.

### Materials and methods

The study focused on two cities, Pamplona and
Alsasua, of the Province of Navarre in Northern
Spain from July 2001 until June 2004 (Fig. 1).
Pamplona (42.49°N, 1.38°W) is the capital of this
Province and is centrally located on a plateau, 450 m
above sea level. The city covers an area of 23.55 km [2]

with a population of about 200,000 people and a
vehicle fleet of one vehicle for each two inhabitants

(100,000). Pamplona’s climate is sub-Mediterranean,
transitioning between oceanic temperate and continental Mediterranean due to its geographical location. The
average annual precipitation is about 830 mm that is
typically distributed over 135 days/year. The predom[inant winds are from NW http://www.pamplona.net).](http://www.pamplona.net)
Aguinaga et al. (1999) grouped the sources of
atmospheric pollutants in Pamplona into three major

Environ Monit Assess (2007) 134:137-151 139

categories: Inter-urban traffic, intra-urban traffic and
fixed sources, including residential heating and factories located in numerous industrial estates within the

periphery of the city.
The city of Alsasua (42.54°N, 2.10°W) is located
in the northwestern zone of Navarre, 534 m above sea
level, and occupies a land area of 26.8 km [2] . It has a
population of about 7,200 inhabitants making it the
most populous city in the region with a vehicle fleet
of about 3,900 vehicles. Alsasua’s climate is subAtlantic, characterized by an abundance of precipitation, relatively severe winters, and a short summer dry
period in August transitioning between oceanic
temperate and continental Mediterranean due to its
geographical location. The annual average precipitation is about 1,385 mm with rains randomly distributed over 140 days. The predominant winds are from
[NW (http://www.alsasua.net). The city of Alsasua is](http://www.alsasua.net)
located in an important communication corridor
between Navarre and the Basque Country (located to
the Northwest of Navarra), as well as in a railway
corridor covering the Irun-Madrid and Irun-Barcelona routes. The presence of these roadways and
railroads has favored industrial development of the
region, which in turn has attracted diverse industries
such as a metallurgical factory located 3 km in the
direction of SE and one cement factory located 2 km
in the direction of SW of the sampling site.
The two sampling sites used in this study are both
representing the urban background of the two cities.
In Pamplona, PM 10 was measured using a beta
attenuation monitor (Dasibi Model 70011, Dasibi
Environmental Corporation, Glendale, CA, USA). In
addition, O 3, NO x, and SO 2 levels were measured
using Dasibi monitors (Models 1008, 2108, and 4108,
respectively). The operating principles for each of
these instruments are summarized in Table 1. Similar

measurements were carried out at Alsasua with

exception of particulate matter. At Alsasua simulta

neous measurements of PM 10, PM 2.5 and PM 1 were
made using a laser particle counter (GRIMM, Model
1.107, GRIMM Technologies, Inc., Ainring, Germany). The data were collected on a 15 min basis.
The percentage of data capture for both sampling sites
is presented in Table 2. The low data capture for NO
in Alsasua was due to sampling equipment failure
from June to September of 2003 and from January to
May of 2004. The same problem occurred for NO
measurements in Pamplona during January 2003.
Similarly, no measurements of NO 2 were made in
June 2003 because of equipment failure. At both sites,
basic meteorological parameters, including precipitation levels, wind speed and direction, relative humidity, ambient temperature, barometric pressure, and
solar insolation, were also determined. The PM 10
concentrations determined by the beta attenuation
monitor (Pamplona) and the laser particle counter
(Alsasua) were gravimetrically corrected using a
standard PM 10 high volume sampler (MCV SA,
Collbato, Barcelona, Spain).
In order to interpret the time variations of PM 10
levels and the origin of the exceedances of the PM 10
daily limit value, the origin of air masses reaching the
study area were investigated by means of meteorological charts and back trajectories. The HYSPLIT
model (Draxler and Rolph 2003) was used to calculate
daily isentropic back-trajectories ending at 12:00 UTC
for 5 days at 750, 1,500, and 2,500 m above sea level,
with 6-h time steps. Also, in order to detect possible
Sahara dust episodes, the following tools were used:

a.) The TOMS-NASA aerosol index maps (TOMS,

### Results and discussion

#### PM 10

The mean PM 10 concentrations measured during the
study period (3 years) were 29.8 and 27.7 μg m [−][3] in
Pamplona and Alsasua, respectively. As reported

(a), and Alsasua (b). Arrows

African dust outbreaks

(NAF)

previously, the PM 10 concentrations were corrected
using a correction factor obtained from one year’s
simultaneous gravimetric measurements (November
2002-October 2003). Analysis of the mean PM 10
concentrations of the different years for both sites
showed that the concentrations registered in Alsasua
diminished abruptly in 2002, but stayed approximately constant in the following years. It has to be
pointed out that summer 2002 was a very rainy summer
and PM 10 levels were relatively low across Spain. On
the contrary, the concentrations in Pamplona were
similar throughout the study period. The above annual
mean PM 10 levels would meet the 2005 requirements
of EU Directive 1999/30/CE (40 μg m [−][3] ).
The number of exceedances (n) of the limit
established by EU Directive 1999/30/CE for daily
#### PM 10 limit value for 2005 (50 μg m [−][3] ) in Pamplona

and Alsasua were 9 and 54, respectively for year 2001

Environ Monit Assess (2007) 134:137-151 141

(6 months of data); 22 and 31 for year 2002
(12 months of data); 27 and 22 for year 2003
(12 months of data); and 11 and 12 for the year
2004 (6 months of data) (Table 3).
With the exception of Alsasua during the second
half of 2001, all of the above values meet the
requirements of 1999/30/CE concerning the number
of exceedances of the daily limit value (50 μg PM 10
m [−][3] ) not to be exceeded more than 35 days/year from
2005. In the second half of 2001, 54 exceedances
were registered in Alsasua probably as a result of
prevailing thermal atmospheric inversion conditions
in the area and also possibly due to emissions from a
local cement factory. Artiñano et al. (2001), Querol et
al. (1998, 2001, 2004), Rodríguez et al. (2001) have
suggested that these limits could be exceeded in many
regions of Spain and EU, since these studies
demonstrated that the daily limit value is much more
restrictive than the annual one. Furthermore, the
influence of air masses coming from North Africa

may also contribute to increases in the annual number
of exceedances across the southern EU. As deduced

from the air back trajectory analysis, the modeling
and the satellite tools previously described, the
exceedances of the daily limit observed during this
study were closely related to dust episodes (31-40%
of these exceedances took place simultaneously
during these episodes). Viana et al. (2003) also
reported that 22-30% of exceedances for urban
background sites of the Basque Country (located next
to Navarre) during the period 1996-2000 occurred
during African dust outbreaks.
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate an example of the
influence of dust transport from North Africa during
June 2003. High PM 10 concentrations were observed
on days when transport from North Africa (labeled as
NAF) was evident.
As shown in Fig. 4, the seasonal variations in
Pamplona and Alsasua were similar, with maximum
values observed at the end of winter/start of spring and

during the summer. The high PM 10 concentrationsobserved in February March were mainly attributable
to the North African dust outbreaks, with some daily
mean PM 10 concentrations exceeding 100 μg m [−][3] . An
exception to this observation was found in the winter
of 2001 where atmospheric stability conditions may
have led to elevated PM 10 levels. The maximum levels
observed in summer were probably the result of
several causes: 1) High rate of gas-particle photochemical conversion induced by a high insolation and
high oxidizing gas levels; 2) low precipitation levels,

which increased the degree of resuspension of particles, and reduced the potential of wash-out of
particles; and 3) Higher frequency of input of PMloaded air masses from North African dust outbreaks.

#### PM concentrations and long range transport

Backward air parcel trajectories were calculated for each
day of the study and the source origins of air masses
obtained are provided in Fig. 5. Five main transport
patterns were considered for both sites: Atlantic (AT),

Environ Monit Assess (2007) 134:137-151 143

Fig. 6 Average monthly
frequency (number of days)
of the different transport
patterns for both sites

North African (NAF), Mediterranean (ME), European
(EU) and local recirculation (RE, situation caused by
lack of advective atmospheric conditions when backtrajectories originated in the Iberian Peninsula). The
predominant transport pattern was transport of air
masses from the different sectors of the Atlantic

Ocean (North, Northwest, Southwest, and West)
involving 68% of the days. The remaining source
areas are European, African, Mediterranean and local
transport patterns with the former being the most
frequent (13% of the days). The frequencies of
African and local patterns are approximately equal

-
(9 7%), while Mediterranean transport accounts for
only 3% of the days.
The seasonal distribution of the long range transport
patterns (Fig. 6) is governed by Atlantic transport. The
monthly frequencies for Atlantic transport are approximately constant throughout the year with the exception of February and March when a slight reduction in
the Atlantic transport is observed with a corresponding
increase in North African transport (Fig. 6).
The effect of European transport on Alsasua air
quality is complex to identify and quantify since this
transport is closely linked with the local pollutant
episodes involving both particulate matter and other
pollutants (Viana et al. 2003) at surface levels. The
mean PM 10 levels measured during these episodes
reach relatively high values (35-40 μg m [−][3] ).

Mediterranean transport was more evident during the
months of April, August and December and intermediate mean PM 10 levels were recorded (≈35 μg m [−][3] ). In
many cases, this transport is also related to North
African events since they usually have a common
origin, a fact that would explain the high levels of
PM 10 observed at both sites.
Mean concentrations from North African transport
events exceeded 35 μg m [−][3] at both sites. As already
stated, this transport explains many of the observed
exceedances of the established EU limit. Although its
frequency is low (9% of the days), its influence is
high affecting, in some cases, both Southwestern
Atlantic and Mediterranean transport. NAF transport
is most frequent in March and June during which the
highest PM concentrations were obtained, whereas
autumn episodes have much lower PM concentrations. Rain episodes occurring simultaneously with
dust outbreaks during this period may result in
observed lower PM levels.

Local recirculation events were observed throughout the study period, although they were often found
to be most frequent in the summer months. The mean
PM 10 concentrations associated with these events
were around 35 μg m [−][3] (Fig. 7).
Finally, transport of Atlantic air masses towards thestudy area resulted in relatively low PM 10 levels 20
25 μg m [−][3] (Fig. 7) due to the renovation of regionally

polluted air masses and also to the frequent rainfall
associated with these events.

#### Ozone

Measured mean ozone levels during the study period
(3 years) were 45.2 and 55.1 μg m [−][3] in Pamplona and
Alsasua, respectively. By observing the mean O 3
concentrations for the different years for both sites
(Table 4), one notes that these progressively increased
along the study period up to annual means of 50 and
62 μg m [−][3] for Pamplona and Alsasua, respectively,
for 2003 (last complete year in the study period).
The European Directive for ozone (2002/3/EC)
(EU 2002) establishes three different thresholds for
protecting human health: information and alert thresh

olds for the population, and target values for the
protection of human health. The information and alert
thresholds are fixed at 180 and 240 μg m [−][3] (1 h
averages), respectively. These limits were exceeded
on five and four occasions, respectively, during the
study period in Alsasua all of which occurred in July
2001. No exceedances of these limits were recorded

in Pamplona. Target values for the protection of
human health are fixed by the Directive at 120 μg
m [−][3] (maximum daily 8-h mean, objective value for
2010) and should not be exceeded on more than
25 days/calendar year averaged over 3 years. In
Alsasua, 51 exceedances of this limit were recorded
of which 7 were in 2001 (6 months of data), 18 in
2002 and 26 in 2003. There were no exceedances

recorded there in the first 6 months of 2004. All of the

exceedances were observed during the spring-summer-autumn period, but summer contributed 29 of the
51 exceedances. In Pamplona, 26 exceedances of this
limit were recorded, 4 of which were in 2002 and 24
in 2003. Just like in Alsasua, all of these exceedances
were observed during the spring-summer-autumn
period.
As can be seen in Fig. 8, ozone reached its maximum
values in summer, corresponding to periods of maximum insolation and minimum values were found in

winter. In Alsasua, the concentrations reached approximately 80 μg m [−][3] in July and August 2003. The
ozone levels recorded in Alsasua were slightly higher
than those observed in Pamplona but the temporal
tendencies were similar at both sites. This behavior has

been previously described by Monks (2000) for urban
and industrial sites. This characteristic tendency to
have maximum values in summer is attributable to

local photochemical production, while the origin of the
spring maximum observed in more remote areas is
more uncertain (Simpson 1995).

#### NO, NO 2 and SO 2

No exceedances of the 1999/30/CE limit values for

the NO, NO2, SO2 were recorded during the study
period. NO concentrations were approximately equal
at both sites (≈12 μg m [−][3], all averages calculated on a
monthly basis) and so were NO 2 concentrations
(≈26 μg m [−][3] ) (Table 4). This observation is probably
because the Alsasua sampling site was located less
than 10 m from a mildly busy city road. Differences
were observed in SO 2 values where the concentra

Fig. 8 Temporal variation
for ozone along the study
period for Pamplona and
Alsasua

tions in Pamplona were nearly double those in
Alsasua.

The NO seasonal variations (Fig. 9) reaches a
maximum in the winter when atmospheric stability is
greater and a minimum in summer when atmospheric
dispersion is most important. This observation has
also been reported by studies undertaken in other
European cities (Mayer 1999). The NO 2 seasonal
variations was similar to that of NO, although the
latter’s series was more constant. The NO 2 levels
depend mainly on chemical reactions and not on
direct emissions (Mayer 1999). The SO 2 seasonal
variations is more constant than either NO 2 or NO
and is similarly characterized by a winter maximum
and a summer minimum. The explanation for this
time series behavior may be similar to that given for
NO and NO 2 .

#### Comparison of levels with other cities

The measured PM 10 mean concentrations were within
(Pamplona) and slightly less than (Alsasua) the
normal range (30-45 μg m [−][3] ) for urban background
sites in Spain (Querol et al. 2004). The O 3 concentrations (annual average) were above those described
by Baldasano et al. (2003) for the major Spanish cities
(Barcelona, Madrid, Bilbao, Seville, Valencia,
Zaragoza), where the concentrations fall in the range
of 24-36 μg m [−][3], although these levels were mostly
either one year (1999) or two year annual means
(1999-2000; Barcelona and Valencia). The NO 2
values at both stations (∼26 μg m [−][3] ) are lower than
those reported by Baldasano et al. (2003) for the

146 Environ Monit Assess (2007) 134:137-151

Fig. 9 Average annual
cycles of NO, NO 2, SO 2
and O 3 for Pamplona (top)
and Alsasua (bottom)

major Spanish cities (50-63 μg m [−][3] ). NO concentrations (∼12 μg m [−][3] ) were less than the 2001 values
reported by Viana et al. (2003) for Llodio (Basque
Country) (20 μg m [−][3] ). Finally, SO 2 values were
within (Pamplona) and slightly lower than (Alsasua)
the values reported for the main Spanish cities.

#### Weekly and daily variation

As shown in Fig. 10, pollutant levels follow a
common pattern for each day with the exception of
weekends where the levels and the daily variation are
affected by the “weekend effect” that has been
described by several authors (Baldasano et al. 2005;

Pun et al. 2003; Riga-Karandinos and Saitanis 2005).
This effect will be discussed more thoroughly in a
subsequent section. In the case of NO, NO 2 and PM 10,
the daily variation is determined by traffic, since the
time series plots follow a typical traffic pattern
characterized by maximums during rush hours.
The daily PM 10 variations of levels in Alsasua
were characterized by a maximum in the morning
between 6 and 9 A.M. UTC and another maximum in

the evening between 6 and 7 P.M. corresponding to
traffic rush-hour times. However, these maxima vary
according to season of the year. In Pamplona, the
maxima occur about 1 h later, with the morning peak
appearing at about 9 A.M. and the evening peak at 8 P.M .

Environ Monit Assess (2007) 134:137-151 147

Fig. 10 Average weekly
and diurnal cycles of NO,
NO 2, SO 2, O 3 and PM 10 for
Pamplona (top) and Alsasua
(bottom)

In spring, the morning maximum occurs at 7 A.M. ; in
summer between 6 and 7 A.M. ; and in autumn and
winter at about 9 A.M. (UTC). The evening peak is less
pronounced than the morning peak and does not show
a clear seasonal pattern. The summer evening peak is
less pronounced than the rest of the year and can be
seen at later hours. The delay in the summer evening
peak is probably due to more dispersion of the
pollutants during the day in these summer months.
With the arrival of night, there is compression of the
boundary layer and hence, lower mixing height,
thereby leading to higher pollutant concentrations and
an evening maximum.
The daily dynamics of O 3 contrasts with that of
NO, NO 2 and PM 10 (Fig. 11), with the maximum O 3

levels corresponding with the minimums of NO, NO 2
and PM 10 and vice-versa. The daily cycle of O 3 at
both sites is typical of sites strongly influenced by
traffic. Two peaks are observed, the highest one
occurring in the early afternoon due to photochemical
formation processes. The second maximum occurs
during early morning hours and is likely to be a
consequence of transport of O 3 from elevated areas
(Mayer 1999). Usually, in rural sites with a relatively
smaller influence of traffic, the early morning maximum is not often observed. The minimum values in

both sites are observed at around 7 A.M. as a result of

the titration of ozone by the NO that is emitted by
morning traffic (Blum et al. 1997; Ribas and Penuelas
2004). Clearly, the ozone levels are higher during

O 3 and PM 10 for Pamplona

weekends, and the second maximum is less perceivable. These differences are a result of the “weekend

effect” whose main cause is the reduction of traffic

during the weekends. The decrease in NOx emissions
during weekends may allow the build up of O 3
because of reduced titration by the emitted NO and/or
reduced formation of HNO 3 . In addition, there may be
somewhat increased solar radiance at ground level
during weekends because of the decreased soot
emissions from heavy-duty trucks and industrial
sources that do not operate on the weekends. In
addition, the lack of morning rush-hour traffic on
weekends allows ozone concentrations to begin rising
from a significantly higher concentration, Therefore,
higher overall weekend concentrations may occur
(Riga-Karandinos et al. 2006).
The variations of NO 2 and NO concentrations are
similar to that of PM 10 with coinciding maxima. The
levels of both pollutants (NO 2 and NO) are apprecia

bly higher during the weekdays than during the
weekend because of the higher traffic density during
weekdays (“weekend effect”) (Fig. 10). Also, the
diurnal pattern of these species (NO and NO 2 ) is
affected on weekends by less traffic as indicated by
their less regular cycles. The variations in weekends
are greater for NO than for NO 2 because NO 2 has a
longer residence time than NO (Mayer 1999). Also, it
can be seen that during the weekdays, the concentration of NO is appreciably higher in the morning than
in the afternoon. The morning rush-hour time is
usually shorter and the ground level atmosphere is
more stable than in the evening resulting in higher
values. The low NO concentrations in the early
afternoon result mainly from the reaction of NO with
O 3 (Mayer 1999).
Finally, the daily dynamics of SO 2 is less pronounced than the other pollutants, reaching a maximum during mid-day hours in Alsasua. In Pamplona

this dynamics are more defined. During the week, in
Pamplona, two maxima are observed coinciding with
the maxima of NO, NO 2 and PM 10 as well as a
smaller maximum coinciding with the ozone maximum. It can also be seen that SO 2 levels slightly
decrease during the weekend.
Using a students’ t-test, the weekdays/weekend
differences between pollutant levels in Pamplona
were found to be statistically significant for NO,

differences were observed for all pollutants except for
O 3, which was close to being significant (Table 6).
This statistical analysis demonstrates the existence of
the weekend effect and its influence on the weekly
dynamics of the various pollutants.

#### Other factors that determine the levels and temporal

variation of the pollutants

As previously seen, the concentrations and variations
in the concentrations of various pollutants in Pamplona and Alsasua are a consequence of factors that
include natural and anthropogenic emissions, and
meteorological regimes. Traffic noticeably influences
the concentrations and variation of the pollutants. The
accumulation of pollutants in winter was a result of
the greater atmospheric stability as well as the
influence of other factors. Precipitation levels also
influence ambient PM levels. The observed variations

in PM 10 concentrations during the study period were
inversely related to precipitation amounts (Fig. 12).
Precipitation reduces reintrainment from roads and
leads to wash-out of PM from the atmosphere during
rainy period, especially in Alsasua due to its higher
annual precipitation.
Also, wind direction as well as wind speed has an
important influence on pollution. Vignati et al. (1996)
found that in two cities with comparable emissions
(Copenhagen and Milan), the pollution levels were
found to be much higher in Milan because of the
greater frequency of low wind speeds. Also, it has
been observed that a fairly strong wind speed of
8 ms [−][1] in narrow streets causes a reduction, up to
half, in the NO 2 concentration during rush hours
(Fenger 1999). As shown in Fig. 13, the variation of
the pollutant concentrations were inversely related to
wind speed, with the maximum levels of NO, NO 2,
SO 2 and PM 10 corresponding with the minimum wind
speed and vice-versa. Thus, ventilation and dilution
were driven by the average wind speed.

### Conclusions

The annual mean PM 10 levels in both sites were
within (Pamplona, 30 μg m [−][3] ) and slightly less than
(Alsasua, 28 μg m [−][3] ) the usual range of PM 10 levels
for urban background sites in Spain. The annual mean
levels are in compliance with the established 2005
limit. With respect to the number of exceedances of
the daily PM 10 limit, with the exception of the year
2001 in Alsasua, the 2005 limit would not be
exceeded. The number of exceedances of the daily

PM 10 limit as well as the PM 10 temporal variation are
greatly influenced by air masses from North Africa.
In 68% of the days, both stations were influenced
by Atlantic transport patterns; 13% by European
transport patterns; 9% by North African transport;
7% by local transport; and 3% by Mediterranean
transport. The highest PM 10 levels resulted during
North African transport episodes.
The mean O 3 concentrations were 45 and 55 μg m [−][3]

in Pamplona and Alsasua, respectively. These concentrations are above those reported by other authors for
the main Spanish cities. The informational and alert
thresholds for the population were exceeded on five
and four occasions, respectively, in Alsasua in 2001.
The mean NO and NO 2 levels were approximately
equal at 12 and 26 μg m [−][3], respectively, in both sites.
Mean SO 2 levels were 8 μg m [−][3] in Pamplona and
5 μg m [−][3] in Alsasua. No exceedances of the
established limits were registered for any of the three
pollutants (NO, NO 2, and SO 2 ) and their levels were
less than those reported for the main Spanish cities,
with the exception of SO 2 in Pamplona, which was
within the reported values.
The daily variations of all the pollutants were
largely determined by the traffic patterns. PM 10, NO
and NO 2 showed similar variations with two coincident maximums during traffic rush hours. The daily
variations of ozone were opposite to that of PM 10, NO
and NO 2, and reached a maximum during the midday
hours. The SO 2 variations were less well defined.
This study has also demonstrated the existence and
role of the “weekend effect” on influencing the
different pollutant levels and variations in both sites.
This study has found a clear relationship between
the wind speed and the daily dynamics of the different
pollutants, as well as the relationship between the
seasonal PM 10 variation and the reported precipitation
levels.
