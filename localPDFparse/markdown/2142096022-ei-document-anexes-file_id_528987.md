ORBIT INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONS MANUAL

**1.** **SAFETY**

Before installing and using the PC pump, carefully read the instructions provided below. This manual
contains fundamental instructions that must be followed during installation, operation and maintenance.
This manual must be consulted by all qualified personnel who will follow the pumps operation and
installation. In addition, this manual must always be available at the location where the pump is used.

Failure to respect the safety rules may cause physical and material damage, failure of the installation or the
pump's principal functions; compromised maintenance operations; mechanical or electrical damage; injury
to people as well as environmental pollution. Failure to observe safety rules can void the warranty.

This is the safety alert symbol, take special note of literature in this manual highlighted with
this symbol. This symbol warns about hazards that may cause serious personal injury, death
or property damage if ignored.

**2.** **GENERAL INFORMATION**

This manual covers operation and important recommendations for the correct operation of the pump. It is
necessary to respect these recommendations in order to maximize the pumps reliability, longevity, as well
as to avoid the risk of accident resulting from improper use. The pump must never be used outside the
limitations described in the technical specifications. It is necessary to respect the instructions regarding
product nature; density; viscosity; temperature; flow rate; pressure; speed; direction of rotation; power of

motor as well as all other instructions contained in this manual or in the documentation attached to the

contract.

The manufacturer declines all responsibility in the case of accident or damage caused by negligence,
Improper use of the pump or the failure to observe the instructions provided in this manual or use under
conditions other than those stated in the name plate data.

ORBIT INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONS MANUAL

**3.** **INSTALLATION RECOMMENDATIONS**

At the pumping system design stage, consideration must be given for the provision of dedicated gauges,
filling or flushing connections, non-return, isolating or pressure relief valves. Due to the nature of a positive
displacement pump, it is recommended a pressure relief valve is installed on the outlet side of the pump to
prevent any danger and or damage in the event the flow out of the pump becomes blocked.

**3.1** **IMPORTANT**

 - For ease of maintenance, the correct dismantling space must be provided (refer to the
pump dimension sheet).

 - All bolts and nuts securing flanges and base mounting fixtures must be checked for
tightness before operation.

 - All pipework should be independently supported.

 - To eliminate vibration, the pump must be correctly aligned with the drive unit, all guards must
be securely fixed in position, and mounted on a suitable baseplate.

 - When commissioning the plant, all joints in the system must be thoroughly checked for leaks.

 - Suction pipework must be clean to prevent trap material from damaging the pump. As
an added precaution a temporary strainer may be fitted.

**NEVER RUN THE PUMP WITH A CLOSED INLET OR OUTLET VALVE.**

ORBIT INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONS MANUAL

**6.** **PUMPS SUPPLIED FOR FOOD APPLICATIONS**

For pumps intended for food/hygienic applications, it is imperative that the correct material selection is
applied. It is important that a clean in place treatment is executed on the pump at the following times (in
addition to the standard CIP plan during normal pump operation):

1. When the pump is first commissioned for use.

2. When any spare components are fitted/replaced.

Hypalon stators should not be used in applications where product is destined for human
consumption. Hygienic applications do require stainless steel pump components. Contact
Franklin Electric for more information regarding use of food grade grease for specialized
applications.

**7.** **MOTOR WIRING ARRANGEMENT**

This PD pump requires a high starting torque to overcome the rotor stator friction fit. To achieve this the
motor must be started direct on line (DOL) to realize maximum starting torque. Star-delta starting is not
recommended. Higher power motors, requiring starting currents in excess of supply capability need to be
powered using variable frequency drives (VFD).

Star-Delta and reduced voltage (soft starters) are not recommended for PD pumps.

Consideration must be given to applications using electronic variable frequency drives, these systems:

1. Must make use of VFDs with full torque rating at start-up (as opposed to a square law drive) or

2. Use a larger motor than required according to selection (to offer greater starting torque at
standstill) when operating direct online.

For applications where the motor will not be operating at full frequency, derating the motor must be
accounted for to cope with torque demands within the required RPM range.

Test the motor rotation direction to ensure it is correct as required for pump operation.

Failure to follow this guidance may result in the pump not starting, not being capable of producing the
required duties or lead to motor failure.

7

ORBIT INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONS MANUAL

**8.** **STARTING**

Pumps must be filled with liquid / product before startup. This initial filling is not for priming purposes but to
provide the necessary lubrication for the stator until the pump primes itself.

When the pump is stopped, sufficient liquid is normally trapped within rotor stator set to provide lubrication
on following startup. If the pump has been standing for a long period of time, or has just been moved to a
new location, or has been dismantled for examination it must be filled with liquid and be given a few turns
by hand before starting. The pump is normally somewhat stiff (dependant on the model) to tum by hand on
account of the close fit between the rotor and the rubber stator. If on start up, the pump does not operate
correctly, the plant must be shut down immediately and the cause of the malfunction established before
operations are recommenced.

Never run the pump in a dry condition, even for a few revolutions or the stator will be
damaged.

Startup check list:

1. With the motor isolated from the pump, ensure that its rotation is the correct direction.

2. Are there any obstructions in the pipework or pump?

3. Are the pump connections and pipework points tight and leak free?

4. Have the inlet and outlet protective plugs been removed?

5. Is there lubrication in the drive unit / gearbox?

6. Does the product seal require a flushing arrangement?

7. Is the gland follower loose (If packed gland version)?

8. Is motor voltage correct?

9. For V-belt arrangement, is belt tension correct? Rule of thumb is 16mm deflection ("d") per 1m
belt length.

8

ORBIT INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONS MANUAL

10. For coupling arrangement, are shafts aligned?

11. Are the pipework valves open?

12. Are all safety guards in place?

13. Is the pump filled with 'product' to provide lubrication between the rotor and stator on start up?

14. Start then stop the pump; is the pump rotating in the correct direction?

The pump speed / pressure settings must remain below the pumps maximum limitations.
Consult Franklin Electric if you are unsure.

If the pump has never been run, it may be necessary to crank the pump through one revolution manually
(with water/product present in the gland). This can be achieved by using an adjustable wrench fitted at the

drive shaft.

**9.** **GUARDS**

In accordance with the Health & Safety Act, all guards must be secured after installation,
maintenance or any adjustments have been made to the pump.

**10. ROTATION**

The B-Range of Industrial pumps is suitable for rotation in either direction, i.e. flow direction out either of
the pump flanges. The bearing housing direction plate indicates the resultant flow path dependent on
mainshaft rotation direction. Pump flow curves also indicate flow direction.

NOTE: It is recommended product flow is directed out the “end cover” (opposite drive end) side of the
pump in applications where:

 - Pressure above 10 bar is required (dependant on pump capabilities)

 - No suction lift is required. For Suction lift applications, delivery must be on gland.

**13. DISMANTLING**

Before any maintenance work is carried out on the pump, ensure that the pump is isolated from the
electrical supply and that the pump's main isolating valves on the inlet and outlet are closed.
Ensure that the system is de-pressurised.

Where hazardous fluids are pumped, the pump must be flushed and drained before the
dismantling. Personnel dismantling the pump must wear protective clothing throughout the
dismantling procedure.

If the pump has been out of operation for more than one hour, it will assist dismantling if the rotor is given a slight
turn, thereby breaking the rotor/stator seal. Where a pump has been out of operation for a longer period of time,
dismantling can be facilitated by lubricating the rotor/stator assembly with water through the filling plug holes,
and rotating the rotor.

To dismantle the pump, follow the below sequence (reference to Figure 1 : Exploded view):

1. Remove bolts holding end cover (01) to baseplate/foundation.

2. Loosen tie rod nuts and tie rods (39)

3. Remove end cover (01).

4. Remove stator (05). It may be necessary to rotate mainshaft (21) with suitable spanner while
gripping stator (05) to assist with this operation.

5. Remove pin cap guard (20) at drive shaft end.

6. Remove drive end pin cap (24) and lock washer (23) and withdraw coupling pin (25) with pliers.

7. The rotor (04) with attached coupling rod (28) can now be removed by pulling away from the
mainshaft (21).

8. Loosen 4 hex bolts (55) holding porting chamber (08) to bearing housing (12). Loosen gland hex
nuts (50).

9. Porting chamber (08) and loose gland (37) can now be removed.

10. Loosen hex bolts (54) and remove bearing cover (19) at drive end.

11. Withdraw the mainshaft (21). Bearings (17) and lipseal (34) will pull-out with mainshaft (21).

Refer to Figure 1 : Exploded view :

1. Assemble bearings (17) on mainshaft (21) with bearing spacer (16) in between, and bearing lock
washer (14) on open end.

2. Fasten bearings (17) on mainshaft (21) with bearing lock nut (13). See 15.3 BEARINGS for
bearing settings. Ensure bearings (17) are greased liberally.

3. Insert the mainshaft assembly (21) in bearing housing (12).

4. Bolt bearing cover (19) to bearing housing (12) with hex bolts (54).

5. Install lip seal (34) and drive end lip seal (34A). Lip seal opening must face inwards.

6. Install thrower / flinger (11) on mainshaft.

7. Place gland follower (10), and then loose gland (37) onto mainshaft (21) from gland end.

8. Place gasket (88) in gland section (08) recess, and bolt gland section to bearing housing (12).
Flange can be positioned in any orientation.

9. Install gland packing (09) into loose gland section (37). Packing must be inserted with each
consecutive packing rotated 180°. Gland follower (10) can be tightened in place loosely. Gland
follower (10) must be tightened once pump is running, it must be tightened such that the gland
continues to drip (a drip a second). See 15.1 GLAND PACKING.

10. Fit seal rings (27) onto coupling rod (28) by greasing rod joint ends and pulling them over at each
end by hand.

11. Fit one pin cap (24) in rotor (04) end with lock washer (23). Lock lockwasher (23) by folding wide
tab up against pin cap (24) and folding the narrow tab into rotor head groove - see illustration
below. Always replace a damaged or missing lock washer (23) and or seal ring (27), this will
prevent grease leakage from the joint and increase pump service intervals.

ORBIT INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONS MANUAL

16. Bend locking tabs on the pin cap lock washers as per step 9.

17. Fit stator (05) ensuring it seals up against porting chamber (08). Rotate stator (05) while rotor (04)
is held stationary to assist with fitment. One can use water, silicone grease or a rubber compatible
liquid as a lubricant on rotor to assist with fitment of stator.

18. Refit end cover (01) and tie rods (39). Tie rods must be tightened sequentially to ensure an even
clamp between the stator and adjacent castings. Tighten rods according to sequence below
repeating the cycle 3 times until the correct torque rating is achieved. See torque chart below.

**15. ROUTINE MAINTENANCE**

To ensure optimum pump life the following components should be routinely checked:

1. **Gland Packing** (refer to _15.1 GLAND PACKING_ ).

2. **Universal Joints** - Joints should be greased every 500 - 1,000 running hours but this period could
be more or less depending on duty conditions. Castrol Spheerol LMM or equivalent grease to be
used for this purpose.

3. **Pins** - Pin wear can be detected by rocking the pump driving pulley or coupling to determine the
amount of free play. If the angular deflection is excessive (greater than 5°) the universal joints
should be replaced (refer to 13. DISMANTLING).

4. **Bearings** - Bearings should be cleaned and regreased every 5,000 hours.

**15.1 GLAND PACKING**

The gland packing supplied as a standard in these pumps is manufactured from a non-asbestos material
(PTFE or cotton graphite). The gland will require adjustment during the initial running-in period. Under normal
working conditions a slight drip from the gland is essential and assists in lubricating the packing.

It is usual to replace gland packing when re-assembling a pump. Clean the box and shaft thoroughly and
examine mainshaft (21) for wear and scoring. Replace shaft if its wear is excessive. Install one ring at a time.
Make sure it is clean, and has not picked up any dirt in handling. Joins of successive rings should be staggered
and kept at least 90 degrees apart.

After the last ring is installed, take up bolts finger tight. Do not jam the packing into place by excessive gland
loading. Start pump, allow packing to leak freely. Excessive leakage during the first hour of operation will result
in a better packing operation over a longer period of time. Take up gradually on the gland as the packing seats,
until leakage is reduced to a tolerable level, preferably 8-10 drops per minute per inch of shaft diameter.
Stopping leakage entirely at this point will cause the packing to burn up. A gland which is too tight can be
detected by insufficient leakage and excessive heat in gland area and should be slackened off.

**15.2 COUPLING RODS AND UNIVERSAL JOINTS**

The universal joints of the coupling rod are designed such that any wear occurring at these points bears on
small, inexpensive and easily replaceable bushes.

17

ORBIT INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONS MANUAL

The universal joints are protected by rubber seal rings to retain the grease inside the joint.

The following models utilize bushes: 61M, 62M, 61MB, 62MB, 61MCR, 71M, 72M, 81M, 82M,
81MCR, 91M, 92M, 101M, 111M.The renewable bushes (26) in the coupling rod can be pressed out and
replacements inserted. When replacing the bushes it is imperative they are aligned such that the
hole elongation lies directed along the length of the coupling rod as per image below. Failure to do this
will result in component damage.

**15.3 BEARINGS**

Bearings are removed from the shaft by following steps in 13. DISMANTLING.

**RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE FOR SETTING THE CORRECT RUNNING CLEARANCES IN THE**

**BEARINGS.**

1. After assembling the bearings (17) and bearing spacer (16) onto the shaft, place the assembly in a
vertical position and align the bearing cups and spacer to run concentric with the shaft axis (using
straight edge or steel ruler).

2. Rotate the bearing cups and spacer by hand and tighten the locknut until resistance is felt in the
bearing assembly. At this point all free running clearance is eliminated. (This operation should be
carried out with bearings 'dry', i.e. no grease, only a protective coating).

3. The locknut should now be loosened to give correct running clearance (see table below).

4. The tab of the lock washer should now be bent into a corresponding slot on the locknut.

5. Bearing Lubrication - The taper roller bearings should be packed with Castrol Spheerol EP2
grease or equivalent and the housing 1/3 filled.

Bearings should be cleaned and re-packed with grease every 5,000 hours.

**24. WARRANTY**

**This document contains Franklin Electric Co., Inc. and all of its subsidiaries (collectively, "Franklin Electric")**
**standard limited warranty, general sales policies and controlling terms and conditions for Submersible Pump**
**(the "Goods"). This document shall not be altered or amended except as provided by Franklin Electric.**

Limited Warranty

Franklin Electric warrants that for a period of one (1) year from the date of delivery, the goods purchased will:

(a) Be free from defects in workmanship and material at the time of shipment;

(b) Perform consistently with samples previously supplied; and

(c) Conform to the specifications published or agreed to in writing between the customer and Franklin Electric.

This limited warranty is in lieu of all other warranties, written or oral, statutory, express, or implied, including any warranty
of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for Franklin Electric's breach
of its obligations hereunder, including breach of any express or implied warranty or in a written instrument made of this
limited warranty, shall be for the purchase price paid to Franklin Electric for the non-conforming or defective product or
for the repair or replacement of non-conforming or defective product, at Franklin Electric's election.

Any Franklin Electric product which Franklin Electric determines to be defective within the warranty period shall be, at
Franklin Electric's sole option, repaired or replaced, provided that Franklin Electric's obligation to repair or replace shall
be subject to the following conditions:

(a) Any allegedly defective goods or parts shall have been returned to Franklin Electric at the customer's

expense;

(b) The customer shall establish in writing to the reasonable satisfaction of Franklin Electric that the goods
have been properly used and applied for normal purposes;

(c) No person, whether authorised by the customer or not, shall have tampered with the goods or parts or
shall have attempted to rectify the alleged defect in the goods or parts in any way before the inspection
thereof by representatives of Franklin Electric; and

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, whether or not Franklin Electric has repaired or
replaced alleged defective goods, Franklin Electric shall be entitled at any time to refund the purchase
price of any allegedly defective goods to the customer and such refund shall be in full and final settlement
of such customer's claim in respect of the allegedly defective goods.

Without limiting the generality of the exclusions of this limited warranty, Franklin Electric does not warrant the adequacy
of any specifications provided directly or indirectly by a customer or that Franklin Electric's products will perform in
accordance with such specifications.

ORBIT INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONS MANUAL

This limited warranty does not apply to:

(a) Any goods that have been subject to misuse (including use in a manner inconsistent with the design of the
product), abuse, neglect, accident or improper installation or maintenance; and

(b) Any goods that have been altered or repaired by any person or entity other than Franklin Electric or its
authorised representatives;

(c) Any goods not manufactured by Franklin Electric unless Franklin Electric is entitled to the benefit of the
same or similar undertaking, mutatis mutandis from the supplier or manufacturer thereof. In such case,
Franklin Electric's liability to the customer for such goods shall be limited to Franklin Electric's benefit from
the supplier or manufacturer thereof.

Stated performance figures are based on Franklin Electric's testing experience. Franklin Electric shall not be liable for
any loss or damaged incurred or sustained by the customer as a result of the customer's reliance on such figures unless
Franklin Electric shall in writing, have:

(a) Guaranteed such performance figures within specified tolerances; and

(b) Agreed to pay a penalty or liquidated damages in the event of such performance figures not being
achieved, in which event Franklin Electric's liability shall be strictly limited to the amount of such agreed
upon penalty or damages.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Franklin Electric shall not be liable, under any circumstances, for:

(a) Any loss of trade or profit occurring to the customer in the event of the delivery of goods being frustrated
or delayed by acts of God or force majeure such as, but not limited to, strikes, riots, lockouts, trade
disputes, fire, war, mobilisation, military conscription, confiscation, uprising, trade embargoes, shortage of
raw materials, or by any other cause beyond Franklin Electric's control, and

(b) Loss of profit or any special, incidental or consequential damages whatsoever whether arising from breach
of contract, delict, negligence, or from any other cause, even if Franklin Electric shall have been advised of
the possibility of such potential loss or damage.
