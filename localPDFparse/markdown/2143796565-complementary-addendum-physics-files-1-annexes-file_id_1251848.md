issolved oxygen (DO) is the most fundamental
parameter in water. This double-bonded, two# D atom molecule is essential to the metabolism of all

aerobic aquatic organisms. Air contains approximately
20.9% oxygen gas by volume. The proportion of oxygen
in air that dissolves in water is about 35%. This solubility
is governed by atmospheric and hydrostatic pressure,
turbulence, temperature, salinity, currents, upwellings, ice
cover, and biological processes (Wetzel 1983). At any
given barometric pressure and temperature (and the
corresponding water vapour pressure), the oxygen partial
pressures can be calculated; the solubility of oxygen in
freshwater at 5oC and 101.3 kPa (i.e., standard
atmospheric pressure) is 12.77 mg·L [-1] .

Major sources of DO in water are the atmosphere and
photosynthesis by aquatic vegetation. The amount of
oxygen available for aquatic life, however, depends on the
factors that affect its solubility. The saturation
concentration of DO is quickly achieved at the air-water
interface, and in shallow moving water, will be relatively
consistent throughout the water column.

In large and deep freshwater systems, oxygenation
depends on circulation by winds, currents, and inflows to
move aerated water away from the surface. At spring
turnover, the water column is near 100% saturation for
both oligotrophic (i.e., low nutrient level) and eutrophic
(i.e., high nutrient level) lakes. With increased summer
temperatures, the DO concentration and solubility in the
circulating epilimnion (warm upper water layer)
decreases. Conversely, a temperature decline in the
metalimnion (mixing water layer) and hypolimnion (cold
lower water layer) causes the oxygen concentration to
increase, and the level of saturation will be close to 100%
with increasing depth. In most situations, however, the
settling of organic matter into the deeper areas from the
productive zones could result in undersaturation as a
result of oxidation processes.

In shallower waters, the bulk of oxygen loss that is
attributable to oxidation occurs at the sediment-water

interface, where bacterial activity and organic matter are
concentrated. A considerable amount of oxygen is also
lost in the water column by bacterial, plant, and animal
respiration, particularly in deep lakes. Oxygen depletion
also occurs by direct chemical oxidation of dissolved

organic matter. In eutrophic lakes, hypolimnion depletion
may progress to complete anaerobic conditions shortly
after summer stratification, resulting in a shift to anaerobic
bacterial metabolism and slower decomposition. Fall
cooling of epilimnial waters breaks down the density
barrier at the thermocline (layer at which water
temperature changes drastically), resulting in a turnover.
In the winter, ice formation prevents the exchange of
atmospheric oxygen, and the concentration profile for an
idealized oligotrophic lake is constant at saturation
relative to depth. Again, biotic influences of respiration
and oxidation are normally present and there is a
reduction in oxygen concentration with depth. In
eutrophic lakes, the photic zone is reduced, but can remain
active where sufficient light penetration through ice
continues and the normal consumptive demands are
lessened by cooler temperatures. The resultant oxygen
profile showing depletion at depth is similar to, but more
gradual than, that for summer stratification (Wetzel 1983).

There are other important mechanisms that control oxygen
levels in the littoral zone (shallow area close to shoreline),
which can be quite different from those of the pelagic
zone (open, deep water). For example, well-developed
stands of aquatic macrophytes and associated periphytons
will substantially raise oxygen levels during
photosynthesis and consume oxygen during respiration at
night. This diurnal event also gives rise to a diel cycle due
to the net production of oxygen during the growth
seasons. Late in the year, much of the macrophyte
standing crop dies back to the root crown, and the
concomitant decomposition can cause a prolonged oxygen
demand extending beyond the littoral areas.

The DO content in water is largely controlled by the
balance between input of oxygen and consumptive
metabolism of oxidizable matter received. Anthropogenic
influences (industrial, including deforestation,
agricultural, and municipal wastes) tend to load the latter
scale by the addition of organic effluents. The depletion of
DO in receiving waters is often a ready indicator of
wastewater treatment requirements. Specific empirical
procedures have been devised to measure oxygen demand.
Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is a standard
microbial incubation procedure that measures the oxygen
required to oxidize organic material and certain inorganic
materials over a given period of time. Alternatively, the
measure for the amount of oxygen required to chemically
oxidize reduced minerals and organic matter of a sample
is termed chemical oxygen demand (COD). Both terms
are applied to the level of reducing material present from
a combination of natural and anthropogenic sources. They
have particular usefulness in assessing the potential effects
of effluents. Wastes that are primarily nutrient-related
and/or high in carbon may enhance or deplete DO levels.
They commonly do both, depending on the location in the
water column. Additional oxygen is usually produced in
the photic zone by increased primary production
following enhancement by inorganic nitrogen and
phosphorus. A subsequent drop in the nutrient supply,
however, can be accompanied by algal die-off,
decomposition, and oxygen depletion (Wetzel 1983).

DO in surface waters may range from nondetectable to
18.4 mg·L [-1] (NAQUADAT 1985). In lakes it may be
influenced by climatic conditions (e.g., ice cover),
morphometry (e.g., depth), productivity, and watershed
characteristics (e.g., oxygen sources and nonpoint source
loading of organic material). These characteristics can
vary tremendously, both temporally and spatially.
Generally, variations in oxygen levels are not a result of
point source discharges.

Interstitial and sediment oxygen concentrations are highly
variable. They can markedly differ from the overlying
water due to a number of independent variables that
include surface and interstitial water velocity/discharge,
hydraulic gradient, sediment texture and porosity, bottom
morphology, daily water temperature fluctuation, and the
consumptive oxygen demand of the substrate. In standing
water environments, interactions between the diverse
sediment biota and the concentration of the particulate
organic material are the major cause of oxygen depletion
(both through respiration and release of decomposition
byproducts in reduced form). Oxygen itself, however, will
regulate important redox reactions at the sedimentwater interface. Oxygen penetration into the substrate
from the water column is governed by the rate of
turbulence of superficial sediments and by the oxygen
demand per unit volume. Typically, diffusion from even
well-aerated water will supply only the top few
centimetres (Wetzel 1983). In some cases, filter-feeding
organisms can introduce oxygen to greater depths by
physically reworking compacted, oxygen-deficient mud
and extending the habitat range. Similarly, in riverine
environments, the act of redd construction by salmonids
through excavation and backfilling results in localized
dispersal of fine sediments and increased interstitial flows
for improved oxygen delivery to buried eggs.

**Water Quality Guideline Derivation**

Toxicological methods for measuring the effects of
chemicals on aquatic life have been standardized for many
years. Basically, these methodologies involve the addition
of a chemical in varying concentrations to determine the
concentration at which the chemical has an effect or no

effect. In contrast, for DO it is the lack of oxygen rather
than an excess of oxygen that causes adverse effects. Also,
the types of toxicity endpoints vary; for acute exposure,
they include mortality, loss of equilibrium, and lack of
opercular movement. The exposure times for these shortterm tests also vary widely (Chapman 1986). For chronic
exposure, endpoints include the traditional growth and
reproduction impairment parameters, oxygen
uptake/consumption, and swimming capacity. The low
oxygen threshold at which some reaction first becomes
apparent is usually referred to as the incipient or critical
level. At this level, the organism must extend or adjust its
available energies to counteract the influence of hypoxia
(oxygen starvation). When this stress is a chronic
occurrence, it could have a detrimental effect on longterm survival. This, or any departure from a “no-effect”
level, can be considered an undesirable risk (Davis 1975).
The variability in toxicity endpoints and exposure times
challenges the derivation of water quality guidelines for
DO, and as a result, the guideline derivation does not
follow the standard CCME protocol (CCME 1991). Two
supporting documents (AEP 1997 and Truelson 1997)
were used to develop these guidelines.

**Freshwater Life**

Reduced oxygen levels have been shown to cause lethal
and sublethal (physiological and behavioural) effects in
various organisms, especially fish. Younger fish tended to

**Canadian Water Quality Guidelines** **DISSOLVED OXYGEN**
**for the Protection of Aquatic Life** **(Freshwater)**

be more sensitive than older fish (Doudoroff and
Shumway 1970; Alabaster and Lloyd 1982). A more
recent study on yellow perch supported this general
finding (Johnson and Evans 1991). In contrast, adult
graylings were more sensitive to low DO levels than fry.
At the same water temperature, adults lost equilibrium at
DO concentrations 0.4 mg·L [-1] higher than fry (Feldmeth
and Eriksen 1978). Furthermore, weight and size had no
significant effect on the critical DO concentration of
several species (Smale and Rabeni 1995). Acclimation to
low DO concentration decreased the lethal concentration

(Doudoroff and Shumway 1970). The incipient lethal
concentration was determined in situ in three lakes in

Ontario. For northern pike, the incipient lethal limit was
<0.75 mg ⋅ L [-1] DO for all three lakes. Northern pike were
extremely tolerant to low DO winter concentrations; some
were found alive at 0.04 mg·L [-1] (Casselman 1978).
Observed lethal oxygen levels generally increased at
higher water temperatures (Doudoroff and Shumway
1970; EIFAC 1973; USEPA 1986). Mortality and/or loss
of equilibrium occurred between 1 and 3 mg·L [-1] .

For chronic exposures, low DO reduced the growth of
coho salmon (Mason 1969), mountain whitefish (Siefert et
al. 1974), smallmouth bass (Siefert et al. 1974), lake trout
(Carlson and Siefert 1974), and lake herring (Brooke and
Colby 1980). Alabaster and Lloyd (1982) concluded from
reviewing the information available at that time that a
minimum value of 5 mg·L [-1] would be satisfactory for most
stages and activities in the life cycle of fish. Processes
such as juvenile growth, fecundity, hatch of eggs, larval
morphology and survival, upstream movement of
migratory salmon, and schooling behaviour of some
species were not particularly susceptible to DO levels
above 5 mg·L [-1] . However, the authors stated that the
5 mg·L [-1] value might be necessarily high merely to ensure
satisfactory survival of fish and adequate survival of
juveniles.

Doudoroff and Shumway’s (1970) review indicated that
low DO during embryonic development resulted in
delayed development and increased mortality as embryos
aged. In fish species other than salmonids, low DO in
some instances resulted in mortality and delayed
development. Alabaster and Lloyd (1982) concluded that
any reduction of DO from air saturation value could slow
development and embryonic growth, or delay hatching in
salmonids. Most salmonid embryos will hatch successfully
between 2 and 3 mg·L [-1] DO to produce relatively small
and underdeveloped larvae that are viable and not
deformed. Reduction of hatching success, however, can
even occur at concentrations >3 mg·L [-1] . At

low DO concentrations, hatching of fathead minnows
(Brungs 1971), walleye (Oseid and Smith 1971), mountain
whitefish (Siefert et al _._ 1974), white suckers (Siefert and
Spoor 1974), lake trout (Carlson and Siefert 1974), scale carp
(Kaur and Toor 1978), lake herring (Brooke and Colby
1980), and burbot (Giles et al. 1996) was delayed.

Fish compensate for hypoxia by several behavioural
responses: increased use of air breathing or aquatic
surface respiration (ASR), changes in activity level or
habitat, and avoidance behaviour. Birtwell (1989)
reported that much of a chum salmon run was prevented
as a result of low DO. Migrating salmon avoided DO
levels of 3.5-5 mg·L [-1] (Birtwell and Kruzynski 1989).
McGreer and Vigers (1983) found avoidance reaction in
juvenile chum salmon up to 10 km from a pulp mill,
partially as a result of severely depleted DO conditions in
an inlet. Walleye in their second summer remained in the
shade at DO >5.5 mg·L [-1] (Scherer 1971). However, at DO
levels <5.5 mg·L [-1], walleye increased mobility into higher
light intensities. Below 2 mg·L [-1], walleye remained longer
in higher light conditions.

Low DO during embryonic development could result in
structural deformities (Doudoroff and Shumway 1970).
Exposure of chum salmon embryos to 0.3 mg·L [-1] DO
resulted in shortening of the vertebral column and
abnormal alevins (Alderdice et al _._ 1958). A level of
1 mg·L [-1] resulted in irreversible locked lower jaw of
largemouth bass larvae, making the fish unable to swim up
and feed (Spoor 1977). Exposure of steelhead trout eggs
to 2.6 mg·L [-1] DO resulted in significant abnormal
development, such as deformed tails and spines, and
abnormal nervous systems and brain development (Silver
et al _._ 1963). At 1-2 mg·L [-1], high numbers of lake herring
fry had deformed heads, jaws that did not articulate, and
irregular-shaped eyes (Brooke and Colby 1980).

The specific oxygen requirements of aquatic invertebrates
have been studied extensively. The great range of
tolerances identified is predictable for such a diverse
group. Organisms that can endure low oxygen conditions
are capable of some form of anaerobic metabolism (Davis
1975). Some invertebrates may have developed
physiological and behavioural adaptations: chironomid
larvae and leeches have the ability to acclimate by
regulating oxygen uptake; _Daphnia_ can produce
hemoglobin and turn red; _Gammarus_ can increase activity
and leave the low oxygen environment; and freshwater
snails usually lift themselves to the surface.

The acute toxicity data included data on seven
invertebrate species. The 2- to 5-h LC 50 values (expressed
as percentage saturation) varied from 5.2% for the mayfly
_Siphlonurus aestivalis_ to 49.5% for the mayfly
_Rhithrogena iridina_ (0.5-5.3 mg·L [-1] at an assumed
atmospheric pressure of 101.3 kPa) (Jacob and Walther
1981). For 22 species, the 2- to 5-h LC 50 values
(expressed as percent saturation) varied from 0.3% for the
mayfly _Ephemera vulgata_ to 96.5% for the mayfly
_Epeorus sylvicola_ (0.03-8.77 mg·L [-1] at an assumed
atmospheric pressure of 101.3 kPa) (Jacob et al. 1984).

Chronic effects of low DO have been studied for various

species of invertebrates. The 111-d LC 50 for the stonefly
_Acroneria pacifica_ was 5.8 mg·L [-1], and the 90-d LC 30 for
the fly _Atherix variegata_ was 1.7 mg·L [-1] (Gaufin 1973).
Winter et al _._ (1996) found that for the mayfly _Hexagenia_
_limbata_, the LOEC was 2.44 mg·L [-1] DO. They also noted
that the mean growth (based on head width) decreased
from 5.58 to 2.44% when the DO decreased from 8.9 to
2.44 mg·L [-1] .

As part of the Northern River Basins Study, Lowell and
Culp (1996) found that at DO levels of 5 mg·L [-1],
approximately 20% of mayfly larvae _(Baetis tricaudata)_
moved from the bottom of the tanks to areas of increased

current velocity, which may in turn have led to an increase
in their predation. The authors also found a significant
reduction in survival after 14 d, and noted that the
mayflies were near the emergence life stage.

The effects of low DO levels in the presence of other
stressors may also result in some adverse effects.
Combined hypoxia and hypercapnia (high CO 2 levels)
result in respiratory acidosis. Hyperventilation in this
situation will not result in an increase in affinity of blood
for DO (Jensen et al _._ 1993). Hydrogen sulfide liberates
oxygen from oxygenated hemoglobin and forms
sulfhemoglobin. More importantly, H 2 S inhibits
cytochrome(c) oxidase in mitochondria of tissue cells,
which blocks the last step in the respiratory chain where
oxygen is the final electron acceptor (Jensen et al _._ 1993).
Some metals interfere with respiration. Zinc and nickel
reduce the diffusing capacity of the gills, resulting in a fall
of oxygen supply to fish tissue (Hughes 1981). Nickel also
increases the diffusion distance. Ventilatory frequency and
amplitude increased during hypoxia following zinc
treatment. An increase in H [+] and aluminum obstruct gill
function through the precipitation of aluminum on the gill
surface. Mucus production also increased and gill
lamellae fused and thickened (McDonald and Wood 1993,

as referenced in Jensen et al. 1993). The toxicity of zinc,
lead, copper, and phenols to rainbow trout increased at
lower DO concentrations (Lloyd and Herbert 1962).

During the winter months, DO concentrations in water
systems are reduced by ice cover, which decreases reaeration, influxes of oxygen-depleted groundwater, and
oxidation of organic material (Chambers 1996). It is
important during winter, therefore, to ensure that no
additional anthropogenic oxygen-depleting sources are
discharged into these systems. For information concerning
DO considerations during the winter months, see the
Northern River Basins Study (Chambers 1996).

The Canadian water quality guidelines for the lowest
acceptable DO concentrations are 6 and 5.5 mg·L [-1] for the
early and other life stages, respectively, in warm-water
ecosystems, and 9.5 and 6.5 mg·L [-1] for the early and other
life stages, respectively, in cold-water ecosystems. The
guidelines were derived from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency’s “slight production impairment”
estimates (USEPA 1986), with an additional safety
margin of 0.5 mg·L [-1] to estimate threshold DO
concentrations.

Since intragravel DO concentrations are reduced due to
sediment oxygen demand and respirating fish embryos,
the water quality guideline value of 6.5 mg·L [-1] should
apply to conditions in the redds (gravel beds). CCREM
(1987) adopted a differential of 3 mg·L [-1] between the
overlying water and the interstitial water to arrive at the
guideline for the early life stage in cold-water ecosystems.
This guideline was established to protect salmonid larvae
in these redds. Survival during the emergence life stage of
_Leptophlebia_ and _Ephemera_ invertebrates is decreased at
DO concentrations < 8.3 mg·L [-1] (Nebeker 1972), and
occurs from mid-May to the end of June (Leonard and
Leonard 1962; Edmunds et al. 1976; Clifford et al. 1979).
Survival during this stage is also decreased at DO levels
<5 mg·L [-1] for _Baetis_ (Lowell and Culp 1996). Therefore,
the early life stage guideline should be applied at those
times and places where salmonid spawning and
invertebrate emergence are known, or are likely, to occur.

During winter, lack of re-aeration can cause significant
depletion of DO under natural conditions; during summer,
the presence of aquatic macrophytes or benthic algae can
result in significant oxygen fluctuations. Therefore, where
natural conditions alone create DO concentrations <110%

of the guideline, the minimum acceptable concentration is
90% of the natural concentrations.
