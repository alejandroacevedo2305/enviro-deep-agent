**Cat** **[®]** **Skid Steer Loaders lead the industry in operator**

**comfort, performance and versatility. Inside the spacious**

**operator station, feel the superior comfort of a sealed and**

**pressurized cab. Adjustable seat mounted controls and an**

**available air ride seat keep you comfortable throughout**

**the work day. Increased rated operating capacities,**

**higher horsepower and improved drawbar performance**

**help you get more done and increase your bottom line.**

### Operator Station

Superior comfort to keep you productive throughout the work day.

**Superior Comfort**
Comfort and ease of operation have been designed into every
aspect of the operator station. The wide, spacious interior and
uncluttered floor provide a comfortable work environment with
excellent head, shoulder and leg room to keep productivity high
and help reduce fatigue.

**Sealed and Pressurized Cab**

Operators spend long hours in the machine. The optional sealed
and pressurized cab keeps dust out and clean air in for greater
operator comfort. Reduced sound levels within the cab also
help reduce fatigue.

**Seat Mounted Joystick Controls**
Ergonomic, seat mounted joystick controls enable a wide range
of comfortable operating positions for operators of any size.
The seat and controls are independently adjustable to meet
the specific needs of the operator.

**Advanced Machine Information and Control System**
The optional Advanced Machine Information and Control System
(AMICS) provides easy to read analog gauges for hydraulic oil
and engine coolant temperature. The electronic display provides
additional operating information such as engine speed, job clock
and diagnostic service codes. This display also provides the user
interface for the optional AccuGradeTM Grade Control System.
The Selectable Work Speed Control, Selectable Implement
Control and Selectable Hystat Response Control modes allow
the operator to “dial in” his machine to maximize production.

**Additional Features for Maximum Comfort**

- Air ride seat available for an unparalleled level of comfort

in a skid steer loader.

- Easy to read instrument panels.

- Optional air conditioner and heater for greater comfort

in extreme conditions.

- Optional Selectable Pattern Control which allows the operator
to select the control pattern they are most familiar with for
greater productivity.

3

### Power Train

Aggressive performance with fuel efficiency.

**Cat Engine**
The high performance power train provides high engine horsepower and torque.
The machines feature the Cat C3.4 DIT engine - a rugged, reliable engine that
meets U.S. EPA Tier 4 Interim/EU Stage IIIA emission requirements.

**Hand and Foot Throttles**

Hand and foot throttles allow the operator to match engine speed to the task.
The hand throttle is ideal for jobs requiring constant engine speed such as cold
planing, trenching or snow blowing. The foot throttle lets the operator vary engine
speed and minimize fuel consumption for other tasks such as load and carry, truck
loading, grading and dozing.

**Electronic Torque Management**
The Electronic Torque Management system maximizes power to the ground
and prevents the engine from stalling in tough digging and dozing applications for
maximum productivity. The system allows part throttle operation which provides
smoother machine operation and reduces fuel consumption.

**Selectable Work Speed Control**
The optional Selectable Work Speed Control lets you select the ground speed
that is best suited for the application. This feature is useful in operations such as
trenching and cold planing that require precise machine control at relatively slow
and constant speeds.

**Selectable Hystat Response Control**
The optional Selectable Hystat Response Control lets the operator select one of
three modes to match the machine’s drive response to the operator’s preference,
skill level and application requirements.

### Lift

**Linkages**
Built for tough working
conditions.

**Choice of Lift Designs**
Two types of lifting arrangements are
available - vertical lift (path #1 above)
and radial lift (path #2) - to meet your
specific application needs.

**Vertical Lift**

The 262C Series 2 features the vertical

lift design which provides extended reach
and lift height for quick and easy truck
loading and material placement. The lift
height is 3233 mm (127 in) on the

262C Series 2.

**Radial Lift**

The 246C, with its radial lift design,
delivers excellent digging performance
and superior mid-lift reach.

### Hydraulics

Exceptional lift, breakout and power to meet your needs.

**High Performance Hydraulic System**
Maximum power and reliability are built into the Cat Skid Steer
Loader hydraulic system. In addition to providing power to the
wheels, this system also powers the loader lift and tilt functions,
powers the auxiliary circuit to drive work tools and drives the
engine cooling fan. The hydraulic system features:

 - Increased lift and tilt breakout forces allowing you to move
more material and get more done.

 - Continuous demand fan for improved fuel efficiency, increased
horsepower, reduced sound levels and improved cold weather
performance.

 - Cat ToughGuardTM hoses for increased reliability and durability.

 - High capacity hydraulic tank and side-by-side cooling package
keep components cool for maximum durability.

**Two Speed Option**
Two speed is available as an option to increase cycle times
and get the job done faster.

**High Flow XPS**
High flow XPS hydraulic system is
available on all models for greater machine
versatility. Maximum performance can
be maintained regardless of the work tool
speed or conditions with this load sensing,
pressure compensating system. Cat cooling
systems are sized to allow the operator to
continuously power high flow work tools
in conditions that cause competitive

machines to overheat.

**Selectable Implement Control**
The Selectable Implement Control
option with three levels of control
gives the operator the ability to adjust
the responsiveness and speed of the lift
and tilt functions for more precise
implement control.

**Speed Sensitive Ride Control**
The optional Speed Sensitive Ride
Control system delivers a smoother ride
on uneven terrain for superior comfort.
It allows for both higher speed operation

and better material retention for increased

productivity. The system automatically
turns off when digging or placing a load
for maximum performance and control.

durability, Cat Work Tools deliver high productivity
in a variety of applications to maximize versatility:

 - Augers

 - Backhoes

 - Blades (angle, dozer)

 - Buckets (general purpose, high capacity, dirt,
utility, light material, multi purpose, industrial
grapple, utility grapple)

 - Brooms (angle, pickup, utility)

 - Brushcutters

 - Cold Planers

 - Forks (pallet, industrial grapple, utility
grapple, utility)

 - Landscape Tillers

 - Landscape Rakes

 - Material Handling Arm

 - Mulchers

 - Power Box Rakes

 - Shear

 - Snow Blowers

 - Stump Grinders

 - Trenchers

**Quick Couplers**
Work tools can be changed quickly and easily
with the Cat Skid Steer Loader’s quick coupler
system. The standard quick coupler features manual
engagement and disengagement of work tools using
two high leverage handles. The optional hydraulic
quick coupler allows the operator to quickly change
tools without leaving the cab.

**AccuGradeTM Grade Control System for Skid**
**Steer, Multi Terrain and Compact Track Loaders**
Common to AccuGrade systems for Track-Type
Tractors and Motor Graders, this deeply integrated
solution automates the machine’s electrohydraulic
controls to achieve a consistent grade across the
work site, improve accuracy and increase productivity,
ultimately lowering operating and material costs.

6

### Serviceability

Simplified service and maintenance save you time and money.

**Easy Service**
Convenient service features make maintenance easy, reducing
your downtime:

 - Rear door opens 90 degrees for easy access to both sides
of the engine.

 - Cooling package tilts up to provide excellent access to the
engine compartment.

 - Cab tilts rearward for easy access to all hydraulic pumps,
motors, valves, lines and hydraulic tank.

 - Daily maintenance points are easily accessible.

 - Wires are color coded and numbered for easy identification.

### • S [•] O [•] S [SM] oil sampling valves are standard to allow regular

monitoring of the engine and hydraulic oil quality.

### Customer Support

Unmatched support makes
the difference.

**Superior Dealer Service**
