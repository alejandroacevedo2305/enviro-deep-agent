_These regulations were cancelled in September ,_
_following the inclusion of the BREFs in the NeR._

**D3** **Iron and steel foundries**
**and smelting plants**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

**Foundries**

_Particulates_

The general standards of the NeR apply to particulate
emissions.

_Amines_

The waste gases which are produced in core
fabrication, core-sand mixing, recycling, drying and
hardening must be collected as much as possible or be
exhausted at the source, and then submitted to
treatment by cleaning equipment.

The emission concentration of amines may not exceed
. mg/m  .

**Smelting furnaces**

_Dioxins_

Feedstocks for the smelting furnaces must contain the
least possible content in chlorine compounds in order
to prevent the formation of dioxins.

_Particulates_

New smelting furnaces and newly installed dust
separation devices must comply with the general
standards for particulates.*

- The feasibility of this standard is still the subject of
consultations and research.

**E1** **Coking plants**

_These regulations were cancelled in September ,_
_following the inclusion of the BREFs in the NeR._

**E2** **Production of chlorine**

_These regulations were cancelled in September ,_
_following the inclusion of the BREFs in the NeR._

**E3** **PVC-production,**
**suspension polymerisation**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Vinyl chloride_
The emission of vinyl chloride must be kept as low as
possible.
Before the reactor may be opened it must be flushed at
least twice (for example with nitrogen), and the
flushing gases must be redirected to a suitable recovery
plant for vinyl chloride.

The gases and vapours from the water stripper must be
discharged to a recovery plant or to a boiler or a
dedicated incineration device.

In the case of a mass flow per source below the limit
mass flow of g/h a daily average emission
concentration level of  mg/m  applies if an active
carbon filter is used.

Where incineration is practised, the general standard
applies.

The  powder, on leaving the afterdrier, may not
contain vinyl chloride levels in excess of . mg/kg.

The emission of vinyl chloride from the siphon shaped
water locks of the gas holders should be kept to
minimum possible levels.

As per July 2000 there are legal requirements in place for

the production of PVC using the suspension polymerisation

process ( _Staatscourant_ 2000, no. 136).

**E4** **Production of acrylonitrile**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply_

_Acrylonitrile_
The waste gases from the reactor and absorber must be
fed into an incinerator.

The emission concentration of acrylonitrile in the
waste gas from the incinerator may not exceed .
mg/m  . This is the detection limit indicated for very
good analysis techniques.
The emissions released in the distillation of the

reaction products and the emissions released due to
displacement losses in the case of storage of
(intermediate) products must comply with the general
requirements of the NeR.

**E5** **Manufacture of plastics**
**containing acrylonitrile**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Acrylonitrile_
All waste gas flows with a concentration of acrylonitrile
of more than . mg/m  must be fed into a waste gas
treatment plant.

If concentrated waste gas flows from the
polymerisation process are fed into a special incinerator
a requirement applies of . mg/m  acrylonitrile, or a
combustion efficiency of at least %.

For the removal of acrylonitrile from waste gases in
highly dilute flows, such as the waste gases from the
dryers, preference should be given to techniques other
than incineration.

If incinerators are utilised the general requirements of
the NeR apply, and a combustion efficiency of at least
.% is required.

**E6** **Claus plants (used in**
**sulphur production and**
**as a flue gas treatment**
**system)**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Oxides of sulphur_
New installations

a. New installations for the production of sulphur
using the Claus process, or modifications thereof,
must have been designed for a conversion efficiency
of .%. They must be operated in line with design
criteria as far as possible.
b. If the original rated    processing capacity of the
total facility is increased by more than %, then the
total amount of    fed into the installation
(including existing installations) must be processed
with a conversion efficiency of .%. If the total of
multiple subsequent extensions exceeds % of the
original rated capacity, the above criteria also apply.

Existing Installations
The total emissions from existing installations in a
facility must have been reduced by at least % before
 January . This stipulation only applies where an
average conversion efficiency of % for the total
processing of    in the facility is not obtained.

Small plants
For installations with a sulphur production output of
less than . tonnes per day the rule applies that the
emission of sulphur compounds is allowed to amount
to a maximum of % of the production output.

_Hydrogen sulphide_
For all installations the standard applies that the
emission concentration of hydrogen sulphide may not
exceed  mg/m  .

For new and existing installations a commitment is
required to comply in due time with the general
requirements of the NeR.

**E7** **Production of nitrogen-**
**based fertiliser**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Ammonia_

The concentrations of gaseous ammonia released in the
production of nitrate-containing fertilisers in the case
of new installations may not exceed  mg/m  . This
requirement does not apply to the waste gases from
urea granulation.

For existing installations the status quo must be
maintained, that is to say that, depending on the
present emission level, a requirement of between 
and  mg/m  continues to apply.

_Particulates_

Particulate emissions from granulators and prilling
towers are in principle subject to the general particulate
standard, except that the fineness and hygroscopic
nature of ammonium nitrate and urea mists limit the

optimum separation yield of filtering separators, which
may impose the need to depart from the general
concentration standards on duly stated grounds.

**E8** **Ammonia plants**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Ammonia_

The concentrations of ammonia in the waste gases of
point sources in ammonia plants may not exceed
 mg/m  .

**E9** **Installations for the**
**production, formulation**
**or packaging of pesticides**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Particulates_

In the waste gases of installations for the production of
‘active substances’ as referred to in the Pesticides Act

( _Bestrijdingsmiddelenwet_ ), the particulate content,
including the active components, in the case of a mass
flow of  g/hour and more may not exceed a
concentration of . mg/m  .
In installations for the packaging and formulation of
pesticides, extracted air containing particulates must be
subjected to cleaning in a dust removal plant; the
concentration of particulate emissions may not exceed
. mg/m  .

**E10** **Production of silicon**

**carbide**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Oxides of sulphur_
The production facilities must be provided with covers
in such a way that the fumes produced during the
production of silicon carbide are collected and fed into
an incinerator after first having been passed through a
de-sulphurisation plant. The aim should be to achieve
the lowest possible sulphur content in the petroleum
coke used.

_Particulates_

During the assembly and disassembly of the
production facilities they must be sprayed with water
in order to prevent the emission of particulates.

_NH_ __ _,_ _H_ __ _S_ _, odours_
Drainage water containing ammonia and hydrogen
sulphide must be collected and purified in a water
treatment plant.

**E11** **Installations for natural**
**gas and petroleum**
**extraction**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in January ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

These special regulations target extraction facilities for
natural gas and petroleum and the associated processes
for treating them. Installations exclusively intended for
de-sulphurisation of (acid) gas containing a high
percentage of hydrogen sulphide are not subject to the
provisions of these regulations because the process used
is very different. Refer, for instance, to E for more
details.

**Definition of the term ‘installations’**

The regulation applies to installations as referred to in Article

8.2, paragraph 3 of the Environmental Protection Act ( _Wet_

_Milieubeheer_ ), (Article 9 paragraph 1, item 4 of the Mining

Act ( _Mijnwet_ ) of 4 February 1994; _Staatsblad_ 135) as well

as equivalent installations covered by the Mining Act for

Operations on the Continental Shelf ( _Mijnwet Continentaal_

_Plat_ ), dated 4 February 1994, Staatsblad 135).

The following provisions apply in the case of new
installations. Existing installations must have a
comparable level of abatement facilities in place before
 January  (taking into account the cost
effectiveness of the adaptations required) unless the
installations involved cease to be operational after
 January . Especially in the case of off-shore
installations, the restrictions that apply in the interest
of safety, weight and available space must be taken into
account when emission abatement facilities are being
prescribed.
Installations incorporating flares are not customary in
the case of gas extraction platforms at sea: these are
usually replaced by venting systems.
Furthermore, emission reductions achieved by
punctual scheduled maintenance can be a problem,
especially in the case of unmanned installations due to
the lower frequency of inspections. That is why in
these cases low emission or maintenance free systems
must be preferred.

**New and existing installations**

For the definitions of new and existing installations please

refer to the descriptions given in the Declaration of intent

entitled ‘ _Uitvoering milieubeleid olie en_

_gaswinningsindustrie_ ’ (Implementation of environmental

policies in the oil and gas extraction industries).

**Volatile organic substances**

**Definition of VOC**

Volatile organic substances in this context also includes

methane. In determining the level of abatement facilities

required in the present regulations the presence of benzene

in natural gas has been taken into consideration.

_Off-shore installations (gas and oil)_
Newly erected extraction facilities must be equipped
with an efficient system to control the key emissions of
volatile components from the condensate.
The preferred measure is to transport the condensate
off the facility under pressure, allowing the
(provisional) de-gassing and final stabilising to be
carried out as much as possible at a central location,
the waste gases of which can subsequently be required
to be treated as in the case of land-based installations.

Depending on the situation, such measures will need
to be implemented in phases. Furthermore, vented
gases must be used wherever possible as a fuel for
engines, turbines or furnaces.

_Land-based installations (gas and oil)_
The destruction efficiencies of flares indicated below
must be interpreted as rated efficiencies that apply
under standard conditions. The use of purging gases
must be limited as much as possible by employing
adequate technical measures. Purging with inert gas is
usually incompatible with the minimum combustion
efficiencies required. Injection with steam as a
technical measure is not yet considered as Best
Available Technique within the context of the
installations affected by the present regulations.
The measures to be taken are dependent on the nature
and the process conditions (in particular the pressures)
of the waste gases being released. The following sources
and conditions are recognised:

_Waste gas flows of medium pressure (> _ _kPa)_
Waste gas flows of medium pressure released during
normal operation must, where this can be done effectively,
be re-compressed and injected into the main stream of the
gas being produced or, alternatively, be utilised as a fuel. If
it is not economically feasible to utilise them, the waste
gas flows concerned must be discharged via a medium
pressure (safety) flare. This flare must be designed to have
an efficiency of % minimum.
It concerns the following sources:

- stabilisation of condensate (first step);

- glycol flash gas.

_Low pressure waste gas flows (< _ _kPa)_
Continuously and semi-continuously released waste
gas flows must be put to practical use wherever
possible, or, if this is not possible, be discharged to a
(separate low-pressure) flare which is designed with a
view to burn the waste gases with a minimum
efficiency of %.
This applies in particular to the following sources:

- non-condensable vapours from the glycol
regeneration process;

- storage tanks for condensates, breathing losses;

- blanketing gas used in storage tanks (condensate etc.);

- stabilisation of condensates ();
Insofar as they are isolated from the environment and
can be treated as point sources:

- waste gases emitted from cartridge-type seals in
compressors and gases vented from the crankcases of

compressors;

- emissions resulting from the loading and unloading
of condensates.

**Flares**

An alternative for burning the waste gases in a separate

flare is to feed them to the burners of the glycol regeneration

furnace, provided that optimal combustion is permanently

guaranteed and the adjustment range of the furnace allows

this option. Provided that a high destruction efficiency can

be guaranteed, these low pressure flows may also be burnt

in the (medium pressure) safety flare mentioned earlier.

Waste gases from sources of organic substances not
specifically mentioned here with an estimated average
waste gas flow in excess of  to  m [] /h must also be
treated in the manner described above. Low pressure
waste gas flows containing hydrocarbons - including
the above-mentioned flows - with a smaller mass flow,
can be exempted from measures being taken. These
include:

- breathers of water tanks.

The use of natural gas as a priming gas for turbines and
gas engines results in short-lasting, very high emissions.
Feeding such flows to a flare creates problems because
the existing flare capacity cannot cope with them.
Methods must be devised in order to eliminate the use

of natural gas as a priming gas or, alternatively, to
reduce it.

_Fugitive emissions_
The selection of certain types of valves, flanges and
other fittings must be done with minimum leakage in
mind. In order to control fugitive emissions a schedule
must be drawn up arranging high profile inspection
and maintenance of pumps, compressors, valves, safety
valves and other fittings. As a part of these
arrangements the leakage from the types of fittings
mentioned above in particular must be measured at
least once a year. Flanges, vents, drains (provided that
they are fitted with a plug) and sampling points need
not be measured every year. Any leakages that are
noticed must be remedied immediately. Leakages in
this context mean emission concentrations in excess of

, ppm by volume of all hydrocarbons taken
together and/or in excess of  ppm by volume in the
case of benzene. If repairs are not possible while the
installation is in operation they must be carried out at
the latest the next time the installation is stopped for

maintenance.

_Incidental emissions resulting from starting up, shutting_
_down and emergency stop procedures_
The general requirements are not applicable to
situations that occur on an incidental basis.

Incidentally released gas flows must be discharged to an
appropriate emergency facility.
Activities of an incidental nature include:

- start-up of the gas purification process;

- testing of the emergency facilities for venting gas;

- emergency stops;

- in the case of planned stops, depressurising (part of)
the equipment;

- maintenance to wells.

In assessing whether it is necessary or desirable from an
environmental protection point of view to opt for a
flare as safety system, the continuous emission of flarebased installations will need to be weighed against the
uncontrolled emissions which can occur during
incidental process conditions. On the basis of a safety
and environment targeted evaluation for the individual
location the considerations of §.. may be overruled.

_Well drilling activities_
Wherever possible the gases which are released during
the testing of a new well must be collected and put to
some practical use. If this is not possible, the waste
gases must be burnt with the aid of a (temporary) flare.
The gases which are released during the final (post-)
production stages of a well must be burnt using a flare
wherever possible.

**NO** **x**
_On- and off-shore_
For furnaces, gas engines and gas turbines for which
explicit rules are given in the Decree on emission
standards for combustion plants (Besluit emissie-eisen
stookinstallaties, ) but which are officially not
covered by the Decree, emission requirements may be
drawn up which are based on the Decree. In laying
down the standards to be met the non-standard

composition of certain flows that may be present in the
mix being burnt must be taken into consideration.

**Requirements as compared to BEES**

Due to the comparability of the processes and the options

for reducing emissions that are available the same

requirements can be made applicable as in BEES. Prompted

by the amendment of BEES A and BEES B in 1998, the

necessity of adjusting the present regulation will be duly

considered.

_Furnaces_

The emissions from gas fired furnaces for regenerating
glycol may not exceed  mg/m   x in the case of
new and existing installations.
The emission values quoted are based on a (reference)
oxygen content of %.

The waste gases employed generally deviate in terms of
their caloric value from standard natural gas. The
correction factor for the emission concentration to be

used because of this is the ratio between the lowest

encountered caloric value of the used gas (in /kg)
and the caloric value of natural gas, which has been
standardised at /kg.

_Gas engines_
The emissions from gas engines may not exceed:

-  g  x per  in the case of existing engines;

-  g  x per  in the case of new engines.
In both cases the values must be multiplied by / of
the engine efficiency.

**NO** **x** **requirement for existing gas engines**

The feasibility of this standard is still the subject of

consultations and research. The potential technologies

being considered are either adapting the air to fuel ratio in

combination with engine management systems in the case of

lean burning engines or the use of exhaust fitted catalytic

converters in the case of rich mixture engines.

_Gas turbines_

The emissions from gas turbines may not exceed:

-  g  x per  in the case of existing turbines;

-  g  x per  in the case of new turbines;
In both cases the values must be multiplied by a factor
of / of the turbine efficiency.

The waste gases employed generally deviate in terms of
their caloric value from standard natural gas. The
correction factor for the emission concentration to be

used because of this is the ratio between the lowest

encountered caloric value of the used gas (in /kg)
and the caloric value of natural gas, which has been
standardised at /kg. This factor may not be greater
than . and not smaller than ..

**NO** **x** **requirement for new gas turbines**

In the case of new turbines lower emission requirementseven as low as 65 g/GJ - may be made compulsory due to

the levels guaranteed for modern gas turbines employing

dry-low NO x technologies. For these installations, steam

injection is not considered Best Available Technique.

**SO** **2** **, H** **2** **S**
In the case of fields producing natural gas with a
relatively high concentration of hydrogen sulphide and
other compounds, demands must be formulated for
  and    on the basis of further testing under actual
conditions.

_Mandatory inspections_
The above-mentioned sources must be monitored in

accordance with the provisions of §.. This having
been said, additionally the rule applies that taking
measurements may be decided against if on the basis of
properties typical for the equipment, or, alternatively,
based on certified measurements, it is possible to
reliably determine the emissions that will occur under
normal operating conditions.

_Fugitive emissions_
Pumps, compressors and safety equipment and valves
must be inspected annually in accordance with 
method . The requirement of semi-annual testing of
all valves for leakage may be relaxed to comprise an
annual random sample of % of those valves if, on the
basis of measurements, it can be demonstrated that less
than % of all valves leak an emission concentration of
, ppm per volume of all hydrocarbons taken
together or, where applicable, less than % of all valves
leak an emission concentration of  ppm per volume
of benzene.

_Furnaces, gas engines, turbines_
For the methods of taking measurements, the
frequency of inspections and the interpretation of
measurement results, as well as for the manner in
which these results must be reported, please refer to the
sections concerned in  and .

**F1** **Installations for the**

**thermal reclamation of**

**metals from cables and**
**corresponding utilities**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

In cases where the installations concerned are beyond
the scope of the Decree on air emissions from waste
incineration (Besluit luchtemissies afvalverbranding,
 [][)], nevertheless the emission requirements laid
down in that document are applicable, except that:

- the emission standards are based on an oxygen
content of % by volume;

- the incinerators must be equipped with an efficient
afterburner;

- the temperature maintained in the afterburning area
must be at least °C and this temperature must be
maintained until the end of the operating period;.

- the temperature maintained in the afterburner must
be at least °C if the items to be processed
contain  mg/kg or more of halogenated aromatic
hydrocarbons;

- independently of the combustion temperatures
indicated above, the fumes must remain in the
afterburning area for a sufficiently long time (at least
 s) and a minimum oxygen availability of % must
be maintained;

- the metal-recovery process may only be started if the
required incineration temperature has been reached;

- residues may not continue to give off fumes after
leaving the installation;

- the installations must be equipped with
measurement devices which continuously monitor
the mass concentrations of particulates and carbon
monoxide in the waste gases, and the afterburning
temperature; installations in which chlorinated
components are incinerated must be equipped with
measurement devices which continuously record the
concentration by mass of gaseous inorganic chlorine
compounds.

waste incineration (Besluit luchtemissies afvalverbranding, )
refer to the explanatory note in Special Regulation A.
