# _Model ESFR-25_ _Early Suppression, Fast Response Pendent Sprinklers_ _25.2 K-factor_

# _General_ _Description_

The TYCO Model ESFR-25 Pendent
Sprinklers are Early Suppression, Fast
Response Sprinklers” having a nomi­
nal K-factor of 25.2. (Refer to Figure
1.) They are suppression-mode sprin­
klers that are especially advantageous
as a means of eliminating the use of
in-rack sprinklers when protecting
high-piled storage.

The Model ESFR-25 Sprinklers are
primarily used for ceiling-only sprin­
kler protection of (but not limited to)
the following storage applications:

 - Most encapsulated or non-encap­

sulated common materials including
cartoned, unexpanded plastics.

 - Uncartoned (exposed) expanded

plastics in accordance with NFPA
13 and FM Global standards.

 - Some storage arrangements of

rubber tires, roll paper, flammable
liquids, aerosols, and automotive
components.

For more specific criteria, refer to
Table 1 as well as the applicable de­
sign standard.

The Model ESFR-25 Pendent
Sprinklers provide the system
designer with hydraulic and sprinkler
placement options not presently
available to the traditional ESFR
sprinklers having nominal K-factors of
14.0 and 16.8. In particular, the Model
ESFR-25 Sprinkler has been designed
to operate at substantially lowerend head pressures, as compared

_**IMPORTANT**_
_Always refer to Technical Data_
_Sheet TFP700 for the “INSTALLER_
_WARNING” that provides cau­_
_tions with respect to handling_
_and installation of sprinkler sys­_
_tems and components. Improp­_
_er handling and installation can_
_permanently_ _damage_ _a_ _sprin­_
_kler system or its components_
_and cause the sprinkler to fail_
_to operate in a fire situation or cause_
_it to operate prematurely._

to ESFR Sprinklers having nominal
K-factors of 14.0 and 16.8. This feature
offers flexibility when sizing system
piping, as well as possibly reducing or
eliminating the need for a system fire
pump.

Also, Model ESFR-25 Sprinklers per­
mit use of a maximum deflector-toceiling distance of 18 inches (460 mm)
versus 14 inches (356 mm). Addition­
ally, a storage arrangement of 40 ft.
(12,2 m) with a ceiling height of 45 ft.
(13,7 m) does not require in-rack sprin­
klers as do other ESFR Sprinklers hav­
ing nominal K-factors of 14.0 and 16.8.

The Model ESFR-25 Sprinklers are
listed by Underwriters Laboratories
(UL) for specific applications with a
maximum storage height of 43 ft. (13,1
m) with a maximum ceiling height of
48 ft. (14,6 m) without the requirement
for in-rack sprinklers. Refer to the
Specific Application Listing (UL) for
the design criteria.

Applications for the TYCO ESFR
Sprinklers are expanding beyond cur­
rently recognized installation stan­
dards. For information on research fire
tests (e.g., with flammable liquids and
aerosols) that may be acceptable to an
authority having jurisdiction, contact
the Technical Services department.

~~_**NOTICE**_~~

_The Model ESFR-25 Sprinklers described_
_herein must be installed and maintained_
_in compliance with this document, as_
_well as with the applicable standards of_
_the National Fire Protection Association,_
_in addition to the standards of any_
_authorities having jurisdiction (e.g., FM_
_Global). Failure to do so may impair the_
_performance of these devices._

_The owner is responsible for maintaining_
_their fire protection system and devices in_
_proper operating condition. The installing_
_contractor or sprinkler manufacturer_
_should be contacted with any questions._

_In all cases, the appropriate NFPA or FM_
_installation standard, or other applicable_
_standard, must be referenced to ensure_
_applicability and to obtain complete_
_installation guidelines. The general_
_guidelines in this data sheet are not_
_intended to provide complete installation_
_criteria._

# _Design_ _Criteria_

The following general guidelines pro­
vided for the TYCO Model ESFR-25
Pendent Sprinklers can be used for a
quick reference.

The National Fire Protection Associa­
tion (NFPA) and FM Global (FM) pro­
vide installation standards that must
be used to properly design an auto­
matic sprinkler system utilizing Early
Suppression, Fast Response (ESFR)
Sprinklers. The guidelines provided
by NFPA and FM may differ. Con­
sequently, the appropriate standard
must be used for a given installation.

In all cases, the appropriate NFPA or
FM installation standard must be ref­
erenced to ensure applicability and

to obtain complete installation guide­
lines. The following general guidelines
are not intended to provide complete
installation criteria.

In addition to this data sheet, the fol­
lowing data sheets describe other
TYCO ESFR Sprinklers:

# _Operation_

The fusible link assembly is comprised
of two link halves that are joined to­
gether by a thin layer of solder. When
the rated temperature is reached, the
solder melts and the two link halves
separate, activating the sprinkler and
flowing water.

**TFP312**
**Page 4 of 4**

# _Installation_

The TYCO Model ESFR-25 Pendent
Sprinklers must be installed in accor­
dance with this section.

**General Instructions**
Damage to the fusible Link Assembly
during installation can be avoided by
handling the sprinkler by the frame
arms only (that is, do not apply pres­
sure to the fusible Link Assembly),
and by using the appropriate sprinkler
wrench. Failure to do so can lead to an
unstable link assembly and premature
activation of the sprinkler. Damaged
sprinklers must be replaced.

A leak-tight 1 inch NPT sprinkler joint
should be obtained by applying a min­
imum-to-maximum torque of 20 to 30
ft./lbs. (26,8 to 40,2 Nm). Higher levels
of torque can distort the sprinkler inlet
with consequent leakage or impair­
ment of the sprinkler.

**Step 1.** Install the Model ESFR-25
Pendent Sprinkler in the pendent po­
sition (Figure 2).

**Step 2.** With pipe-thread sealant ap­
plied, hand-tighten the sprinkler into
the sprinkler fitting. Do not apply pres­
sure to the Link Assembly, and handle
the Model ESFR-25 Pendent Sprinkler
only by the Frame arms.

**Step 3.** Wrench-tighten the Model
ESFR-25 Pendent Sprinkler using only
the W-Type 1 Sprinkler Wrench (Figure
2) and by fully engaging (seating) the
wrench on the sprinkler wrench flats
(Figure 1).

**Step 4.** After installation, inspect the
Link Assembly of each Model ESFR25 Pendent Sprinkler for damage. In
particular, verify that the Link Assem­
bly and Hook are positioned as illus­
trated in Figure 1, and that the Link
Assembly is not bent, creased, or
forced out of normal position in any
way. Replace damaged sprinklers.

# _Care and_ _Maintenance_

The TYCO Model ESFR-25 Pendent
Sprinklers must be maintained and
serviced in accordance with this
section.

Before closing a fire protection system
main control valve for maintenance
work on the fire protection system that
it controls, permission to shut down
the affected fire protection system
must be obtained from the proper au­
thorities and notify all personnel who
may be affected by this action.

Sprinklers which are found to be leak­
ing or exhibiting visible signs of corro­
sion must be replaced.

Automatic sprinklers must never be
painted, plated, coated, or other­
wise altered after leaving the factory.
Modified sprinklers must be replaced.
Sprinklers that have been exposed to
corrosive products of combustion, but
have not operated, should be replaced
if they cannot be completely cleaned
by wiping the sprinkler with a cloth or
by brushing it with a soft bristle brush.

Care must be exercised to avoid dam­
age to the sprinklers - before, during,
and after installation. Sprinklers dam­
aged by dropping, striking, wrench
twist/slippage, or the like, must be
replaced. Also, replace any sprinkler
that has a cracked bulb or that has
lost liquid from its bulb. (Ref. Installa­
tion Section.)

The owner is responsible for the in­
spection, testing, and maintenance of
their fire protection system and devic­
es in compliance with this document,
as well as with the applicable stan­
dards of the National Fire Protection
Association (e.g., NFPA 25), in addi­
tion to the standards of any authorities
having jurisdiction. Contact the install­
ing contractor or sprinkler manufac­
turer regarding any questions.

Automatic sprinkler systems are
recommended to be inspected,
tested, and maintained by a qualified
Inspection Service in accordance with
local requirements and/or national
codes.
