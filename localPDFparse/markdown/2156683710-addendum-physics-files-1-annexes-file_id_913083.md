### Stable.

# Novatracker

### Reliable. Adaptable.

#### The new Nengyao Novatracker sets the standard for stability. With a self-locking actuator at each foundation and low-tilt stowing, Novatracker is stable at 50+ m/s while using less steel than fixed tilt. Novatracker’s maintenance-free actuators are synchronized by a driveshaft, connecting up to 95kW with a single motor and controller. The flexible architecture allows maximum coverage of complex sites, while keeping complexity and cost low.
