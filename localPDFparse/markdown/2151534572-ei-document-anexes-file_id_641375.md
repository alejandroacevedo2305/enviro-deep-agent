###### DuraTrack ® HZ v3

HZ v3 --
Three decades of fi eld-tested design improvements have resulted in the DuraTrack [®]

the most durable, reliable tracking system under the sun. While our single-bolt module clamp and

forgiving tolerances streamline installation, and our fl exibly linked architecture maximizes power

density, it’s our innovative use of fewer components and a failure-free wind management system

that makes Array Technologies the best choice for solar trackers. Better. Stronger. Smarter.

HIGHEST POWER
DENSITY.
Higher density means
more power and more
profi t. DuraTrack HZ v3
off ers the unique ability
to maximize the power
density of each site,
boasting 100 modules
per row and higher
density than our closest
competition.

LEADING TERRAIN
ADAPTABILITY.
Our fl exibly linked
architecture, with
articulating driveline joints
and forgiving tolerances,
creates the most adaptable
system on the market for
following natural land
contours while creating
the greatest power
generation potential
from every site.

FEWER
COMPONENTS.
GREATER
RELIABILITY.
Array was founded on a
philosophy of engineered
simplicity. Minimizing
potential failure points
(167 times fewer
components than
competitors), DuraTrack
HZ v3 consistently
delivers higher reliability
and superior uptime.

FAILURE-FREE
WIND DESIGN.

DuraTrack HZ v3 was
designed and fi eld tested
to withstand some of the

harshest conditions on the
planet. It is the only tracker
on the market that reliably
handles wind events with
a fully integrated, fully
mechanical, passive
wind-load mitigation
system without the need
for complex communication
systems, batteries, or power.

ZERO SCHEDULED
MAINTENANCE.

Maintenance-free motors
and gears, fewer moving
parts, and industrial-grade
components--what does
this mean for our

customers? No scheduled
maintenance required.
While our competitors
average two unscheduled
maintenance events per
day, we average only one

per year.

#### ARRAY FOLLOW THE SUN.

T E C H N O L O G I E S FOLLOW THE LEADER.

COST VERSUS VALUE

We believe value is more than the cost of a tracking
system. It’s about building with forgiving tolerances
and fewer parts so construction crews can work
effi ciently. It means protecting your investment with
a failure-free wind management system. It also
includes increasing power density. But most of all,
value is measured in operational uptime, or reliability.

THE GLOBAL LEADER IN RELIABILITY

Array has spent decades designing and perfecting
the most reliable tracker on the planet. Fewer
moving parts, stronger components and intelligent
design that protects your investment in the
harshest weather are but a few of the innovative
diff erences that keep your system running
fl awlessly all day and you resting easy at night.
