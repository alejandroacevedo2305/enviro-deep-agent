c. equipment and machines;

Protection of the Ecological Balance

d. ventilation systems which collect vehicle exhaust gases and discharge them
as waste air into the environment.

2 _Vehicles_ means motor vehicles, aircraft, ships and railways.

3 _Transport infrastructure_ means roads, airfields, railway tracks and other installations where vehicle exhaust gases are released into the environment as waste air
without being collected.

4 _New installations_ also includes installations which are altered, extended or repaired
if:

a. higher or different emissions are to be expected as a result or

b. the costs incurred amount to more than half those of a new installation.

5 Ambient air pollution levels are _excessive_ if one or more of the ambient limit
values specified in Annex 7 is exceeded. If no such limit values are specified for a
pollutant, ambient air pollution levels shall be considered excessive if:

a. they endanger human beings, animals, plants or their biological communities
or habitats;

b. a survey establishes that they significantly affect the well-being of a substantial proportion of the population;

c. they damage buildings or

d. they harm soil fertility, vegetation or waters.

6 _Placing on the market_ means the transfer or disposal for the first time, whether or
not for consideration, of equipment or machines for distribution or use in Switzerland. Equivalent to placing on the market is the commissioning, for the first time, of
equipment or machines at one's own enterprise in cases where placing on the market
has not previously occurred. [4]

**Chapter 2: Emissions**

**Section 1: Limitation of Emissions from New Stationary Installations**

**Art. 3** Preventive limitation of emissions in accordance with Annexes 1-4

1 New stationary installations shall be equipped and operated in such a way that they
comply with the limitation of emissions specified in Annex 1.

2 Additional or different requirements apply in the case of the following installations:

a. installations listed in Annex 2: the requirements specified therein;

b. combustion installations: the requirements specified in Annex 3;

Air Pollution Control Ordinance

**814.318.142.1**

c. [5] construction machines and particle filter systems as specified in Article 19 _a_,
combustion installations as specified in Article 20 and machinery as specified in Article 20 _b_ : the requirements specified in Annex 4.

**Art. 4** Preventive limitation of emissions specified by the authorities

1 Emissions for which no limitation is specified in this Ordinance or for which a
particular limitation is declared not to be applicable, shall be limited preventively by
the authorities as far as is technically and operationally feasible and economically
acceptable.

2 Emission limitation measures are technically and operationally feasible if they:

a. have been successfully tested at comparable installations in Switzerland or
abroad or

b. have been successfully applied in experiments and can be transferred to
other installations from a technological perspective.

3 The assessment of the economic acceptability of emission limitations shall be
based on an average, economically sound enterprise in the relevant sector. If a
particular sector contains widely differing classes of enterprises, the assessment shall
be based on an average enterprise of the relevant class.

**Art. 5** Stricter limitation of emissions ordered by the authorities

1 If an individual planned installation is expected to cause excessive ambient air
pollution levels even though the preventive emission limitation requirements are
met, the authorities shall order additional or stricter emission limitation requirements
for the installation concerned.

2 The emission limitation requirements are to be supplemented or tightened to such
an extent that no excessive ambient air pollution levels are caused.

**Art. 6** Capture and removal of emissions [6]

1 Emissions shall be captured as fully and as close to the source as possible and shall
be removed in such a way as to prevent excessive ambient air pollution levels. [7]

2 They shall generally be discharged above roof level via stacks or waste air ducts.

3 Annex 6 applies to stacks. If the required stack height H cannot be realised, or if
the parameter H 0 is more than 100 m, the authorities shall as an alternative tighten
the emission limitation requirements specified in Annexes 1-3.

**Section 2:**
**Limitation of Emissions from Existing Stationary Installations**

**Art. 7** Preventive limitation of emissions

The provisions concerning preventive limitation of emissions from new stationary
installations (Articles 3, 4 and 6) also apply to existing stationary installations.

**Art. 8** Mandatory retrofitting

1 The authorities shall ensure that existing stationary installations which do not meet
the requirements of this Ordinance undergo retrofitting.

2 They shall issue the necessary rulings, specifying the time limit for retrofitting in
accordance with Article 10. If necessary, they shall order operating restrictions or
the shutdown of the installation for the duration of the retrofitting work. [8]

3 Retrofitting need not be carried out if the owner undertakes to shut down the installation within the time limit set for retrofitting.

**Art. 9** Stricter limitation of emissions

1 If it is established that an individual existing installation is causing excessive
ambient air pollution levels even if the preventive emission limitation requirements
are complied with, the authorities shall order additional or stricter emission limitation requirements for the installation concerned.

2 The emission limitation requirements are to be supplemented or tightened to such
an extent that excessive ambient air pollution levels are no longer caused.

3 The additional or stricter emission limitation requirements are to be imposed by
means of retrofitting rulings with time limits set in accordance with Article 10,
paragraph 2. If necessary, the authorities shall order operating restrictions or the
shutdown of the installation for the duration of the retrofitting work.

4 If excessive ambient air pollution levels are caused by more than one installation,
the procedure specified in Articles 31-34 shall be followed.

**Art. 10** [9] Time limits for retrofitting

1 The standard time limit for retrofitting is five years.

2 Shorter time limits, but not less than 30 days, shall be set if:

a. retrofitting can be carried out without significant investments;

b. emissions are more than three times the value specified for preventive limitation of emissions, or

Air Pollution Control Ordinance

**814.318.142.1**

c. ambient air pollution levels caused by the installation alone are excessive.

3 Longer time limits, up to a maximum of ten years, shall be set if:

a. emissions are less than one-and-a-half times the value applicable for preventive limitation of emissions, or the provisions concerning exhaust gas losses
are not complied with and

b. neither letter a nor letter c of paragraph 2 is met.

4 The above is without prejudice to the ordering of shorter time limits for retrofitting
in accordance with Article 32.

**Art. 11** Relief

1 On request, the authorities shall grant relief to the owner of an installation if retrofitting in accordance with Articles 8 and 10 would be disproportionate, in particular
not technically or operationally feasible, or economically unacceptable.

2 By way of relief, the authorities may in the first instance grant longer time limits. If
the granting of longer time limits is not sufficient, the authorities shall specify less
strict limitation of emissions.

**Section 3: Control of Stationary Installations**

**Art. 12** Emission declaration

1 Anyone who operates or wishes to construct an installation which causes air pollution shall provide the authorities with information on:

a. the type and level of emissions;

b. the release location, release height and time course of emissions;

c. other release conditions required for the assessment of emissions.

2 The emission declaration may be based on measurements or on material balances
of the substances used.

**Art. 13** Emission measurements and inspections

1 The authorities shall monitor compliance with emission limitation requirements.
They shall carry out their own emission measurements or inspections or shall have
these carried out on their behalf.

2 If possible, the first measurement or inspection shall be carried out within three
months, but no later than twelve months, after the commissioning of the new or
retrofitted installation.

**2** **Definitions**

**21** **Exhaust gases**

_Exhaust gases_ means waste air, flue gases and other air pollutants discharged by
installations.

**22** **Emissions**

Emissions are expressed in the following terms:

a. Concentration:
Mass of emitted substance in relation to the volume of exhaust gas (e.g. in
milligrams per cubic metre [mg/m [3] ]);

b. Mass flow:
Mass of emitted substance per unit time (e.g. in grams per hour [g/h]);

c. Emission factor:
Ratio of the mass of emitted substance to the mass of the products generated
or processed (e.g. in kilograms per tonne [kg/t]);

**814.318.142.1**

e. Smoke number:
The degree of filter blackening caused by exhaust gases. The grey scale used
to determine the Bacharach smoke number ranges from 0 to 9 in unit steps.

**23** **Reference value for emission concentrations**

1 The limit values expressed as concentrations and the oxygen contents given as
reference values are based on the volume of exhaust gas under standard conditions
(0°C, 1013 mbar) after deduction of the moisture content (dry).

2 The limit values expressed as emission concentrations are based on the amount of
exhaust gas which is no more heavily diluted than is technically and operationally
unavoidable.

3 If oxygen content by volume is given as the reference value for an installation
listed in Annexes 2-4, the measured emission concentrations are to be corrected to
this reference value.

**24** **Rated thermal input**

The rated thermal input is the thermal energy supplied to an installation per unit
time. It is obtained by multiplying the fuel consumption of the installation by the
lower calorific value of the fuel.

**3** **General provisions**

**31** **Limitation of emissions**

1 The following emission limitation requirements apply:

a. for dust: Number 4;

b. for inorganic substances, mainly in the form of dust: Number 5;

c. for inorganic substances in gaseous or vaporous form: Number 6;

d. for organic substances in gaseous, vaporous or particulate form: Number 7;

e. for carcinogens: Number 8.

2 Substances not listed in Numbers 5-8 shall be assigned to the substance classes
which have comparable effects on the environment. Account shall be taken in particular of degradability and bio-accumulability, toxicity, the effects of decomposition processes and transformation products, and odour intensity.

Protection of the Ecological Balance

**32** **Limitation of emissions dependent on installation size**

1 If there is more than one emission source and if emission limitation requirements
depend on the size of an installation (e.g. capacity or mass flow), the authorities
shall determine which emission sources shall collectively be considered to constitute
a single installation.

2 Emission sources are generally to be considered as a single installation if they are
situated in close proximity to each other and if their emissions:

a. essentially contain the same or similar pollutants, or

b. can be reduced using the same technology.

3 Parts of an installation which only serve as back-ups in the event of malfunctions
are not taken into account when determining the size of the installation.

4 Emission limit values which depend on a certain mass flow shall only apply if:

a. this mass flow is reached or exceeded for more than five hours per week, or

b. double this mass flow is reached or exceeded for a shorter period.

**4** **Dust**

**41** **Limit value for total dust**

If the mass flow of dust is 0.20 kg/h or more, total dust emissions must not exceed
20 mg/m [3] .

**42** **Limitation of exposure to components of dust**

The requirements specified in Numbers 5, 7 and 8 apply for the limitation of exposure to individual components of dust.

**43** **Measures relating to treatment, storage, transshipment**
**and transport**

1 If significant dust emissions may occur in commercial or industrial facilities as a
result of processes such as the conveyance, crushing, sorting or filling of dustforming materials, the dust-containing exhaust gases must be captured and fed into a
dust removal system.

2 When dust-forming materials are stored or transshipped in the open, measures must
be taken to prevent significant dust emissions.

3 When dust-forming materials are transported, transport equipment must be used
which prevents significant dust emissions.

4 If traffic on factory roads may cause significant dust emissions, the roads must be
kept free of dust.

Air Pollution Control Ordinance

**Minimum stack height**

**1** **Scope**

**814.318.142.1**

_Annex 6_ _[78]_
(Article 6 paragraph 3)

The provisions of this Annex apply to installations for which the quantity Q/S exceeds 5, where:

Q = mass flow of the emitted air pollutant in grams per hour;

S = value calculated in accordance with Number 9.

**2** **Calculation method**

1 The required physical stack height is calculated step by step in accordance with
Numbers 3 to 6.

2 If more than one air pollutant is emitted, the physical stack height is calculated on
the basis of the pollutant for which the quantity Q/S has the highest value.

**3** **Parameter H** **0**

**31** **Determination of H** **0** **according to Diagram 1**

1
The parameter H 0 takes account of the short-term effects of the air pollutants
emitted from a single installation. It is determined with the aid of Diagram 1.

2 The quantities Q and F depend on the emission conditions at the installation. The
full load values and the fuel/emission conditions most conducive to air pollution are
used to calculate H 0 .

3 The quantity S is used to limit the maximum short-term ambient air pollution
levels caused by the installation to a specific value (S value). The S values specified
in Number 9 are used to calculate H 0 .

**32** **Determination of H** **0** **in individual cases**

1
The parameter H 0 is determined in individual cases according to the recognised
rules for calculating the stack height and the dispersion of flue gases if:

a. the Q/S or F values lie outside Diagram 1 or

b. the flue gas temperature is less than 55°C.

78 Corrected in accordance with No II of the Ordinance of 15 Dec. 1997, in force since
1 March 1998 (AS **1998** 223).

81

**814.318.142.1**

Protection of the Ecological Balance

2 However, where flue gas temperatures are below 55°C, the parameter H 0 must not
be lower than the value which is obtained according to Diagram 1 for a temperature
of 55°C.

**4** **Minimum height for flat, obstacle-free terrain**

1 The stack height for flat, obstacle-free terrain is
H 1 = f x H 0
The correction factor f takes account of long-term effects due to wind channelling.

2 Values between 1.0 and 1.5 are used for f as follows:
f = 1.00 for sites with no prevailing wind direction;
f = 1.25 for sites with average conditions;
f = 1.50 for valleys with pronounced wind channelling.

3 Intermediate values are also possible for f, depending on the site conditions.

**5** **Height increase for buildings and vegetation**

Elevated objects (buildings and vegetation) in the vicinity of the stack are taken into
account by means of a height increase I 1 :
I 1 = g x I

where:
I = Height of the highest significant obstacle area in the region affected by the
installation. Values between 0 (no obstacles) and 30 m (e.g. forest) are used for
I.
g = Correction factor, with values between 0 and 1 according to Diagram 2.

**6** **Physical stack height**

The physical stack height H is calculated according to the following formula:

H = H 1 + I 1

**7** **More stringent requirements**

In justified cases, the authorities will require taller stacks, for example, in the case
of:

a. structures with particular shapes;

b sites with particularly poor meteorological dispersion conditions;

c. particular topographical conditions, such as narrow valleys, hillsides or depressions.
