_Enforceability and implementation of the regulations_
The figures quoted as standards in the permit must
preferably be validated by recalculation on the basis of
changed (annual) production statistics using the
‘geurnorm .’ software. Verification of the presence of
and adherence to the instructions for the use of end-of
pipe technology (where applicable) can be carried out
at the same time. The standard to be met must

preferably be specified in the form of the distance from
the facility at which the  ou E /m [] contour can be
drawn.

**Interpretation of the regulation**

For additional information (for example in the case of lack

of clarity as regards the interpretation of the regulation)

InfoMil can be consulted. Feed compounders can also

contact the study group _Milieu Overlegplatform_

_Mengvoederindustrie_ (MOM) of the _Federatief_

_OverlegOrgaan Mengvoederindustrie_ (FOOM) based in

Rotterdam.

**B1** **Sugar factories**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Particulates_

The concentration of particulates in emissions from
the multi-cyclones of the pulp-drying plant may not
exceed  mg/m  .
When existing pulp-drying plants are renewed, steam
drying can be considered as an alternative to the
present method of pulp drying, notably in the light of
measures to limit odour emissions and on energy
grounds.
Where steam drying is used, the general standards for
particulates apply.

_Ammonia_

On the basis of the findings of research already
underway into the removal of ammonia from the waste
gases of the carbonation process, the most efficient
treatment system will have to be implemented for the
situation in question at the appropriate time.
It concerns the following technologies:

- use of the relevant air flows as combustion air for the
pulp dryers and for the boiler house; and

- process integrated nitrification/denitrification of the
relevant process flows.

**B2** **Production of starch and**

**starch derivatives**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in May _
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Particulates_

The concentration of dust in emissions from the

starch-drying plant should be between  and a
maximum of  mg/m o .*
The value stipulated in the licence will depend on the
nature of the particulates and will need to be fixed on a
case by case basis.
The aim should be to comply with the general
standards.

**Production of modified starch**

The general standards of the NeR are applicable to

emissions from the raw materials and additives used in the

production of modified starch.

_Production of nylgum_
Ammonia emission in the production of nylgum must
be reduced with an efficiency of at least %.**

- When potato starch is used,  mg/m o is feasible. For maize
starch,  mg/m  is a realistic value.
**The feasibility of this standard is still the subject of
consultations and research.

**B3** **Large bakeries**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in January ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Scope_
This regulation only applies to bread bakeries requiring
a permit that produce an average range of products. It
concerns operators who are registered with the
Industrial Board for the bakery trade (Bedrijfschap voor
het Bakkersbedrijf) and who do not fall under a  in
pursuance of Article . of Wm (Environmental
Protection Act). This includes both operators who
manufacture their products in a traditional manner and
operators who produce on an industrial scale.

**Scope**

The regulations apply exclusively to larger bakeries where

bread and a limited variety of other products are baked,

which do not fall under the Decree on environmental control

of the retail trade and crafts. It concerns approximately

400 large and medium-sized bakeries (state of affairs as of

1995). These bakeries mainly bake bread, but also

produce, among other things, buns and rolls, fruit loafs,

sausage rolls, cheese-and-onion baguettes, apple jacks,

cake, etc. Research has shown that when up to 35% of the

total amount of flour is processed into buns and rolls a

single key emission factor can be used.

_Sources of emissions_
Sources are the waste gases (flue gases and fumes
produced by the products, with a high moisture
content) from the oven and the air vented from the
oven rooms and bread cooling areas for ventilation
purposes. The odours produced by the various sources
is of a comparable nature.

**Sources of emissions**

For the total odour emissions from bakeries a key emission figure

has been established on the basis of research*. This number is

expressed as millions of Dutch odour units per sack of flour.

The research has also shown that variability of process

variables and types of bread, including special products

that are part of a typical range, has no demonstrable impact

on the scale of the odour emissions, with the exception of

the percentage of buns and rolls that is being baked.

 - ‘Industry-wide investigation into odour emissions from bread bakeries’,

performed under the authority of NBS by DHV Milieu & Infrastructuur, January

1995, MT-RE944418 and ‘Results of research by telephone into living conditions

(TLO) performed in the vicinity of bread bakeries’, August 1995, MT/RE950059

(can be ordered from Nederlandse Bakkerij Stichting, The Hague). (In Dutch only.)

_Nuisance level and limit values_

In these regulations no maximum odour concentration
level is specified. The reason is that no correlation
could be established between actual odour

concentrations and the percentage of people
experiencing of odour nuisance.
Quantitative verification of the emission or immission
within the framework of issuing permits is therefore
not a good idea.
Nuisance caused by odours produced by bakeries is
rarely reported. As a rule acceptable nuisance levels will
not be exceeded if the measures indicated in these

regulations are implemented.

**Nuisance level and verifying compliance with standards**

In these regulations no numerical specifications for odour

levels are included. The main reason is that no clear

correlation could be established between actual odour

concentrations and the percentage of people complaining

of odour nuisance. From the research by telephone into

living conditions (TLO) that was carried out in the vicinity of

eight bakeries it was found that in the case of an exposure

to more than 8 ou E /m [3] as 98 [th] percentile, not more than 8%

of respondents reported experiencing nuisance. This group

was exposed to concentrations between 16 and (an

indicative maximum of) 55 ou E /m [3] . None of the

respondents indicated that they experienced major odour

nuisance due to the bakeries. Around the 8 bakeries there

were never more than 12% people complaining of odour

nuisance. The arrangements as regards the nuisance

situation are based on the TLO carried out in August 1995.

It is found under the actual conditions, too, that problems

with odour nuisance are relatively rare within this branch of

industry.

Considering the above a qualitative assessment is

considered to suffice.

Implementing the measures indicated will not result in

complete prevention of odours. But the fact alone that

odours produced by bakeries are noticeable does not

necessarily mean that anyone will experience nuisance.

_Measures_

The set of measures and facilities relevant in the case of

bakeries consists of:

- Extraction by mechanical means or through natural
draught of vapours by means of an extractor placed
over the point where the finished product leaves the
oven. Both the vapours and the flue gases must be
vented to the atmosphere through a suitable
ventilation shaft/stack and dispersion in the bakery
must be prevented.

- Letting bread cool down must always be done
indoors.

- The emission point of vapours and oven flue gases
must extend a minimum of  metre above the

highest rooftop found within  metres of the
emission point, unless it is expected that no relevant
influence on the dispersion will occur due to
adjacent buildings.

Where objects sensitive to odour nuisance are found
within  metres of the emission point:

- every rain hood must be constructed in such a way
that the vertical outflow of gases is not restricted;
when existing emission points are replaced,
unobstructed vertical outflow must be ensured under
all circumstances;

- all emissions of ventilation air from baking and
cooling areas must occur above roof level.

**Measures**

The Special Regulations specify measures which can be

made obligatory if nuisance occurs or is expected. Almost

80% of total odour emissions originate from the ovens. For

this reason an effective dispersion of vapours and oven flue

gases into the surrounding area should be the first line of

approach. Only in situations where the odour nuisance

occurs close to the bakeries dispersion of ventilation air

from the production areas deserves further attention.

Influx of air through open windows or doors or ventilation

openings in the outer walls of the building does not have

any impact on the dispersion of odours.

Effective dispersion of the emissions is a key consideration

in deciding whether an emission point must extend to above

the buildings in the vicinity. In the case of certain buildings,

extensions or superstructures such as for example a silo park

it may reasonably be expected that they have a limited

impact on the dispersion. The local situation will be the

deciding factor in your considerations.

In certain especially problematic situations extension of the

emission point (to more than 1 metre above roof level) can

be considered within the framework of the ALARA principle.

End-of-pipe technology is not used under the actual

conditions to our knowledge.

**B4** **Rusk and pastry bakeries**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in January ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Scope_
These regulations appertain to existing operations and
extensions thereof which produce rusks and pastries on
an industrial scale and do not fall under a 

pursuant to Article . of the Wm (Environmental
Protection Act).

_Sources_

Odour emissions from rusk and pastry bakeries
originate from the ovens and building ventilation.
Industry-wide research into odour* has yielded key
emission figures for both sources for various categories
of products (please refer to table ).

**(10** **[6]** **ou** **E** **/tonne)**

The scale of the odour emissions per hour can be
calculated by multiplying the production per unit of
time (in tonnes per hour) with the key emission figure
per product group. In this context the values found
and averaged over time (weighed by time of day) of the
periods during which emissions occur are considered as
relevant (please refer to the calculation example for the
method of taking the operating period into account).

**Categories of products**

The categories of products produced in the industry are the

basis on which the listing below is based. Various products

not explicitly mentioned can easily be assigned to one of the

categories mentioned.

 - _Pastries with a high moisture content (fresh and deep_

_frozen):_ choux pastry (with various types of icing), cream

slices, apple dumplings/fritters, cream-filled cakes, puff

pastry with various fillings, sponge cakes with fruit

toppings, fruit tarts, cake based pastries, apple pie, etc.

 - _Confectionery (cookies and remaining types of pastry):_

short biscuits, shortbread/shortcake, (puff) pastry with or

without almond paste, meringues, sponges, cookies with

mixed spices, etc.

 - _Cake loaf (and gingerbread):_ various types of ginger loaf

(with spices, ginger, dried fruits), gingerbread, etc.

 - _Non-sweet pastries (cookies and remaining types of_

_pastry):_ cheese sticks, savoury sticks, puff pastry shells

and other products, semi-finished products, etc.

 - _Waffles:_ oublie waffles, treacle waffles, filled waffles,

etc.

 - _Biscuits:_ petit beurre, tea biscuits, digestives, Marie

biscuits, chocolate covered biscuits, army biscuits, health

and lifestyle biscuits, filled biscuits, biscuits with

(desiccated) coconut, etc.

 - _Rusks (and toast):_ rusk rolls, rusks, wholemeal rusks, etc.

_Dispersion_
On the basis of the average odour emission level (in
ou E per hour) and the effective level of discharge it is
possible to determine the distance at which a certain
concentration occurs in the surrounding area.

To this end the nomograms in Figures  through ,
which are derived from the  model, can be used.
For operating situations with multiple emission points
the height and location of the individual emission
points can be averaged.

_Nuisance_
A level of  ou E /m [] as  [th] percentile in the built-up
areas or other objects sensitive to odour involved must
be used as a target not to be exceeded.

- Industry-wide investigation into odour emissions from pastry
bakeries,  report -, can be ordered from Verbisko, The
Hague (in Dutch only).

**Nuisance**

The correlation between odour concentration and nuisance

has been determined at a single operator in the sector of

industry involved*, among other reasons because not many

situations exist where the limiting conditions for a TLO are

met. The results of this TLO indicate that in the situation

considered at the time the level of 12% people complaining

of odour nuisance occurred in the case of an emission level

of 5 ou E /m [3] as 98 [th] percentile.

In adopting the value of 5 ou E /m [3] as 98 [th] percentile as a

target, the technically feasible measures and a number of

economic data were taken into consideration, in addition to

the nature of the odours and the complaint situations on

record. It is a value to which exceptions can be made in

rare cases and on duly stated grounds, on the grounds of

local considerations and of a weighing of the aimed for

results against the business economics consequences.

 - Nuisance poll on the pastry manufacturing industry, TNO R95-224, can

be ordered from Verbisco, The Hague (in Dutch only).

_Measures_

Potential measures to be taken in the case of reported

nuisance are:

For the ovens:

- raising the emission points of the ovens, a measure
which has its limits due to technical aspects related
to the construction of the ovens; where the effect of
raising individual emission points is expected to be
insufficient the waste gases can (partially) be vented
via a common waste gas duct to a central, elevated
emission point.
For ventilation air:

- use of forced exhaustion of the air in the production
halls and reducing the possibility of fugitive
dispersion; such measures are especially effective if
the distance to the objects sensitive to odour
nuisance is less than  metres.

Generally speaking, the  model has not been
validated for distances under  m. It has been found,
though, that when the emission points are raised to an
effective height of between  and  metres the odour
concentration at distances of less than  metres from

the source will drop to under  ou E /m [] .

**Measures**

Raising the emission points of the ovens can technically

speaking be deemed to have general applicability. The

maximum height which can be demanded depends on the

situation, and is determined by the technical options offered

by the construction. In general the extensions are limited to

a length of 8 m upwards of the oven roofs and

approximately 6 m above roof level.

Combining several emission points and venting them via a

central elevated stack is technically feasible, but this has an

impact on the baking properties of the oven. Other options

available in order to limit the emissions further have not

emerged from the research.

In situations where the nuisance occurs within 100 m of an

operation use of the nomograms is inappropriate. Inside the

range of 100 m the validity of the model on which the

nomograms are based is limited. By raising the emission

point it can be guaranteed that the concentration of

5 ou E /m [3] as 98 [th] percentile is not exceeded at distances of

less than 100 m from the emission point. To this end it will

be necessary, depending on the scale of the production, to

demand an effective height of between 10 and 25 m.

Any restrictions on the height to which the emission points

can be raised within the context of physical planning

requirements must be resolved giving due attention to the

situation at the operator involved.

The costs of the measures mentioned in these regulations

measures are considered reasonable by the industry as a

whole. However, the costs of raising the (central) emission

point(s) of the oven waste gases can vary considerably

depending on the number of emission points and the local

situation at the operator’s.

In individual situations it must be investigated whether, and

to what extent, raising the (central) emission point(s) and/or

implementing forced exhaustion of air from the production

halls is considered necessary and justifiable. For both

measures the costs can be considerable both in terms of the

level of investment required and the financial resources of

the average operator in this sector. The nature of the odours

and the fact whether other environment protection measures

are also taken can be taken into consideration in taking the

final decision.

**Calculation example to demonstrate how the operating**

**period must be taken into account**

_Production statistics_

Product A is produced during in total 2500 hours per year,

product B during 3000 hours and product C during 4500

hours per year.

_Taking the operating period into account_

The annual operating period of an operator is equal to the

longest annual production period of a certain product

group, in this case 4500 hours. For the operating period the

nomograms offer four possible values.

The emission factor for a given product is calculated by

multiplying the key figure for that product group given in

table 1 with the production per hour. The emission factor for

product A is therefore an emission expressed in ou E per

hour. The same applies to B and C. On the basis of these

values the total emission is calculated.

Total emission for product A: emission factor product A

(efA) x 2500 hours

Total emission for product B: emission factor product B

(efB) x 3000 hours

Total emission for product C: emission factor product C

(efC) x 4500 hours

Total annual emission: 2500 x efA + 3000 x efB

+ 4500 x efC (ou E /year)

The average emission per hour is calculated by dividing the

total annual emission by the operating period:

(2500 x efA + 3000 x efB + 4500 x efC)/4500

On the basis of the calculated odour emission it is possible,

for a given effective level of discharge and the assumed

annual operating period, to determine the distance at which

the concentration of 5 ou E /m [3] occurs from the nomogram.

The operating period in the example is 4500 hours per year.

The distance can be read from the nomogram for a 4000

hours operating period.

**B5** **Meat industry**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in January ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

Within the meat industry various activities are
distinguished. The industry-wide investigation into
odours in the meat industry has resulted in a list of
odour emissions from the activities distinguished in the
meat industry and also established the correlation
between the odour nuisance and the subjectively
perceived nuisance. The aspect of odour nuisance is
relevant for slaughterhouses, fat rendering plants and
producers of meat products. For these activities
separate odour concentration levels are included in
§,  and  of these regulations.
For the meat processing sector in  the publication
‘ _Werkboek milieumaatregelen vleesindustrie_ (Workbook
on environment protection measures in the meat
industry)’ with measures which can be included in the
permit through reference to company environmental
plans (s).

**Emission factors**

The emission factors in the tables in these regulations are

derived from the industry-wide investigation (Report:

‘ _Bedrijfstakstudie geur vleesindustrie_ (Industry-wide

investigation into odours in the meat industry)’, PRA report

number pvf493a3, 1994, under the authority of the

Produktschap voor Vee, Vlees en Eieren (Commodity Board

for Livestock, Meat and Eggs)). For more background

information and calculation examples please refer to this

publication.

**1 Slaughterhouses**
_Scope_
These regulations are applicable to slaughterhouses
requiring a permit for pigs, cattle, calves, sheep,
chickens, turkeys and ducks, as well as casualty
slaughtering locations.

_Sources of emission_
The odour emission for each facility is determined by
adding up the odour emissions per unit using the
pertinent odour emission factors. These are listed in
table  through .
The odour emissions from slaughterhouses must
initially be considered without taking the contribution
of the waste water treatment plant into account. If it is
found on the basis of the indicative emission factors

that the emission from the sewage treatment plant
() makes a relevant contribution to the overall
emission it may become necessary to carry out further
research into this emission.

As a rule a well-dimensioned and well-operated 
will not give rise to odour related problems.
With the aid of the calculated odour emissions and the

nomograms in the regulations (tables  through  and
figures  through ) it can be established at which
distance the odour concentrations indicated in these

regulations occur.

_Nuisance level_
An odour concentration level of . ou E /m [] as  [th]

percentile in the built-up areas or other objects
sensitive to odours involved may not be exceeded.
Where odour abatement measures are taken this value

must be met or improved on.
Where the odour concentration is between . and
. ou E /m [] as  [th] percentile the competent
administrative body must decide whether measures
aimed at further reduction are necessary. For assessing
the situation odour nuisance classification system must
be used (refer to §.).
Below a calculated odour concentration of . ou E /m []

as  [th] percentile measures are not necessary.

**Nuisance level**

On the basis of (among other things) the industry-wide

investigation into the correlation between odour nuisance

and subjectively perceived nuisance, the options offered by

Best Available Control Technology and the cost benefit

analysis at industry level it has been concluded that in most

cases no measures are required if the odour concentration at

the nearest object that has to be protected is lower than

0.55 ou E /m [3] as 98 [th] percentile. It is very unlikely that

nuisance will be experienced at levels below this value. In

the case of odour nuisance levels higher than 1.5 ou E /m [3]

measures will be required in almost all situations. The level of

1.5 ou E /m [3] must be applied as a limit value to which

exceptions are only possible in exceptional cases, which

exceptions are only possible on duly stated grounds. In the

case of concentrations between 0.55 and 1.5 ou E /m [3] the

measures contemplated must be assessed within the context

of the local situation to determine whether they are

necessary and economically feasible. The competent

authorities will determine which objects sensitive to odour

nuisance must be protected in accordance with the given

maximum nuisance levels. In this context it will be taken into

account that there must be a fair balance between the effort

demanded from the permit holder and the effect on the

environment one seeks to achieve. This careful consideration

may result under the actual conditions in the case of

scattered dwellings or dwellings on an industrial estate in a

higher odour nuisance level being declared acceptable.

If an operator implements measures which reduce the

concentration from levels in excess of 1.5 ou E /m [3] to a value

between 0.55 and 1.5 ou E /m [3] it must be pointed out to the

applicant that more stringent measures can be demanded if

the residual nuisance is deemed unacceptable. It will be

advisable to lay down arrangements regarding the phased

implementation of such measures.

The value of 1.5 ou E /m [3] as 98 [th] percentile is considered to

constitute the borderline between that which is desirable

from an environment protection point of view and that which

is feasible from a business economics point of view. At the

time when the regulations were adopted approximately

20 per cent of operators fell into the intermediate category

with emissions of between 0.55 and 1.5 ou E /m [3] .

_Measures_

For slaughterhouses the possible measures can be
subcategorised according to their nature, namely as
organisational/good housekeeping measures, process
integrated measures and end-of-pipe technologies. The
following measures fall under ‘good housekeeping’.

**Table 1** **Good housekeeping measures**

 - Keeping the washing facilities clean

 - Shower installations in the lairages in order to limit stress

 - Keeping floors and walls clean

 - Daily removal from the premises of materials destined for rendering

 - Reduction of drip water

In addition to these good housekeeping measures, it is
indicated in the following tables per type of
slaughterhouse and per source distinguished which
measures, from which a selection can be made in order
to comply with the desired reduction of odour levels,
are possible.

**Measures**

As regards the actual measures to be taken, this is left to the

consultations between operators and the competent

administrative body. There is no preference for certain types

of measures. The order of the options listed in the tables

does not constitute a ranking according to preference.

Where the columns ‘process integrated’ and

‘organisational’ do not specify any measures the rule

applies that no process related measures of general

applicability have been determined. If in individual cases

possibilities for such measures present themselves, they

should in principle be preferred.

Generally speaking, measures must be devised which have

a maximum effect (and are as cost effective as possible). It

usually makes sense to try to control the sources with the

greatest impact first.

**Slaughterhouses**

Determining the odour emission is done by multiplying the

emission factors per part of the slaughterhouse by the

determinant unit (number of animals, lorries etc). By adding

up the emission flows obtained in this way for each part of

the process the total emission can be calculated.

In the case of odour emissions of less than 5 x 10 [6] ou E /hour

it is usually possible for all types of slaughterhouses to

decide against measures aimed at limiting odour emissions

in addition to the basic measures.

The necessity of determining the actual odour emissions is

not relevant in most cases if the production capacity per

hour does not exceed 8 pigs, 5 cattle, 14 calves, 54 sheep,

400 chickens, 56 turkeys or 28 toms, or 300 ducks. For the

purpose of this assessment it is valid in the case of horses to

use the same criteria that apply in the case of cattle, in the

case of goats to use those for sheep.

In the case of casualty slaughtering or slaughterhouses where

more than one species of animal is processed the odour

emissions are determined in proportion to the contributions

made by the various categories of animals distinguished here

(a calculation that can serve as an example is quoted in the

report on the industry-wide investigation).

may be necessary to do a calculation using the applicable

National model on the basis of emissions from more than

one source in order to obtain a more accurate estimate.

The distance at which the concentration indicated in the

regulations occurs due to the odour emissions can be

determined using the nomograms (Figures 1 and 2).

To this end the subjectively weighted imaginary origin of the

odours is situated at the scorching/singeing oven in the case

of pig slaughter halls and at the most significant source in the

case of other slaughterhouses. This assumption can give rise

to inaccuracies where the distances between the various

sources are large as compared to the distance at which the

odour concentration must be determined. In such cases it

**Waste water treatment plant**

The contribution of a waste water treatment plant (STP)

cannot be incorporated in the calculations used for

quantifying the total odour emissions from a meat

processing operator because this factor - in contrast to the

odour emissions from the other individual processes - is

continuous by nature. The key emission figures listed below

serve to provide an insight into the ratios of the emissions by

the various sources of the STP in comparison to the

production process and, based on these findings, to decide

on the relevance of further research (if any) into the

emissions contributed by the STP. Because of a substantial

variability in the implementation, dimensioning and manner

of operating of STPs the information quoted can only serve

as an indication.

**Table 8** **Emission factors for waste water treatment plant**

**2 Fat rendering plants**
For slaughterhouses where in addition to the sources
mentioned a fat rendering plant is present the rule
applies that the odour emissions resulting from this
facility must be added to the emissions from the
remaining sources.
The emission factors for fat rendering plants are
indicated in Table .

For dry rendering plants no practicable emission factor
could be derived from the report on the industry-wide
investigation into odours produced by fat rendering
plants (Report: _‘Bedrijfstakstudie geur vetsmelterijen_
(Report on the industry-wide investigation into odours
produced by fat rendering plants’), , , report
number bofea; can be ordered from the Bofed).
Fat rendering plants which are isolated from
slaughterhouses and operate as a separate facility can be
assessed using the same odour immission
concentrations applicable to slaughterhouses.
In the case of levels in excess of the quoted immission
concentration levels the following measures are
applicable to fat rendering plants:

**Table 9** **Measures for fat rendering plants**

**3 Meat processing plants (including industrial**
**cooking of meats)**
_Scope_
These regulations are applicable to meat processing
operations requiring a permit, including facilities for
the production of fast food items such as hamburgers,
mince and sausages. Exempt from the present
regulations are operators producing other kinds of fast
food,  dinners, ready-made soup and ragout.

_Sources of emission_
The odour emissions from a facility can be determined
on the basis of production quantities and emission
factors (please refer to table ) on a per sub-process
basis. By adding up the values found the total odour
emission is obtained.

If the production of meat products is combined with
slaughtering operations the calculated odour emission
must be added (in proportion to the relative operating
periods) to the emissions resulting from the
slaughtering operations. Than the entire complex
involved in the production of meat products and
slaughtering operations must be assessed using the
criteria for slaughterhouses.
With the aid of the calculated odour emissions and the

nomograms in Figures  and  it can be established at
which distance the odour concentrations indicated in

these regulations occur.

_Nuisance level_
An odour concentration level of . ou E /m [] as  [th]

percentile in the built-up areas or other objects
sensitive to odours involved may not be exceeded.
Where odour abatement measures are taken this value

must be met or improved on.
In the case of an odour concentration level of between
. and . ou E /m [] as  [th] percentile the competent
administrative body must deliberate whether measures
aimed at further reduction are necessary. For assessing
the situation the system used for classifying nuisance
caused by odours must be used (please refer to §.).
Below a calculated odour concentration of . ou E /m []

as  [th] percentile measures are not necessary.

|Col1|Col2|
|---|---|
|good housekeeping|adequate<br>separation of<br>processing fumes<br>and ventilation air|

**Fat rendering plants**

In cases where a fat rendering plant is part of a

slaughterhouse the emission of this facility must be added to

the emissions resulting from the slaughtering operations. The

entire complex will be assessed on the basis of the points of

departure used in the case of standalone slaughterhouses.

The emission factors for fat rendering plants using a wet

process are given in table 10.

**Nuisance level**

On the basis of (among other things) the industry-wide

investigation into the correlation between odour nuisance

and subjectively perceived nuisance, the options offered by

Best Available Control Technology and the cost benefit

analysis at industry level we take the position that in most

cases no measures are required if the odour concentration

at the nearest odour sensitive object, expressed as a value

in ou E /m [3] as 98 [th] percentile, does not exceed

0.95 ou E /m [3] . It is very unlikely that nuisance will be

experienced at levels below this value.

In the case of odour nuisance levels higher than 2.5 ou E /m [3]

measures will be required in almost all situations. The level

of 2.5 ou E /m [3] must be applied as an upper limit to which

exceptions are only possible on duly stated grounds. In the

case of concentrations between 0.95 and 2.5 ou E /m [3] the

contemplated measures must be assessed within the context

of the local situation to determine whether they are

necessary and economically feasible. The competent

authorities will determine which objects sensitive to odour

nuisance must be protected in accordance with the given

maximum nuisance levels.

In this context it will be taken into account that there must be

a fair balance between the effort demanded from the permit

holder and the positive effect on the environment one seeks

to achieve. This careful consideration may result under the

actual conditions in the case of scattered dwellings or

dwellings on an industrial estate in a higher odour nuisance

level being declared acceptable.

If an operator implements measures which reduce the

concentration from levels in excess of 2.5 ou E /m [3] to a value

between 0.95 and 2.5 ou E /m [3] it must be pointed out to the

applicant that more stringent measures can be demanded if

the residual nuisance is deemed unacceptable. It will be

advisable to lay down arrangements regarding the phased

implementation of such measures.

The value of 2.5 ou E /m [3] as 98 [th] percentile is considered to

constitute the borderline between that which is desirable

from an environment protection point of view and that which

is feasible from a business economics point of view. At the

time when the regulations were adopted approximately 20

per cent of operators fell into the intermediate category with

emissions of between 0.95 and 2.5 ou E /m [3] .

_Measures_

For the producers of meat products the potential
measures are indicated in Table . A selection may be
made from these in order to comply with the desired
reduction of odour levels.

**Meat processing plants (including industrial cooking of meats)**

Calculation of the odour emissions from the production of

meat products is based on the table with emission factors

listed below; only the items actually present will be taken into

account, of course. Determining the odour emission is done

by multiplying the emission factors per part of the meat

processing plant by the determinant unit (air flow through the

smokehouse, production). By adding up the emission flows

obtained in this way for each part of the process the total

emission can be calculated.

**Measures**

Based on a list of the sources present and potential

measures it must be determined which measures should be

preferred. On the basis of the expected emission reductions

it can be determined which measures are necessary as a

minimum in order to comply with the desired odour

concentration. The selection of measures that must be taken

will result from consultations between the competent

administrative body and the operator; these parties will

negotiate the measures which are most appropriate to the

situation at hand.

The distance at which the concentration indicated in the

regulations occurs due to the odour emissions can be

determined using the nomograms (Figures 5 and 6).

_These regulations were included in the NeR in January ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Scope_
These Special Regulations are applicable to all existing
operators in The Netherlands that process cocoa beans
and to any extensions to their facilities.

_Sources of odours_
During the processing of cocoa beans odours are
released during pre-processing, preparation, roasting,
grinding and due to ventilation of working areas.
Of the total odour emissions % originate from the
stages of preparing, roasting and grinding.

**Sources of odours**

In table 1 a list is given of sources that are relevant in the

case of processing cocoa beans and of the average emission

factors. The total emissions differ per operator and amount to

between 0.5 and 1.5 million European odour units per

kilogram of cocoa beans. The emission depends on the type

of product and the equipment used.

**Table 1** **Emission factors for the cocoa industry**

The emission factors are quoted from the report: ‘ _Stand van_

_zaken bij het onderzoek naar de geuremissie- en_

_geurimmissie-situatie en de mogelijkheden van bestrijding_

_hiervan bij de cacaobonen-verwerkende industrie_ (State of

affairs in the research into the odour emission and odour

immission situation and the options for eliminating these in

the cocoa beans processing industry)’, February 1995, TNO

Report R95-045.

The relative contribution of the various sources varies

somewhat. The variability of the total emissions is however

less pronounced than the variability per stage of the process,

due to the fact that for example a relatively small emission

due to preparing results in a relatively elevated emission

during the remaining processing stages.

The contribution of the various sources to the odour

immission cannot be summarised unambiguously because

this depends (among other things) on the level of emission,

the heat-content of the waste gases, the situation of the

sources and the distance to the source.

_Limiting odour nuisance_
For the cocoa bean processing industry no
concentration has been established above which the

odour nuisance is considered unacceptable.
On the basis of the  principle a standard set of
measures has been compiled. These measures represent
‘Best Available Control Technology’ for limiting odour
nuisance.

**Limiting odour nuisance**

The cocoa bean processing industry has been making

efforts for many years now to eliminate odour nuisance.

Among other things, this has resulted in a number of

operators investigating and adopting - although the latter

with mixed results - a certain odour emissions reducing

technology. Examples of technologies that have been

implemented are cleaning using biologically active filters

and regenerating incineration.

Completely preventing odour nuisance in the vicinity of

cocoa bean processing industries seems unrealistic, though,

due to the relatively large number of smaller sources of

odours and fugitive sources of odours.

Opting for a practical approach to the odour related

problems, it was decided to devise a standard set of

measures. In this approach all companies concerned must

make an effort with - as much as possible - the same level

of commitment to limit the odour nuisance.

_Measures_

 The waste gases from the preparing, roasting and
grinding stages must be vented via a stack of
sufficient height.
 The remaining waste gases containing odours (such
as ventilation air from working areas and fugitive
sources) must, as much as possible, be redirected to
this stack as well.

 The implementation of process integrated measures
for controlling the odour emissions will be the point
of departure in the case of new investments.

Other measures can be allowed as an alternative to the

above-mentioned measures, provided that at least a
comparable effect is achieved.
On the basis of an evaluation at industry level it will be
assessed whether additional measures are necessary,
such as incineration of (part of) the waste gases.

**Measures**

_1 Height of the stack_

For untreated waste gas flows a height of the stack of 60

metres above ground level is generally sufficient.

In cases involving limited odour emissions, for example due

to a limited production output or due to pre-treatment of the

relevant waste gas flows (for example by incineration), a

lower height of the stack may suffice.

_2 Inclusion of remaining waste gas flows_

On a per operation basis it will have to be established by

drawing up lists of (fugitive) waste gas flows which of these,

with the exception of the three main flows referred to above,

are eligible for being vented to the stack.

In determining whether a given waste gas flow must be

vented though the stack the technical and financial

feasibility will be used as a criterion.

_3 Process integrated measures_

The implementation of process integrated measures in the

case of new investments will be assumed to be ‘company

policy’.

The operator may propose alternative measures. A

precondition in this context is that the effect on immission

levels must be comparable to the effect of erecting a stack.

_Phased implementation_
At the latest on  June  the operators concerned
must submit a strategy document to the competent
authorities for approval. This strategy document will
discuss the phased implementation and the financial
consequences of constructing a stack, give arguments
for or against venting the various sources via the stack,
and discuss scheduled new investments and any
alternative measures being considered.

Limiting conditions in this context are:

- venting the three main flows via the stack has the
highest priority;

- the latest date by which measures  and  must have
been implemented is  December .

**Phased implementation**

In the strategy document the emission of waste gases from

the grinding, preparing and roasting stages must be the

primary concern, also time-wise. Connecting the remaining

(fugitive) waste gas flows may be done step by step over a

longer period of time. However, in dimensioning the stack

these flows must already be taken into account.

The above-mentioned latest date by which the measures

must be implemented of 31 December 1999, must be taken

to constitute the latest date by which ‘the last’ (fugitive)

waste gas flow eligible for being connected to the stack is

connected.

Prompted by (technical) developments the strategy may be

changed, subject to approval by the competent authorities.

**Evaluation**

Evaluation of the measures taken will take place at the local

level on an ongoing basis. In the year 2000 the effect of the

measures will be evaluated at industry level. On the basis of

the actual nuisance situation, any technical developments

and the business economics situation it will be assessed

whether additional measures and amendment of these

Special Regulations are necessary.

**B7** **Coffee-roasting houses**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in January ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Scope_
These regulations are applicable to installations which
are used by coffee-roasting houses excluding
decafeination processes.

**Industry-wide investigation**

These regulations are based on the final report ‘ _Onderzoek_

_naar de geuremissie en de mogelijkheden van vermindering_

_hiervan bij koffiebranderijen_ (Research into the odour

emissions and options for reducing these at coffee-roasting

houses)’ published by the Vereniging van Nederlandse

Koffiebranderijen en Theepakkers (Association of Dutch

Coffee-roasting Houses and Tea Packers).

_Odour emissions_

In Table  the processes responsible for odours are
indicated including the factors that cause odours. It is
also indicated whether it concerns a point source or a
fugitive source. The nature of the odours is exclusively
one recognisable as coffee.

An estimate of the odour emissions can be made with

the aid of the formula given below.

H(tonnes of uncleaned

coffee/year)

E(ou E /hour) = - EF (ou E /tonne of

t(hours during which coffee)

production takes

place/year)

E = emission in European odour units per hour
H = quantity of unroasted coffee beans in tonnes
t = hours during which production takes place

per year
EF = emission factor as determined using Table 

On a per source and per situation basis it must
subsequently be determined what the mass flow, the
temperature and the location of the emissions are. The
dispersion of odours is subsequently calculated using
the applicable National Model.

|Roasting conditions<br>(time and<br>temperature)|Point source, it<br>concerns a stack<br>on the roaster|
|---|---|
|Degree of<br>recirculation||
|Method of heat<br>transfer (fluidised<br>bed or drum)||
|Roasting<br>conditions|Depending on the<br>type of installation,<br>this may be a<br>point source or a<br>fugitive source|
|Cooling method||
|Type of equipment||

**Catalytic incinerator**

On the basis of the industry-wide investigation no emission

factor could be established for burners equipped with a

catalytic incinerator. The calculated effect on odours of a

catalytic incinerator (without recirculation) is 75%.

_Immission levels_
An immission concentration of . ou E /m [],  [th] percentile,
calculated using the formula given in these regulations and
the applicable National Model, may not be exceeded.

**Maximum immission level**

There is not sufficient information available to establish for

the industry generally a correlation between odour

concentrations and odour nuisance. However, on the basis

of the available information yielded by research, including

complaints analysis, and on the basis of the technical and

financial options available to the industry, it has been

concluded that a maximum immission level of 3.5 ou E /m [3],

98 [th] percentile, should not be exceeded.

**New situations**

The immission levels quoted in these regulations apply

exclusively to existing situations.

In new situations such as newly established roasting

facilities and/or newly built dwellings the acceptable level

will be lower. It is recommended that in new situations

sufficient distance be maintained between the coffee

roasting house and the dwellings. Please note that the odour

of coffee in the case of immission concentrations below 3.5

ou E /m [3], 98 [th] percentile, will still be very much in evidence.

**Table 1** **List of sources of odours**

_Measures_

In the case of levels in excess of a calculated odour
immission concentration of . ou E /m [] as  [th]

percentile, measures to limit odours are required. The
measures presented in Table  are relevant to this end.

**Table 2** **List of possible measures (ordered by priority)**

**B8** **Potato processing industry**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in January ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Scope of the regulations_
These regulations are applicable to installations used by
producers of potato products intended for human
consumption, with the exception of producers of
potato starch and derivatives.
In these regulations the following product groups are
distinguished:

- French fries;

- Long-life products;

- Specialties;

- Dried products.
The waste water treatment plant has not been included
in these regulations because it does not give rise to
odour nuisance provided that it is well-designed,
properly installed and correctly operated.

_Odour emissions_

The nature of the odour emissions from operators in
the potato processing industry is determined by the
type of product.
The sources within the distinguished product groups
are listed in Table  in order of significance.
In the regulations for the potato processing industry no
key emission figures are quoted.

**Industry-wide investigation**

In the course of the research in order to determine key

emission figures it was found that considerable variability

exists in the emissions data on the sources which had been

investigated earlier by the operators. It therefore proved

impossible using the existing information to lay down key

emission figures for the potato processing industry. Nor was

an acceptable odour nuisance level established during the

industry-wide investigation.

_Dispersion of odours_
For the potato processing industry no correlation was
established between the number of odour units and the

degree of nuisance. Nor have key emission figures been
established for the potato processing industry.
Calculation of the odour concentration in the

surrounding area is not possible on the basis of the key
emission figures found by the industry.

_Nuisance_

For the purpose of determining the nuisance level
caused by an operator the methods described in the
system used for classifying nuisance caused by odours
can be used. On the basis of the description of the type
of odour it is often possible to identify the source
which causes the nuisance. The type of odour is
indicated in Table , the list of sources.

**Enforcement under the actual conditions**

Where no limit values for odours have been established

enforcement of the obligation to implement emission

abatement measures must especially aim at the way the

operation is run, with a view to the nature of these

measures.

Under the actual conditions often measures have already be

taken at the steam peeler and installations for the

production of dry products because of other environment

related aspects such as noise and particulates. These

measures often at the same time reduce odour emissions.

_Measures_

In Table  the basic set of measures is indicated. In

addition to this, criteria are quoted next to each
measure which must be given due consideration. The
measures address the major sources.
In the event that the basic measures are not effective

enough at eliminating the nuisance, additional
measures will be necessary. Measures that can be
considered are, among other things, increasing the
height of the stack, installing biologically active filters,
installing scrubbers, and installing incineration.

**Table 1** **List of sources in the potato processing industry**

**Table 2** **Standard measures**

**Standard measures**

Cooling down fried products in many cases already takes

place under contained conditions. A number of locations

exist where cooling using air supplied from outdoors is still

practised. Demanding a measure under these conditions is

only reasonable in the event that a cooling tunnel is

receiving a major overhaul or is replaced altogether.

In addition to condensers, other technologies exist which

also result in an odour emission reduction, such as for

example scrubbers. Depending on the local situation, a

careful consideration of the options is indicated. The

efficiency achieved by these technologies is generally lower.

A condenser has the added advantage that part of the

energy can be re-used. The manner in which the condenser

is integrated into the production process may differ per

location. It depends (among other things) on the use that is

made of the heat which is recovered and the temperature of

the cooling water that is used. In addition to these factors, in

the end the product being fried also determines the

efficiency of the condenser. Under the actual conditions the

exit temperature can be lower than 85°C in the event that

the volume of steam is below the designed maximum. The

mass flow is determined by the fan speed.

**Extra measures**

For this branch of industry the rule applies that the standard

set of measures should be used as a default which, under

the actual conditions, may be adjusted by demanding more

stringent measures depending on the actual conditions at

the operator’s.

Depending on whether nuisance is still being caused and

the local conditions there may be occasion to demand extra

measures. In addition to the measures mentioned other extra

measures are also possible. In the case of extra measures

the efficiency at achieving environment protection aims must

be weighed against other aspects such as energy

consumption, safety and noise, to mention a few points.

In new situations such as newly established operations and/or

dwellings it is recommended to maintain sufficient distance

between the potato processing operation and the dwellings.

**B9** **Aromatics and flavourings**
**manufacturers**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in January ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Scope_
These regulations are applicable to all operators who
produce aromatics and/or flavourings.

**Industry-wide investigation**

The figures mentioned in these regulations are based for a

large part on the research document: ‘ _Categorie 1_

_onderzoek bij de Geur- en Smaakstoffenindustrie in het_

_kader van de Nota Stankbeleid_ (Category 1 research into

the aromatics and flavourings industry within the framework

of the Policy Document on Odours)’, TNO, January 1996,

R95-381.

**Scope**

Aromatics and flavourings are produced via basic

processing such as extraction and distillation of natural

products and by organic chemical reactions. The

regulations apply both in the case of a number of large

operators with a complex range of products and

installations, and in the case of smaller operators with a

limited product range that includes for example only

aromatics or only flavourings.

_Sources_

During the production of, and in handling aromatics
and flavourings, odour emissions occur at various
stages of the process. For a number of sub-processes
emission factors have been determined, based on
emission measurements at three of the major operators.

It concerns the following sub-processes:

- production of flavourings
- reaction/crystallisation
- extraction/distillation

- production of aromatics or fragrances

- mixing and weighing of liquid flavouring agents
(compounding)

- mixing and weighing of liquid fragrances
(compounding)

- spray drying processes

- compounding of powders

- treatment with water

- physical/chemical
- biological

- rinsing (cleaning drums/containers and bottles)

- various (storage and transhipment, processing of
waste).

**Calculation of the emission**

The total odour emission can be calculated by multiplying

the emission factor associated with each part of the process

with the throughput and subsequently adding up the results.

The total odour emission from large operators (more than

2000 tonnes production per year, approximately 6000

operating hours per year) amounts to (without emission

abatement measures) approximately 1.5 x 10 [9] ou E /hour.

For small operators producing 2000 tonnes/year during

2000 operational hours per year this is approximately

1.5 x 10 [7] ou E /hour.

_Nuisance_
An odour concentration level of . ou E /m [] as  [th]

percentile in the built-up areas or other objects
sensitive to odours involved may not be exceeded in
existing situations.
Where the odour concentration is between  and .
ou E /m [] as  [th] percentile and nuisance is being
reported the competent administrative body must
decide whether measures aimed at further reduction

are necessary. For assessing the situation, the system
used for classifying nuisance caused by odours (please
refer to §.) can be used.
Below a calculated odour concentration of  ou E /m [] as
 [th] percentile measures are not necessary. For
extensions to existing situations Best Available Control
Technology must be utilised.
For new situations  ou E /m [] as  [th] percentile must be
considered the maximum permissible immission

concentration.

**Nuisance level**

In the case of three operators measurements by ‘smelling

squads’ were performed. In the case of two out of three

operators the results of these measurements were correlated

to measured emission values. In the case of one operator the

results were correlated to calculated emission values.

From the research carried out by the ‘smelling squads’ it

transpired that the odours released during the manufacture of

flavourings are often described as ‘unpleasant’, even in the

case of low concentrations. The odours released during the

manufacture of aromatics is readily detected at low

concentrations but generally not characterised as unpleasant.

The measurements covered the entire range of products

produced by the industry. For this reason it has been

considered acceptable to base the acceptable nuisance

levels quoted in the main body of these Regulations, and

which apply to the entire branch of industry concerned, on

the arithmetic average of these measurement results.

In the report ‘ _Relatie geurbelasting en geurhinder bij de geur-_

_en smaakstoffenindustrie_ (Correlation between odour levels

and odour nuisance in the case of aromatics and flavourings

manufacturers)’, PRA, NEA96B1, May 1997, the current

state of affairs with respect to the correlation between odour

levels and odour nuisance is discussed. Chapter 3 of the

report mentioned in the text frame ‘Industry-wide

investigation’ has since lost its relevance.

_Implementation in phases_
If it is concluded on the basis of the nuisance reported
that an unacceptable nuisance situation exists it must
be investigated which sources are eligible for odour
emission reducing measures. To this end the total
odour output from the operation must be calculated
on the basis of relevant sources, production statistics
and key odour output figures. The sources of odours
must be identified and characterised for this purpose,
both in terms of the nature of the odours released and

of the emission pattern.
On the basis of details discovered about the emissions,
the local correlation with nuisance reports, potential
reductions and the required costs it will be decided on
the basis of  which measures must be

implemented.

_Measures_

Measures to limit odour emissions and odour nuisance

can be classified as organisational/preventive measures,
device specific odour reduction technologies and endof-pipe technologies.

_Organisational/preventive measures_
The discharge of odours can be limited by:

- use of enclosed process equipment;

- performing minor activities in which strong odours
are released in special areas (for example in fume
cupboard) in which an underpressure is maintained;

- keeping doors closed during operations;

- limiting or avoiding the production of certain
products under adverse weather conditions;

- the use of vapour return systems during draining and
filling of drums;

- the use of pumps with high quality seals or fully
closed systems;

- covering over of parts of the waste water treatment
plant;

- the use of fully closed systems for rinsing empty
feedstock containers.

_Device specific technologies (process integrated measures)_
It should be possible to employ simple device specific
technologies to limit emissions which reduce the
release of aromatics in the production areas. These
technologies are effectively part of the piece of process
equipment involved and they are also appropriate for
eliminating solvents or particulates from air flows.
Examples of such technologies are (cascaded)
condensers, scrubbers, carbon filters (exhaustion
directly at the source), and cyclones/bag filters (at the
exit of spray dryers, during compounding powders).

_End-of-pipe technologies for airflows extracted directly (at_
_the source) and indirectly (from production halls)_
For these processes various technologies are available.
The decision to opt for any particular technology
depends on the quantity and nature of the odour
components in the air flows. The approach through
end-of-pipe technology is based on extracting air flows
containing odours at the source as much as possible.

These small and relatively concentrated flows can be
treated in incinerators, biologically active filters or
using technologies with a similar efficiency.

Any emissions not extracted at the source will be
emitted via the ventilation air of the production areas.
The ventilation air of the production areas is
characterised by large mass flows and low
concentrations of odour components and can be
purified using biologically active filters or by means of
a disposable adsorbing agent. Another possibility is to
emit this stream of air via an elevated discharge point.

**Action plan and measures**

Due to the complex process operation, characterised by

rapid fluctuations in the odour level and odour

concentration, it is difficult to indicate a universally

applicable (set of) measure(s) that is relevant to all odour

related problems this type of operator may encounter. It will

be necessary to identify for each operator the most

significant sources of odours or nuisance (on the basis of

complaints records). By evaluating the potential

technologies it will be possible to take a well-balanced

decision regarding the measures that must be demanded.

Organisational and preventive measures should be among

those considered first.

Before end-of-pipe technology is applied to airflows

originating from area ventilation it must first be assessed- as

for any source of emissions - whether the emission can be

controlled through modification of the process at the source,

or at least can be concentrated to a small flow and then be

subjected to treatment.

The various waste gas flows released have been assessed

by TNO to determine which technologies are most

appropriate (Report on the industry wide investigation and

interim report entitled ‘ _Effectiviteit en kosten van mogelijke_

_geurimmissiereducerende maatregelen_ (Effectiveness and

cost of potential odour immission reducing measures)’,

TNO, 95-08841, November 1995). On the basis of the

characteristics most relevant for their cleaning the major

waste gas flows containing odours can be classified into

four types:

 - Type 1: process exhaustion and exhaustion at the source

in the case of the production of flavourings and the

compounding and weighing of liquid flavourings and

liquid aromas or fragrances;

 - Type 2: process integrated exhaustion and exhaustion at

the source in the case of the production of aromatics and

fragrances;

 - Type 3: process integrated exhaustion in the case of

spray drying equipment;

 - Type 4: exhaustion of ventilation air in production and

compounding/weighing areas.

Type 1 waste gas flows are characterised by a relatively

high odour concentration and a VOC content that may be

as high as 100 mg/m [3] . Cleaning using biologically active

filters is an effective technique, increasing the level of

discharge is cheaper but also less effective.

Type 2 waste gas flows are characterised by a relatively low

odour concentration and a relatively high VOC content.

Cleaning using biologically active filters is an effective

technique, increasing the level of discharge is cheaper but

also less effective.

Type 3 waste gas flows are characterised by a relatively

high odour concentration and a relatively low VOC content.

In addition to these, a number of high-temperature, humid

waste gas flows with a high particulate content fall into this

category. This means that a combination of particulate

removing techniques and odour limiting technologies is

indicated (scrubbing/cooling + cleaning using biologically

active filters or bag filters, followed by incinerating).

Type 4 waste gas flows are characterised by a relatively low

odour concentration and VOC content. For these emissions

cleaning using biologically active filters, adsorption (using

disposable agents) and increasing the level of discharge

can be considered.

Introducing cleaning using biologically active filters in the

case of flows exhausted directly at the source or as an

integral part of the process is an effective solution, and the

costs are reasonable.

**B10** **Breweries**

_These regulations were included in the NeR in February ._
_Unless specific requirements for emissions are explicitly_
_mentioned in the following, the general provisions of the_
_NeR will apply._

_Introduction_

The regulations aim to limit or prevent nuisance
caused by odours.

_Scope_
The regulations are applicable to breweries with an
average production of at least one brew daily.
The regulations make a distinction between large
breweries, where more than , hectolitres of beer
is brewed annually, and small breweries where less than
, hectolitres of beer is brewed.
The regulations are not applicable to maltings.
The regulations are not pertinent to waste water
treatment plants operated by breweries.

**Distinction between large and small breweries**

Very small breweries which produce less than one brew

daily are often combined with some other activity, like a bar

or catering establishment. The situation in that case is

strongly dependent on local factors and very specific. That

is why for this type of operation no rules of general

applicability are given here.

The distinction between small and large breweries on the

basis of their annual production, and the criterion of

200,000 hectolitres referred to, is based in excise tax

legislation.

The regulations do not specify requirements for waste water

treatment plants because a waste water treatment plant

which is well-dimensioned and operated in an expert

manner will normally not cause any odour nuisance. If

nuisance is being reported, though, the competent

authorities, following consultations with the operator, must

demand that measures be taken.

_Emissions_

There are four sources of odour emissions associated

with brewing operations that are relevant here. These
are: mashing, cooking the portion of the mash that
contains the adjuncts, cooking the wort and various
fugitive emissions. Fugitive emissions may result from
fermenting, maturing, filtering and bottling
operations.

To allow calculation of the odour emissions the

following _key figures_ have been established.

- mashing  Mou E /tonne of
ingredients loaded

- cooking the portion of the 
mash that contains the

adjuncts

- fugitive sources .

- cooking the wort 

**Key figures**

The key figures quoted were obtained during the research

into odours carried out under the authority of the brewers’

trade organisation ( _Bedrijfstakonderzoek geurproblematiek_

_brouwindustrie_ (Industry-wide investigation into odour

related problems associated with breweries), Witteveen and

Bos, 1995).

These figures were verified by recent measurements. The

key figures and emission values quoted are relevant for

brewing Pilsener-type beer (lager). They may also be used in

cases where specialty beers/ales are brewed, provided that

such brews constitute only a limited portion of the total

production. If specialty beers/ales make up more than

several tenths of per cent of the total production, the

competent authorities must assess whether it is necessary to

use non-standard key figures in determining the emission of

odours. Especially in the case of mashing other values may

need to be used where specialty beers/ales are involved.

The key figure for the level of the fugitive emissions has been

determined on the basis of a transition point percentage of

2.5% of the emission resulting from cooking the wort.

**Nuisance**

_Large breweries_
For breweries with a capacity of more than ,
hectolitres per annum the following requirements to
prevent odour nuisance must be met:

_New situations_

In new situations the odour concentration near objects
sensitive to odour nuisance may not exceed . ou E /m []

as  [th] percentile (hourly values averaged over one
year).

**Odour concentration in new situations**

In the course of several polls on nuisance levels around

breweries it was found that odour nuisance caused by

breweries occurs in the case of odour concentrations above

1 to 1.5 European odour units per m [3] as 98 [th] percentile. In

lab tests researching the nuisance associated with odours

produced by breweries, an odour concentration value of

1.35 to 3 European odour units was established as the

threshold where nuisance may occur.

The limit value in the case of new situations has therefore

been set at 1.5 European odour units.

_Existing situations_
If due to an existing large brewery the _odour_
_concentration_ in densely populated residential areas
amounts to more than . European odour units
per m [] as  [th] percentile ( _hourly values_ averaged over
one year) then measures must be taken in the form of
condensation or vapour re-compression of the cooking
vapours from the wort kettle, or of a similar measure
with an efficiency of reducing odours of at least %.

**Odour concentrations in existing situations**

In existing situations dwellings often lie at very small

distances from breweries. In these cases an immission

concentration of 1.5 ou E /m [3] as 98 [th] percentile is generally

not achievable in the case of the dwellings lying

immediately next to the brewery. For this reason this

concentration has not been used as a limit value for existing

situations. For existing situations the immission level of

1.5 ou E /m [3] is set as a warning threshold level. If the odour

concentration exceeds this value the measures mentioned

must be taken.

This warning threshold level is not checked in the dwelling

lying immediately next to the brewery, but in the nearest

densely populated residential area. The competent authorities

must determine the relevant immission point. This provision is

included in order to take into account the technical options

available to breweries for limiting emissions and the historic

developments of existing situations.

_Small breweries_

Both in the case of new and of existing breweries the
odour emissions must be limited by implementing
measures in accordance with Best Available Control

Technology for small breweries.

**Hourly average values**

The hourly average values of the odour concentration must

be calculated using the applicable dispersion model. In this

context it must be taken into account that there may be

complicating effects due to a potential influence exerted by

landscape features (in hilly country).

In calculating immission contour lines any increase in the

actual discharge level due to the heat contents of the

discharged vapours must be taken into account.

In assessing the situation it is important to also take into

account short-lasting peaks in the odour emissions, in

particular during cooking operations, as these may easily

cause a nuisance situation to be subjectively perceived.

**Measures**

_Large breweries_
The discharge originating from the major source, the
boiling process, can be reduced by means of
condensation of the vapours or vapour re-compression.
Emission reductions of at least % can be achieved for
odours.

The emissions from fugitive sources can be controlled
by measures targeted at good housekeeping.
In addition, it is possible to limit the odour
concentration in residential areas by demanding similar
measures that have the same effect.

**Measures for large breweries**

The key emission abatement measure is collecting the

vapours which are released in cooking the wort. For this,

condensation of the vapours or vapour re-compression can

be utilised, or a combination of both technologies.

Condensation of the vapours and vapour re-compression

may be considered as Best Available Control Technology in

the case of large breweries. Both can reduce the discharge

of odours due to cooking the wort by at least 85%.

Both measures extract heat from the cooking vapours. This

heat in many situations can be made available for the

brewing process. By cooling down the cooking vapours a

large part of the aromatics in the waste gases will

condense. This reduces the emission of odours considerably.

In the case of a condenser a small residual continuous waste

gas flow may remain, which still contains part of the

aromatic constituents. In the case of vapour re-compression

the brewing kettle remains closed during the greater part of

the cooking process. Under these conditions no emissions

occur at all. However, for a short time at the beginning of

the process the kettle is open. At that time there will be a

short-lasting, but untreated emission.

Both measures have a favourable effect on the energy

balance of the wort cooking process. For many large

breweries the rule applies that the measures will pay for

themselves through the energy savings gained. The

investments recovery time depends on the specific situation.

More drastic measures aimed at reduction of odour

emissions are the following end-of-pipe technologies:

 - biological waste gas treatment facilities/scrubbers;

 - biologically active filters;

 - oxidation of certain odour components using active

oxygen;

 - adsorption systems employing active carbon or zeolite;

 - incineration.

Incineration will have disadvantages in the area of energy

consumption if the heat generated cannot be used

effectively elsewhere. This means that this particular

measure under those specific circumstances will be at odds

with the general policy promoting energy efficiency.

The feasibility of using these measures in the case of

brewing kettles has not been established yet so that these

measures cannot be considered Best Available Control

Technology for breweries at this moment in time. When

evaluation of the regulations is done this will be assessed.

_Small breweries_

In the case of small breweries the odour concentration

at immission level must be limited by implementing
measures according to Best Available Control
Technology (listed below), by practising good
housekeeping, by keeping closed the doors and other
openings of installations and production halls must be
kept closed. The odour concentration at immission
level can also be limited by increasing the level at which
vapours from the wort kettle are vented.

Measures according to Best Available Control
Technology for small breweries include the following:

- Keeping doors and windows of the brewery closed;

- Keeping the brewer’s grains basins covered;

- Regularly cleaning of the brewer’s grains silo;

- Limiting the emissions discharged during the
fermenting and lagering stages by installing a
scrubber to absorb the odour producing components
from the carbon dioxide before it is vented to the

atmosphere;

- Storing yeast cultures (whether for re-use or disposal)
in fully closed tanks;

- Implementing the combination filter (diatomaceous
earth and sterilising plates) as a fully closed system
(contained conditions);

- Keeping the covers of the rotapool, the brewing
kettle and the clarification tank closed;

- Keeping the storage area for spent diatomaceous
earth covered over;

- Implementing the sewer system as a fully closed

system;

- Filling any cracks or seams in the buildings
containing installations.

**Measures for small breweries**

If dwellings are located within a short distance from a small

brewery and odour nuisance is being reported, measures

can be demanded in the area of good housekeeping in

order to reduce the discharge of odours from fugitive

sources, or a stack can be required in order to reduce the

immission concentration in the residential areas.

The distinction between measures for large breweries and

measures for small breweries has been made because in the

case of large breweries the investments in emission

abatement measures, due to their favourable effect on the

energy consumption, can usually be recovered in due time.

For small breweries the investments recovery time is

considerably longer than in the case of large breweries,

especially due to the relatively great costs.

_Compliance deadlines and evaluation_
For existing situations a compliance deadline of five
years after the inclusion of the present Special
Regulations in the NeR applies. For new situations the
requirements are applicable as of the commissioning of
the facility.
Five years after the inclusion of these Special
Regulations in the NeR an evaluation will take place.
This will focus on fixing the immission levels which
can be demanded in existing situations and on the
performance of the emission limiting technologies
mentioned above, both as regards their odour limiting
effect and their efficacy at promoting energy savings.

,

**Evaluation**

The measures mentioned have already been implemented at

various installations with a view to recouping energy.

Applications specifically targeted at reducing odour

emissions are relatively new. As the effectiveness under the

actual conditions is not really known yet the provision is

included here that in five years’ time an evaluation of these

Special Regulations will take place. This evaluation will

focus on fixing the immission levels which can be demanded

in existing situations and on establishing the performance

levels that can be expected of the emission limiting

technologies mentioned above, both as regards their odour

limiting effect and their efficacy at promoting energy

savings, and on the efficacy and possibilities for demanding

implementation of the end-of-pipe technologies referred to

above.
