#### TRANSFORMERLESS CENTRAL INVERTERS WITH A SINGLE POWER BLOCK www.ingeteam.com

solar.energy@ingeteam.com

# SUN

### Up to 1800 kVA at 1500 V

**Maximum power density**
These PV central inverters feature more pow­
er per cubic foot. Thanks to the use of highquality components, this inverter series per­
forms at the highest possible level.

**Latest generation electronics**
The B Series inverters integrate an innovative
control unit that runs faster and performs a
more efficient and sophisticated inverter con­
trol, as it uses a last-generation digital sig­
nal processor. Furthermore, the hardware of
the control unit allows some more accurate

measurements and very reliable protections.

These inverters feature a low voltage ridethrough capability and also a lower power
consumption thanks to a more efficient power
supply electronic board.

**Improved AC connection**
The output connection has been designed in
order to facilitate a direct close-coupled con­
nection with the MV transformer.

### PowerMax B Series

1,500 V dc

**Maximum protection**
These three phase inverters are equipped
with a motorized DC switch to decouple the
PV generator from the inverter. Moreover,
they are also supplied with a motorized AC
circuit breaker. Optionally, they can be sup­
plied with DC fuses, smart grounding kit and
input current monitoring.

**Maximum efficiency values**
Through the use of innovative electronic con­
version topologies, efficiency values of up to
98.9% can be achieved. Thanks to a sophis­
ticated control algorithm, this equipment can
guarantee maximum efficiency depending on
the PV power available.

**Enhanced functionality**
This new INGECON [®] SUN PowerMax range
features a revamped, improved enclosure
which, together with its innovative air cooling
system, makes it possible to increase the am­
bient operating temperature.

Up to 1800 kVA at 1500 V

**Long-lasting design**
The inverters have been designed to
guarantee a long life expectancy, as
demonstrated by the stress tests they are
subjected to. Standard 5 year warranty,
extendable for up to 25 years.

**Grid support**
The INGECON [® ] SUN PowerMax B Series

has been designed to comply with the
grid connection requirements in different
countries, contributing to the quality and
stability of the electric system. These
inverters therefore feature a low voltage
ride-through capability, and can deliver
reactive power and control the active
power delivered to the grid. Moreover,

PROTECTIONS

DC Reverse polarity.

Short-circuits and overloads at the output.

Anti-islanding with automatic disconnection.

Insulation failure DC.

Up to 15 pairs of fuse-holders.

Lightning induced DC and AC surge arresters,
type II.

Motorized DC switch to automatically
disconnect the inverter from the PV array.

Motorized AC circuit breaker.

Low-voltage ride-through capability.

Hardware protection via firmware.

Additional protection for the power stack, as
it is air-cooled by a closed loop.

they can operate in weak power grids
with a low short-circuit ratio (SCR).

**Ease of maintenance**

All the elements can be removed or re­
placed directly from the inverter’s front
side, thanks to its new design.

**Easy to operate**
The INGECON [® ] SUN PowerMax inver
ters feature an LCD screen for the simple
and convenient monitoring of the inverter
status and a range of internal variables.

The display also includes a number of
LEDs to show the inverter operating sta­
tus with warning lights to indicate any
incidents. All this helps to simplify and
facilitate maintenance tasks.

OPTIONAL ACCESSORIES

Insulation failure AC.

Grounding kit.

Heating kit, for operating at an ambient
temperature of down to -30 oC.

Lightning induced DC surge arresters,
type I+II.

DC fuses.

Monitoring of the DC currents.

Sand trap kit.

Wattmeter on the AC side.

PID prevention kit
(PID: Potential Induced Degradation).

Nighttime reactive power injection.

Integrated DC combiner box.

PowerMax B Series 1,500 V dc

**Monitoring and communication**
Ethernet communications supplied
as standard. The following applica­
tions are included at no extra cost:
INGECON [®] SUN Manager, INGECON [®]
SUN Monitor and its Smartphone ver­
sion Web Monitor, available on the App
Store. These applications are used for
monitoring and recording the inverter’s
internal operating variables through the
Internet (alarms, real time production,
etc.), in addition to the historical produc­
tion data.

Two communication ports available (one
for monitoring and one for plant con­
trolling), allowing fast and simultaneous
plant control.

ADVANTAGES OF THE B SERIES

Higher power density.

Latest generation electronics.

More efficient electronic protection.

Night time supply to communicate with
the inverter at night.

Enhanced performance.

Easier maintenance thanks to its new
design and enclosure.

Lightweight spares.

It allows to ground the PV array.

Components easily replaceable.
