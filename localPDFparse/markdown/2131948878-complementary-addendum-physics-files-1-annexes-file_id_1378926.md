  - C concentrations. A recent assessment of Cd under
-->

admium (Cd) is a nonessential trace element that
can be toxic to aquatic biota at elevated
# C concentrations. A recent assessment of Cd under

the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA)
indicated that dissolved and soluble forms of inorganic Cd
are entering the Canadian environment in quantities
or concentrations, or under conditions, that are having,
or may have, a harmful effect on the environment
(Government of Canada 1994). Cadmium enters aquatic
systems through aerial deposition or runoff and
accumulates in bed sediments by association with
particulate matter, such as organic matter and iron and
manganese hydroxides, or by precipitating out of solution
with carbonate or sulphide (Landrum and Robbins 1990;
Burton 1992). Sediments, therefore, act as an important
route of exposure for aquatic organisms. Canadian interim
sediment quality guidelines (ISQGs) and probable effect
levels (PELs) for Cd can be used to evaluate the degree to
which adverse biological effects are likely to occur as a
result of exposure to Cd in sediments.

Canadian ISQGs and PELs for Cd were developed using a
modification of the National Status and Trends Program
approach as described in CCME (1995) (Table 1). The
ISQGs and PELs refer to total concentrations of Cd in
surficial sediments (i.e., top 5 cm), as quantified by
digestion with a strong acid (e.g., aqua regia, nitric acid,
or hydrochloric acid) followed with determination by a
standard analytical protocol.

The majority of the data used to derive ISQGs and PELs
for Cd are from studies on field-collected sediments that
measured concentrations of Cd, along with concentrations
of other chemicals, and associated biological effects, as
compiled in the Biological Effects Database for Sediments
(BEDS) (Environment Canada 1997). The Cd data sets for
freshwater and marine sediments are large, with the
freshwater data set containing 86 effect entries and
363 no-effect entries and the marine data set containing
107 effect entries and 326 no-effect entries (Figures 1
and 2). The BEDS represents a wide range of
concentrations, types of sediment, and mixtures of
chemicals. Evaluation of the percentage of effect entries
for Cd that are below the ISQGs, between the ISQGs and
the PELs, and above the PELs (Figures 1 and 2) indicates
that these values define three ranges of chemical
concentrations: those that are rarely, occasionally, and
frequently associated with adverse biological effects,
respectively (Environment Canada 1997).

**Toxicity**

Adverse biological effects for Cd in the BEDS include
decreased benthic invertebrate abundance, increased
mortality, and behavioural changes, among others
(Environment Canada 1997, Appendixes IIa and IIb). For
example, the relatively sensitive taxa Ephemeroptera,
Plecoptera, and Tricoptera were less abundant in Penetang
Harbour (Lake Huron, Ontario), where the mean

$
concentration of Cd was 0.77 mg kg [-1], which is above the
freshwater ISQG, compared to sites with concentrations of

$
0.38 mg kg [-1] Cd (Jaagumagi 1988). Similarly, increased
mortality, decreased reburial, and increased emergence
were observed in _Lepidactylus dytiscus_, an amphipod
(Hall et al. 1992). In the lab, the test organisms were
exposed for a 10- and 20-d period to estuarine sediments
(Chesapeake Bay, U.S.A.) that contained a mean

$
concentration of Cd of 1.6 mg kg [-1], which is above the
marine ISQG (Hall et al. 1992). In this study, sediments

$
containing <0.2 mg kg [-1] Cd, which is below the marine
ISQG, did not induce adverse biological effects in this
species.

Spiked-sediment toxicity tests for Cd report the onset of
toxicity to benthic organisms at higher concentrations than
those observed in field studies. This is likely a result of
the shorter exposure times of these laboratory studies, as
well as exposure to Cd only, as opposed to chemical
mixtures containing Cd (Environment Canada 1997). For
example, 10-d LC 50 s for _Rhepoxynius abronius_, a marine
amphipod, ranged from 6.9 to 11.5 mg·kg [-1] (Swartz et al.
1985; Mearns et al. 1986; Ott 1986; Robinson et al.
1988), which is close to the marine PEL of 4.2 mg·kg [-1] .

Further, Di Toro et al. (1990) demonstrated a protective
effect of high concentrations of acid volatile sulphide
(AVS). In this study, it was shown that the 10-d LC 50 s
for _Rhepoxynius_ _hudsoni_ and _Ampelisca abdita_ were

approximately 50 and 500 times higher, respectively, than
the marine PEL.

Sublethal effects of Cd to marine organisms in spikedsediment toxicity tests include effects on emergence and
reburial of _R. abronius_ at concentrations ranging from 6.5
to 16.2 mg·kg [-1], which is just above the marine PEL
(Swartz et al. 1985; Mearns et al. 1986). Sediment
avoidance was also observed when _Rhepoxynius_ spp. and
_Eohaustorius_ _sencillus_ were exposed to similar
concentrations (Oakden et al. 1984a, 1984b). In contrast,
the times and rates of burrowing for three species of
polychaete worms and the feeding behaviour of one of
those species (i.e., _Glycera dibranciata_ ), were unaffected
after 28-d exposure to concentrations of Cd that were
10 times the marine PEL (Olla et al. 1988).

In freshwater spiked-sediment toxicity tests, reproduction
of the burrowing oligochaete worm _Tubifex tubifex_ was
adversely affected when the concentration of Cd (i.e.,
12 mg·kg [-1] ) was greater than the freshwater PEL and the
total organic carbon (TOC) content was 1%. At similar
concentrations of Cd, but with a TOC content of 12%, no
adverse effects were observed (Day et al. 1994). These
results suggest that organic matter may modify the toxicity
of Cd to freshwater benthic organisms. Other freshwater
spiked-sediment toxicity tests did not demonstrate adverse
effects of Cd at concentrations known to occur in aquatic
environments (Environment Canada 1997).

Results of both marine and freshwater spiked-sediment
toxicity tests indicate that concentrations of Cd that are
associated with adverse effects are consistently above the
ISQGs, confirming that these guidelines represent
concentrations below which adverse biological effects will
rarely occur. Furthermore, these studies provide additional
evidence that toxic levels of Cd in sediments are similar to
the PELs, confirming that adverse effects are more likely
to be observed when concentrations of Cd exceed the
PELs. The ISQGs and PELs for Cd are therefore expected
to be valuable tools for assessing the ecotoxicological
relevance of concentrations of Cd in sediments.

**Concentrations**

Concentrations of Cd in marine and freshwater sediments
vary substantially across Canada (Environment Canada
1997). In the National Geochemical Reconnaissance
(NGR) program database by the Geological Survey of
Canada (GSC) (Friske and Hornbrook 1991), the mean
background concentrations in Canadian lake and stream
sediments are 0.32 mg·kg [-1] and 0.63 mg·kg [-1], respectively
(P.W.B. Friske 1996, GSC, Ottawa, pers. com.). A
comparison of the background concentrations in the
combined lake and stream NGR database (n = 78 735) to

the freshwater ISQG and PEL reveals that the ISQG and
the PEL for Cd fall at the 82nd and 98.25th percentiles,
respectively (R.G. Garrett 1997, GSC, Ottawa, pers.
com.). This demonstrates that background concentrations
of Cd across most of Canada are lower than the freshwater
ISQG of 0.6 mg·kg [-1] . In marine systems, mean
background concentrations of Cd, estimated from deep
layers of sediment cores (>10 cm) from a variety of
published sources, ranged from 0.16 mg·kg [-1 ] to
4.24 mg·kg [-1] (i.e., well below the marine ISQG to just
above the marine PEL) (Environment Canada 1997).

Concentrations of Cd in surficial sediments located close
to point sources of contamination frequently exceed
estimates of background concentrations (Environment
Canada 1997). For example, concentrations in sediments
as high as 19.8 mg·kg [-1] have been measured in marine
harbours receiving various industrial inputs and as high as
235 mg·kg [-1] in freshwater lakes near mining and smelting
operations (Environment Canada 1997).

**Additional Considerations**

Regardless of the origin of Cd in sediments, aquatic
organisms may be adversely affected by exposure to
elevated levels. The occurrence of adverse biological
effects cannot be precisely predicted from concentration
data alone, particularly in the concentration ranges
between the ISQGs and PELs (Figures 1 and 2). The
incidence of adverse biological effects in response to Cd
exposure is site-specific. Site-specific factors that
influence bioavailability include the sensitivity of
individual species, the endpoints examined, as well as a
variety of physicochemical (e.g., pH, redox potential, and
particle size), biological (e.g., feeding behaviour and
uptake rates), and geochemical (e.g., organic matter and
sulphide levels) factors (Environment Canada 1997).

Benthic organisms are exposed to particulate and
dissolved Cd in interstitial and overlying waters and to
sediment-bound Cd through surface contact and sediment
ingestion. However, the dissolved forms of Cd are
believed to be the most readily bioavailable (Loring and
Prosi 1986). Cadmium associated with sediment fractions
that exhibit cation-exchange capacity or that are easily
reduced is generally more bioavailable than that
associated with other fractions (Environment Canada
1997). Cadmium associated with other sediment phases,
such as inorganic solid phases, organic matter, and oxides
of iron and manganese, may become bioavailable as a
result of changes in ambient environmental conditions that
affect the distribution of Cd between dissolved and
particulate phases (e.g., sediment turbation, decrease in
pH, and increase in redox potential). In contrast, Cd that is
bound within the crystalline lattices of clay and some

other minerals that are associated with acid-extractable or
residual sediment fractions is generally considered to be
the least bioavailable. Once Cd is ingested, its
bioavailabilty depends on various factors, including
enzyme activity and gut pH (Environment Canada 1997).

Recently, the role of AVS in modifying Cd bioavailability
in anoxic sediments has received substantial attention. A
model has been proposed to predict the absence of
cationic trace metal bioavailability (and hence toxicity)
when the molar ratio of simultaneously extractable metals
(SEM), including Cd, to AVS in sediments is <1 (or when
the difference is <0) due to complexation of metals with
available sulphide (Di Toro et al. 1990; MacDonald and
Salazar 1995). Although laboratory studies provide
evidence for a lack of bioavailability of Cd when the
SEM/AVS ratio in sediment is <1, several limitations
exist in the model’s applicability to predicting the
bioavailability of Cd in the field (Hare et al. 1994;
Leonard et al. 1995; Environment Canada 1997).
However, the role of AVS and other factors that modify
the bioavailability of Cd should be considered, along with
the recommended ISQGs and PELs, in site-specific
assessments of Cd in sediments.

Currently, the degree to which Cd will be bioavailable at
particular sites cannot be predicted conclusively from the
physicochemical characteristics of the sediments or the
attributes of endemic organisms (Environment Canada
1997). Nonetheless, the incidence of adverse biological
effects associated with exposure to Cd increases as
concentrations of Cd increase in a range of sediment types
(Figures 1 and 2). Therefore, the recommended Canadian
ISQGs and PELs for Cd will be useful in assessing the
ecotoxicological significance of Cd in sediments.
