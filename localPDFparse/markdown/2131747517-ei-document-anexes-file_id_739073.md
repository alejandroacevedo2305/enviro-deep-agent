**SpectrAlert Advance** offers the broadest line of outdoor horns,

strobes, and horn strobes in the industry. With white or red plastic

housings, wall or ceiling mounting options, and plain or FIRE-printed

devices, SpectrAlert Advance can meet virtually any application

requirement, including indoor, outdoor, wet, and dry applications in

temperatures from −40°F to 151°F.

Like the entire SpectrAlert Advance line, outdoor horns, strobes,

and horn strobes for wall applications include a variety of features
that increase application flexibility and simplify installation. First,
field-selectable settings, including candela, automatic selection of

12- or 24-volt operation, horn tones, and three volume options enable

installers to easily adapt devices to meet requirements.

Next, SpectrAlert Advance devices use a universal mounting plate

for both wall and ceiling applications. This mounting plate includes

an onboard shorting spring that ensures wiring continuity before

devices are installed, so installers can verify proper wiring without

mounting the devices and exposing them to potential construction

damage. Once the plates are mounted, all SpectrAlert Advance

devices utilize a plug-in design with a single captured screw to

speed installation and virtually eliminate costly ground faults.

Outdoor devices ship with weatherproof plastic back boxes (metal

back boxes are available separately) that accommodate in-and
out wiring for daisy chaining devices. Plastic back boxes feature
removable side flanges and improved resistance to saltwater

corrosion. Knock-outs located on the back eliminate the need to drill

holes for screw-in mounting. Plastic and metal weatherproof back

boxes come with 3⁄4‐inch top and bottom conduit entries and 3⁄4‐inch

knock-outs at the back. A screw-in NPT plug with an O-ring gasket

for a watertight seal is included with each back box.

**SpectrAlert Advance Outdoor Horn, Strobe, and Horn Strobe Specifications**

**Architect/Engineer Specifications**

**General**

SpectrAlert Advance outdoor horns, strobes, and horn strobes shall mount to a weatherproof back box. A universal mounting plate shall
be used for mounting ceiling and wall products. The notification appliance circuit wiring shall terminate at the universal mounting plate.
Also, SpectrAlert Advance products, when used with the Sync•Circuit [TM] Module accessory, shall be powered from a non-coded notification
appliance circuit output and shall operate on a nominal 12 or 24 volts. When used with the Sync•Circuit Module, 12-volt-rated notification
appliance circuit outputs shall operate between 9 and 17.5 volts; 24-volt-rated notification appliance circuit outputs shall operate between 17
and 33 volts. Outdoor SpectrAlert Advance products shall operate between −40 and 151 degrees Fahrenheit from a regulated DC or full-wave
rectified unfiltered power supply. Strobes and horn strobes shall have field-selectable candela settings including 15, 15/75, 30, 75, 95, 110,
115, 135, 150, 177, and 185.

**Strobe**
The strobe shall be a System Sensor SpectrAlert Advance Model _______ listed to UL 1971 and shall be approved for fire protective service.
The strobe shall be wired as a primary-signaling notification appliance and comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements for
visible signaling appliances, flashing at 1 Hz over the strobe’s entire operating voltage range. The strobe light shall consist of a xenon flash
tube and associated lens/reflector system. The strobe must be installed with its weatherproof back box in order to remain outdoor approved
per UL. The strobe shall be suitable for use in wet environments.

**Horn Strobe Combination**

The horn strobe shall be a System Sensor SpectrAlert Advance Model _______ listed to UL 1971 and UL 464 and shall be approved for
fire protective service. The horn strobe shall be wired as a primary-signaling notification appliance and comply with the Americans with
Disabilities Act requirements for visible signaling appliances, flashing at 1 Hz over the strobe’s entire operating voltage range. The strobe
light shall consist of a xenon flash tube and associated lens/reflector system. The horn shall have three audibility options and an option to
switch between a temporal three pattern and a non-temporal (continuous) pattern. These options shall be set by a multiple position switch.
On four-wire products, the strobe shall be powered independently of the sounder. The horn or horn strobe models shall operate on a coded or
non-coded power supply. The horn strobe must be installed with its weatherproof back box in order to remain outdoor approved per UL. The
horn strobe shall be suitable for use in wet environments.
