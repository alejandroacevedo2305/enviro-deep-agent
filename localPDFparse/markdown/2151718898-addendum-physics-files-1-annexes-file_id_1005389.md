 - Shallow Flow Measurement in
Small and Large Channels

Configurable

The Teledyne Isco Environmental Network --TIENet® -- is key to the Signature flow meter’s flexibility. The Signature supports

multiple TIENet devices to monitor one or more channels with multiple, redundant, or alternate technologies, without

hardware or firmware changes. This network’s intelligent design minimizes cabling and conduit costs through the use of TIENet

expansion boxes, common connectors, and efficient cable configurations.

In addition to TIENet devices, the Signature also accepts SDI-12 and Modbus ASCII/RTU inputs.

Simplified Plant Integration

Acting as a system hub, the Signature records and transmits data, generates reports, and takes intelligent action in response

to multiple simultaneous inputs, communicating with SCADA systems using RS-485 Modbus ASCII or RTU, or optional 4-20 mA

Analog. With a diverse array of possible inputs and an industry-standard output, the Signature is a one-stop access point for process

monitoring and control.

SIGNATURE

FLOW METER

**Non-contact LaserFlowTM Velocity Sensor**

The LaserFlow sensor remotely

measures flow in open channels with

non-contact Laser Doppler Velocity

**Flow Technologies**

Designed with a variety of flow measurement options, the Signature has
the flexibility to meet challenging site requirements head-on. Choose
from four established flow measurement technologies.

The Signature flow meter can employ any combination of these

technologies simultaneously, even at great distances.

**Continuous-wave Doppler**

Teledyne Isco’s TIENetTM 350 Area

Velocity Sensor continuously

transmits an ultrasonic signal into the

technology and non-contact ultrasonic

level technology. The sensor uses

advanced technology to measure

|Col1|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|||The L<br>meas<br>non-<br>tech<br>level<br>adva|

velocity with a laser beam at single

or multiple points below the surface of the water. A non

contacting ultrasonic transmitter measures the liquid head

height to determine the wetted area. Multiplying the wetted

area by the average velocity yields the flow rate. Flow during

surcharge conditions can be measured with an optional,

integrally-mounted continuous-wave Doppler area velocity

sensor.

**Non-contact**

**Ultrasonic**

With the Teledyne Isco TIENetTM 310

Ultrasonic Level Sensor moun ~~te~~ d

above the flow stream, transmitted

sound pulses are reflected off the liquid

surface. The elapsed time between

transmitted and returned signals determines liquid level. Flow

rate is then calculated using one of the meter’s built-in flow

conversions, or a user-defined level-to-flow relationship.

flow stream. The signals are reflected

off bubbles and particles, and then

return to the sensor with a frequency

shift (Doppler effect) which is proportional to velocity. A

differential pressure transducer in the sensor measures liquid

depth in order to determine the wetted area. Flow rate is then

calculated by multiplying the wetted area of the flow stream by

its average velocity.

**Bubbler Module**

Teledyne Isco’s TIENetTM 330 Bubbler

Module technology is ideal in flow

streams affected by harsh weather,

debris, or corrosive chemicals. Since

the depth of flow is determined by

measuring the pressure needed to

force bubbles out of the line, you are able to calculate flow rate

using one of the meter’s built-in flow conversions, or a user
defined level-to-flow relationship.

1. Use with caution on small flumes
2. There must be adequate space above for mounting sensor
3. Large air temperature fluctuations will affect accuracy

4. Conditions that limit access to the water level may adversely affect

measurement
5. Non free flow conditions may require programming adjustments

Outputs and Communication

The Signature can export selected data in the industry format of choice to

associated equipment for remote data acquisition and/or process control.

The Signature’s ability to communicate over great distances using a number of

protocols makes it a powerful tool for smart triggering, alarming, reporting, and

data infrastructure.

**Modbus Output**

Simplified Plant Integration - The Signature communicates with SCADA systems

using RS-485 Modbus ASCII/RTU output.

**4-20 mA Current Loop**

Optional dual Analog Output cards support up to six independent 4-20 mA

current loops for external control. Additional outputs are possible with an

Expansion Box.

**Sampler Interface**

The TIENet 306 Sampler Interface connects the Signature to an automatic

wastewater sampler. The Signature can then enable the sampler based on user
specified conditions, (threshold, logic and equation) pace the sampling routine

based on flow, and receive sample and bottle information from the Teledyne Isco

sampler.

**USB Connectivity**

USB connectivity allows easy retrieval of report files via the front panel USB port

with a flash drive, or a direct Windows® PC connection. Report files may be viewed

as a text file or imported into Teledyne Isco’s Flowlink® software. USB connectivity

can also be used to save or load program settings and update firmware.

**Ethernet**

An Ethernet card provides remote retrieval of data and summary reports, remote

programming, and alarming via SMS text messaging or email.

**Cellular**

An internal CDMA or GSM cellular modem enables long distance, remote

programming, data retrieval, and alarms. Data can be automatically sent to server

at set time intervals.

**SCADA**

The Signature provides a Modbus output for exporting site data to an external

control system.

Intelligent Compliant

The Signature responds intelligently to multiple concurrent inputs,

with preprogrammed actions.

**Actions**

- Trigger and pace an automatic water sampler based on site
conditions, with the optional TIENet 306 Sampler Interface

- Log or push data at more frequent intervals during critical events
to capture higher-resolution data, returning to the primary rate
during normal operating conditions

- Switch from one flow measurement technology to another based
on site conditions

- Send alarm notifications via SMS text messaging or email

- Humidity alarms for preventive maintenance

The Signature secures the integrity of your site data
through verifiable reports with data authentication for

regulatory agencies.

**Reports**

Digital reports are accessible through the many

communication options, eliminating the expense of hard

copy report storage and paper roll/ribbon servicing.

Report types include:

 - Summary - Includes the daily minimum, maximum,
and average for selected data types

 - Diagnostic - Tracks all diagnostic tests and results
to ensure data quality. This can be useful in
analyzing site or application issues

 - Program - Contains the current configuration and
tracks any changes

 - History - Contains all user and meter events
such as data transfers, program changes, and
level adjustments. This information can be used
to confirm equipment operation and detect

**Original and Authentic--Verified!**
Use the free Report Verification tool installed alongside

Flowlink on your computer to verify data integrity. All

downloaded Signature data is accompanied by a singular

key calculated with a hash-based message authentication

code (HMAC). Even the slightest change to your data will
result in a drastically different key.

**USB Connectivity**
With a USB flash drive attached, you can quickly download

Diagnostic, Program, History, and Summary reports, update
firmware in the Signature flow meter and connected TIENet
devices, and download data files for use with

Flowlink software.

In addition, the USB port provides direct serial connection

with a computer running Flowlink.
