lssuing lab certifies that the instrument described above meets or exceeds all specifications as stated in the referenced procedure
(unless otherwise noted). lt has been calibrated using measurement standards traceable to the lnternational System of Units (Sl)
through the National lnstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST), or other national measurement institutes, and meets the
requirements of ISO/I EC 17 025:2005.
Test points marked with a t in the uncertainties column do not fall within this laboratory's scope of accreditation.

The quality system is registered to ISO 9001:2008.

This calibration is a direct comparison of the unit under test to the listed reference standards and did not involve any sampling plans to
complete. No allowance has been made for the instability of the test device due to use, time, etc. Such allowances would be made by
the customer as needed.

The uncerta¡nties were computed in accordance with the ISO Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). A
coverage factor of approximately 2 sigma (k=2) has been applied to the standard uncertainty to express the expanded uncertainty at
approx¡mately 95% confidence level.

This report may not be reproduced, except in full, unless permission for the publication of an approved abstract is obtained in writing
from the organization issuing th¡s report.

For 114" microphones, the Larson Davis ADP024 114" lo l12" adaptor is used with the calibrators and the Larson Davis ADp043 1/4" to
112" adaplor is used with the preamplifier.

The sound level meter submitted for testing successfully completed the periodic tests of IEC 6'1672-3:2013 / ANSI/AS A Sj .4-2014part
3, for the environmental conditions under which the tests were performed. However, no general statement or conclusion can be made
about conformance of the sound level meter to the full specifications of IEC 61672-1:2013 / ANSI/AS A 51 .4-201Atpart 1 because (a)
evidence was not publicly available, from an independent testing organization responsible for pattern approvals, to demonstrate that
the model of sound level meter fully conformed to the class 2 specifications in IEC 61672-1:2013 / ANSIiASA S'l .4-2014lpart 1 or
correction data for acoustical test of frequency weighting were not provided in the lnstruction Manual and (b) because the periodic tests
of IEC 61672-3:2013 / ANSIiASA S1.4-2014lPart 3 cover only a limited subset of the specifications in IEC 61672-1:2013 / ANSI/ASA
