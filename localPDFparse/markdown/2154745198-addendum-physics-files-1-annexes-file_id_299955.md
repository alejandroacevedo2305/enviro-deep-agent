# Explanatory notes to Product Data Sheets (PDS)

The Product Data Sheets (PDS), comprise descriptions of the products, product data, and guidelines/recommendations
for their use. The purpose is to achieve the best possible results when using the products.

Shade numbers
Hempel paints are supplied in colours identified by a
5-character, standard shade code as follows:

Hempel’s standard shade codes do not directly correlate
to official colour standard codes. Colours corresponding
to specific official standard colours may be established.

Frequently used colours/shades are displayed in Hempel’s

colour cards.

The fifth character may be used to identify specific
formulas for the same shade where a different type of
pigment is used, e.g. in order to conform to standards or
(local), legislation.

Note: Shade variation may be expected for products where
deviations are of less importance such as primers, many
intermediates and antifoulings. Uniform appearance of a topcoat is
best obtained by applying paint with same batch number.

Quality numbers

Product number + shade number.

Description
A short description of the product with emphasis on
generic type, pigmentation, principal properties, and

certain limitations.

Recommended use

The purpose(s), for which the product is designed or
particularly well suited. The product may be specified for
other uses in tailor-made paint systems for specific purposes.

Features

Summary of the most important product features.

Service temperature
Indicates the maximum temperature that will have no
immediate detrimental effect on the paint.

A service temperature constantly near the maximum will
result in a shorter lifetime of the specified paint system
compared to the lifetime anticipated when operating at
ambient temperatures. If service temperatures often
fluctuate between ambient temperatures and near maximum
temperatures, this will result in an additional decrease in the
anticipated lifetime of the paint system ‘accelerated ageing’.

Most paints will change appearance when exposed to
high temperatures, either by a change in colour and/or by
loss of gloss.

In addition many paints will become soft at high
temperatures and show higher sensitivity to mechanical

or chemical actions.

Exposure to warm liquids, water included, will normally
only be recommended for dedicated paint systems. At high
temperatures, wet service will have a more pronounced
influence on lifetime compared to dry service.

When a paint system is exposed to fluctuations of
temperatures, wet service conditions will induce more
stress to the coating system than dry service at the
same temperatures.

It is of importance whether the liquid has a higher
temperature than the coated steel. A ‘cold wall’ effect will
increase the risk of blistering and put further limitations to
the temperature resistance. Most paint systems only tolerate
a very low negative gradient of temperature under wet/

immersed service conditions.

Explanatory notes

Approvals, certificates
A list of key certificates and approvals. Other certificates
and approvals than listed may be available from Hempel

upon request.

## Physical constants

Colours/shade nos
See shade numbers on page 1. Certain physical constants
may vary from one colour to another.

Finish
The appearance of the paint film after drying under
optimum conditions in laboratory, given as high gloss (>90),
glossy (60-90), semi-gloss (30-60), semi-flat (15-30),
or flat (<15). All figures are in gloss units and according to
ISO 2813:1994(E), (specular gloss, 60° geometry). The
actual appearance will depend on the conditions during
application and drying/curing.

Volume solids
The Volume Solids (VS), figure expresses in percentage
the ratio:

Dry film thickness
Wet film thickness

The stated figure is determined under laboratory conditions,
after a drying period of 7 days at 23°C/73°F and 50 percent
relative humidity according to ISO 3233:1998, drying class 2.

For 100 percent solids volume products the theoretical value
is indicated. This value is not reflected in the ratio:

Dry film thickness
Wet film thickness

For all 100 percent products due to shrinkage during curing.

All volume solids values are given with ±1 - ±3 percent,
which is the standard deviation taking into account normal
manufacturing tolerances, experimental uncertainty etc.

Availability
Delivery of certain products requires notice in advance
for logistics reasons. Some product may not be available
in specific countries e.g. due to local legislation. This is
indicated by the expression ‘Local availability subject to
confirmation’.

Theoretical spreading rate
The theoretical spreading rate of the paint in a given dry
film thickness on a completely smooth surface is calculated
as follows:

Volume solids x 10
Dry film thickness (micron)

Volume solids % x 16.04
Dry film thickness (mils)

m2/litre

sq.ft./US
gallon

1 mil is rounded off to 25 micron - the exact value is

25.4 micron.

In the PDS the theoretical spreading rate is stated for
the indicated dry film thickness (DFT), that is usually
specified for the product. Some products may be specified
in different dry film thicknesses for different purposes,
which affects the spreading rate accordingly. Theoretical
spreading rate cannot be given for paint materials used for
saturation of an absorbing substrate, wood, concrete, etc.

The correction factors due to roughness of ISO 19840
have not been taken into account in the PDS. Actual

consumption will be higher when applying as a primer on
substrate with roughness.

The practical spreading rate is not given in the PDS as the
variation is too great to be represented by one single figure.

Explanatory notes

Consumption factor
The practical consumption is estimated by multiplying
the theoretical consumption with a relevant consumption
factor (CF).

The consumption factor depends on a number of external

conditions and cannot be stated in the PDS as the variation
is too great to be represented by one single figure.

Practical
consumption =

Area x CF

Theoretical spreading rate

The variation in the consumption factor is largely attributed
to the following:

1) Waviness of paint film
A manually applied paint film will unavoidably:
a) show some waviness of the surface and,
b) a thickness distribution with an average value
somewhat higher than the specified dry film thickness
in order to fulfil e.g. an 80:20 rule. This leads to higher
consumption than theoretically calculated.

2) Complexity and size/shape of the surface to be

calculated

Complex, odd-shaped and small-sized surfaces are
virtually impossible to paint without overspray and will
therefore lead to higher consumption than theoretically
calculated from the area in question.

3) Surface roughness of the substrate
Surface roughness of the substrate gives a ‘dead volume’
to be filled up or in the case of shopprimers a ‘surface
area ratio’ greater than one and will therefore cause a
higher consumption than theoretically calculated for

a smooth substrate.

4) Physical losses
Factors such as residues in cans, pumps and hoses,
discarded paint due to exceeded pot life, wind loss, etc.
will all contribute to a higher consumption.

The practical spreading rate thus varies with method of
application, skill of the painter, shape of the object to be
painted, texture of the substrate, film thickness applied,
and working conditions.

In any case it is not beneficial to stretch the paint as much
as possible, but rather try to obtain the specified thickness
of the applied paint on the entire area.

Flash point
The lowest temperature at which a liquid liberates sufficient
vapour to form a mixture with the air near its surface which,
if ignited, will make a small flash, but not catch fire.

The flash points of Hempel’s paints are measured according
to the Setaflash method (closed cup). For two-component
products flash points are normally given for the mixed
products. The figures are given as guidance with a view to
local regulations for precautions against fire during use.

Adding thinner to a paint may change the flash point
of the diluted material.

Specific gravity
The weight in kilograms per litre at 25°C/77°F.
An equivalent figure is given in lbs per US gallon.

For two-component products the specific gravity is given
for the mixed product.

The specific gravity may in practice vary in an interval of
a few percent compared to the theoretical value indicated

in the PDS.

Drying time in the Product Data Sheet
Surface-dry refers to surface-drying time, which is defined
and measured as described in the international standard

ISO 9117-3.

Through-dry refers to through-dry time, which is defined
and measured as described in the international standard

ISO 9117-1.

Dry to touch refers to the time the paint reaches stage III on
a Beck Koller recorder (ASTM D 5895-03).

Fully cured
The curing time is given for two-component products at a
(steel) temperature of 20°C/68°F and adequate ventilation.

V.O.C.

The calculated weight of volatile organic content in grammes
per litre. An equivalent figure is given in lbs per US gallon.
Detailed information on VOC of specific products is given
in the product’s Safety Data Sheet.

Explanatory notes

Shelf life

The time the product will keep in good condition when stored
under cover in original, sealed containers under normal
storage conditions. Shelf life is indicated in the PDS only if it
is one year or less at 25°C/77°F. It will decrease at higher
temperatures, e.g. will be almost halved at 35°C/95°F. The
canned product will carry a ‘best before’ label for guidance.

If no specific limitation is given, a paint should not be stored
for more than five years at 25°C/77°F or three years at
35°C/95°F for one-component products and three years at
25°C/77°F or two years at 35°C/95°F for two-component
products from the date of production.

Long-term storage and storage at high temperatures may
require careful remixing of the paint prior to application due
to (slight), sediment in the can.

If storage conditions are unknown and in any other cases
of doubt about the suitability of a paint material, this can
easily be verified by checking the following:

a) no corrosion of the inside of undamaged cans,
when opened

b) **** apparent viscosity in can: after remix, paint must not
appear gelatinous or require excessive thinning prior
to proper application
c) **** application in specified film thickness: a uniform,
closed paint film must be shown
d) drying time to be within the limit specified in the ****
PDS

## Application details

Mixing ratio
Two-component, chemically curing products are supplied as
base and curing agent in the correct mixing ratio. The mixing
ratio must be strictly adhered to, also when subdividing; as a
general rule, add the curing agent to the base.

It is very important for two-component products that
the prescribed amount of curing agent is added to the
base. In order to ensure this is done, it is in most cases
recommended to use the indicated thinner to flush the curing
agent can. Once the material has been mixed the curing will
proceed. Therefore, only the quantity needed within the pot
life of the mixture should be mixed at a time.

Batch number

All products carry a 9-digit batch number indicating
manufacturing unit and the date of production:

The first two digits indicate the production site. This
information is required for products carrying certain
certificates and type approvals, e.g. products approved
according to IMO Resolution MSC 215(82).

The third digit indicates the year of production, while the
fourth and fifth digits indicate the month of production.

Storage temperature
In order to maintain application properties as designed,
paints should not be stored at temperatures above
50°C/122°F prior to application. Waterborne paints must not
be exposed to frost.

Application method
Gives the possible or recommended method(s) of application.
As a general rule, the first coat of a rust-preventing primer
should be applied by brush or airless spray to obtain the best
possible wetting and penetration into the substrate.

Application by brush or roller usually requires more coats
to be applied to achieve the specified film thickness than
application by airless spray equipment.

Explanatory notes

Thinner (max.vol)
Hempel’s paints are delivered ready for application at
20°C/68°F by brush or airless spray after stirring (for
two-component products after mixing of base and curing
agent), in a given normal dry film thickness. If the paint is too
thick, e.g. in cold weather or for special purposes such as
application in lower film thickness, the thinner(s), indicated
under this heading may be added to give the required
viscosity. The amount of thinner to be added depends
on prevailing temperature, application method, etc.
The usual maximum percentage is indicated for the
respective application method. If more thinning is deemed
necessary under special circumstances, consult Hempel.

Adding a small percentage of thinner will give no measurable
difference in the film thickness. There are cases, however,
when a higher degree of thinning is necessary and justified.
It should then be kept in mind that adding thinner increases
the quantity of liquid paint without contributing to the
solids content. Consequently, a proportionally higher wet
film thickness must be applied when adding any significant
amount of thinner in order to obtain the specified dry
film thickness.

Avoid unnecessary and habitual thinning.

Use only the recommended thinner(s). Using wrong
thinner may negatively affect the properties of the
applied coating system.

Nozzle pressure
A nozzle pressure generally suitable is given.

Note: Airless spray data is offered as guidance and are subject
to adjustment to suit the work at hand.

Cleaning of tools
Normally the thinner indicated for the product can be used
for cleaning of tools after use. Where special cleaning agents
are recommended, it is indicated on the PDS.

Tools used in connection with waterborne paints may be
difficult to clean. Therefore, it is especially important to follow
the instructions stated in the PDS.

Indicated film thickness, dry
Dry film thickness (dft), is indicated in a thickness frequently
used in specifications.

Note: Several products are specified in different film thicknesses
for different purposes.

Dry film thicknesses are generally checked with gauges
calibrated on smooth reference steel panels. Shopprimers
are controlled according to a special procedure available
from Hempel upon request.

Example

If 0.5 litres of thinner is added to 20 litres of paint,
then the percentage of thinner added equals

0.5 x 100

20

VS percentage after thinning equals

VS% x 100

102.5

= 2.5%

VS% after
thinning =

VS% x 100

% thinner added + 100

Pot life

Roughly speaking, the pot life for solvent-borne paints
depends on the paint temperature as follows:

The pot life is halved at an increase in temperature of
10°C/18°F, and doubled at a decrease in temperature
of 10°C/18°F.

For Hempadur products the pot life is usually shorter for
application by airless spray than for brush application. This
is due to the fact that the anti-sagging properties are
gradually lost after expiration of the pot life indicated for
airless application. Thus the high dry film thickness usually
specified for airless spray application is only obtainable
within the pot life indicated for airless application.

Note: Pot life cannot be extended by thinning.

In the case of waterborne, two-component epoxy products
this rule of thumb does not apply. The influence of
temperature on the pot life is noted in the relevant

data sheets.

Nozzle orifice
A typical nozzle orifice (or a range of nozzle orifices), is
indicated.

Explanatory notes

Indicated film thickness, wet
Wet film thickness (wft), is indicated in multiples of
25 microns (1 mil), in order to facilitate the practical
measurements with the wet film thickness gauge (comb
gauge). These values are rounded off to the multiple of
25 which is regarded most relevant in each case.

Overcoating interval
The minimum and maximum overcoating intervals refer to
overcoating with the product itself as well as with other
relevant products such as topcoats. Minimum and any
maximum intervals should always be adhered to if the paint
system is to provide maximum protection.

Data is given for the relevant temperature range for the
product application at the indicated film thickness. The
intervals also refer to future exposure in atmospheric
conditions corresponding to corrosion classes C3 and C4
according to ISO 12944-2 and with limited mechanical wear.
Where relevant, overcoating intervals are also given for

immersion service in water.

Overcoating intervals are intended as guidelines as,
apart from temperature, film thickness and future service
conditions, they are also related to film number of coats,
type of exposure before overcoating and will be affected
correspondingly.

Details about overcoating intervals for complete coating
systems are stated in the relevant painting specification,
available upon request. A specification supercedes
any guideline overcoat intervals indicated in the PDS or
application instructions.

Minimum interval
The quoted figures for the minimum interval assume that
the coating has been applied according to the PDS in the
recommended film thickness, with good ventilation during
drying and within the recommended temperature range.
Spray application is assumed - other application procedures
such as brush application may require longer intervals.

Beware of the undesired influence of moisture and carbon
dioxide on epoxy and polyurethane paints which especially
occurs at low temperatures and high humidity. This will
result in a greasy surface preventing any adhesion of the
subsequent coat.

The minimum interval is prolonged with a factor of
approximately 1.7 if the film thickness is an average 50
percent higher than specified and a factor of approximately
2.4 for an average film thickness 100 percent higher.

Maximum interval

For maximum intervals the temperature in this context
is the highest surface temperature during the period.

Before overcoating, the surface must always be
thoroughly cleaned from any oil, grease, salt, dust or

other contamination.

For some paint types the interval may not be critical in
respect of adhesion, but a primer coat should not be left
unprotected for too long in an aggressive environment.
The maximum overcoating interval for such products is

denoted ‘none’.

Exposure to sun has a marked effect on the maximum
overcoating interval for some products and this must
be taken into consideration. If the maximum interval is

exceeded, it may be necessary to roughen the surface
to ensure adhesion of the next coat. When the interval is

denoted ‘extended’ the coated structure can possibly be
overcoated even after longer periods, depending on the
actual exposure conditions, such as limited exposure to sun
and depending on the condition and cleanliness of the paint
surface. The evaluation of the specific situation must be
based on local experience, contact Hempel for advice.

After exposure of any painted surface in polluted environment
thorough cleaning by high pressure fresh water hosing or
another appropriate measure is always recommended
before overcoating.

Safety
Under this heading general safety precautions when handling
or working with the product are given. Packings are provided
with applicable safety labels which should be observed.
In addition, safety data sheets, national or local safety
regulations should always be followed.

Surface preparation
The recommended degree of cleaning of the surface before
painting. The degrees of cleaning refer to ISO 8501-1:2007.
Preparation of steel substrates before application of paints
and related products - visual assessment of surface
cleanliness, unless otherwise indicated.

For some products a minimum surface profile is mandatory.
The profile specified is given with reference to one or more
of the roughness comparators: Rugotest No. 3, Keane-Tator
Comparator, or the ISO Comparator.

For previously painted surfaces the method and degree of
preparatory cleaning is generally indicated.

Explanatory notes

## Application conditions

If climatic or other limitations beyond what is dictated by
normal good painting practice apply to the use of a particular
quality of paint, this is indicated under this heading. As a
general rule, paint should never be applied under adverse
weather conditions. Even if the weather seems fit for
painting, there will be condensation if the temperature of the
substrate is at or below the dew point (the temperature at
which the atmospheric humidity condenses, e.g. as dew). To
compensate for fluctuations the temperature of the surface
should be at least a few degrees above the dew point during
painting and drying. 3°C/5°F is often quoted as safe.

Beware of ice on the surface at temperatures below the
freezing point.

In confined spaces it may be necessary to remove solvent
vapours or water vapours by providing an adequate amount
of fresh air constantly during application and drying, both
for reasons of safety and health, and to assist evaporation.

Keep the paint temperate, preferably above approximately
15°C/59°F when applying during winter. If not, the paint
will require excessive thinning leading to an increased risk
of sagging. Viscosity in any paint will increase if the
temperature decreases.

Preceding coat
Recommendations of some preceding paint(s), known
to be compatible with the product. No limitation is implied.
Other compatible products may be specified depending
on the purpose. In this context, shopprimers are regarded
as an integral part of the surface preparation.

Subsequent coat
Recommendations of some subsequent paint(s), known
to be compatible with the product. No limitation is implied.
Other compatible products may be specified depending on
the purpose.

## Remarks

Under this heading other relevant data or information

is included.

Issued by
The Hempel R&D region that developed the product.
This field demonstrates which R&D region owns the product.

Example

Denmark/Group: Hempel A/S - product reference

Note: The PDS are subject to change without notice and
automatically become void five years from issue. The date of issue
is depicted in the footer of each page.

## Additional notes and definitions of expressions used

Surface cleaning*

*As defined in ‘joint surface preparation standard NACE no. 5/SSPC-SP 12,

1995’.

Note: Wet abrasive blasting may be performed with low or
high pressure fresh water to which a relatively small amount of

abrasives is introduced. In some cases inhibitors are added to
prevent flash rusting (however, as a general rule it is recommended
not to use inhibitors when cleaning areas to be immersed during
service. Surplus of inhibitors may lead to osmotic blistering).

Damp surfaces
Water is not readily detectable, but the temperature of the
surface is below the dew point.

Moist surfaces

Pools of water and droplets have been removed, but there
is a noticeable film of water.

Wet surface

Droplets or pools of water are present.

Explanatory notes

Blast primer
A paint used for short term protection of a newly
blast-cleaned steel surface of an assembled structure

in order to ease the working procedures. In this context
blast primers are often regarded an integral part of the
surface preparation.

Holding primer
A paint used to prolong (hold), the protective lifetime of a
shopprimer until the specified paint system can be applied,
but is now used synonymously as a blast primer.

Mist coat/flash coat
A thin coat (10-25 μm), achieved by applying a thinned paint
by swift spray passes/with heavy atomisation. In common
usage, the terms are used synonymously.

Mist/flash coats are extensively used to saturate the
porosities in zinc silicates and thermally sprayed metals
with solvents prior to application of a full paint film. But also
sealer coats and tie coats are often applied as mist coats/
flash coats.

## Surface preparation standards

A number of official and unofficial standards for cleaning of
steel preparatory to painting are used.

Other prominent standards, notably:

Steel Structures Painting Council (U.S.A.): Surface
preparation specifications (SSPC-SP 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10 and 12)

and

International Standardisation Organization ISO 12944,
parts 1 through 8: Corrosion protection of steel structures
by protective paint systems,

also concern with the equipment, materials and procedures
used to achieve the specified finish.

The British Standards; BS 4232 and BS 7079 are both
superseded by ISO 8501-1.

The American standard uses the same photos as
ISO 8501-1. ISO 12944 refers to ISO 8501-1, but includes
also descriptions for secondary surface preparation with
reference to ISO 8501-2.

Tiecoat

A layer of paint which improves the adhesion between
coatings of different generic types, e.g. to ‘bridge’ between
conventional and advanced coatings, or between epoxy and
physically drying paints.

Sealer coat
A layer of paint which is used to seal off (fill the pores of),
porous surfaces such as concrete, zinc silicates and empty,
insoluble matrix of certain antifoulings. In this connection
it prevents disturbance of the balance between binder and
active pigments of the new antifouling. Furthermore, certain
paints may be used as sealer coats
to minimise popping of the following coat(s), when painting
a porous substrate.

Spillages and splashes
When a product is mentioned to be resistant to spillages
and splashes of certain chemicals, this is understood to be
limited in both area and time. The spilt chemical must be
removed as soon as possible and not later than 1-2 days.
Cosmetic change may appear.

Metric and US units
When converting between metric and US units figures may
be rounded to an appropriate number of digits.

They all take into account the state of the raw steel surface
before cleaning and grade the result accordingly:

a: steel surface largely covered with adherent mill scale
but little, if any, rust

b: steel surface which has begun to rust and from which
the mill scale has begun to flake

c: steel surface on which the mill scale has rusted away
or from which it can be scraped, but with slight pitting

visible under normal vision

d: steel surface on which the mill scale has rusted

away and on which general pitting is visible under

normal vision

A surface preparation method using high pressure water
for cleaning is getting more common. The best definition
of terms and surface preparation standards is presented
by ISO 8501-4.

For comparison of the standards see the following pages.
The text of the individual standards are quoted literally.

Comparing the standards, there is no doubt that Sa 3
and SSPC-SP-5 are identical in their demands to surface

cleanliness. Also Sa 2.5 and SSPC-SP-10 seem identical.

Concerning Sa 2 and SSPC-SP-6 these differ slightly,
SSPC-SP-6 expressing higher demands to quality. SSPC-SP-6
requires remnants being stains only. Sa 2 states ‘residual
contamination shall be firmly adhering’.

Note: For SSPC the written specification takes preference for ISO 8501-1.

## Abrasive blasting surface profile

Not only inorganic zinc coatings and solvent-free coatings,
but most paint systems require a roughened substrate
surface to obtain proper adhesion. The surface profile of
the roughened substrates is characterised by a surface
roughness and a roughness profile, which must be itemised
separately in specifications for surface preparation.

During field work the anchor pattern is conveniently
assessed by visual or tactile comparison, using standardised
comparators. Such comparators are e.g. Rugotest No. 3,
Keane-Tator Surface Profile Comparator, and ISO 8503
surface profile reference comparators.

Surface roughness
In connection with surface preparation, roughness is defined
as the irregularities in surface texture, which are caused by
blast-cleaning.

The roughness can be characterised by several roughness
values. Most often the roughness is designated by the
maximum height of the profile (peak-to-valley height),
RZz. Sometimes the arithmetical mean deviation of the
profile RA, previously known as CLA- and AA-values (Centre
Line Average and Arithmetical Average, respectively), is used.
Designations in boldface are according to ISO standard.

Because these values may have very different numerical
values assigned to them for a given surface, it is very
important to distinguish between them.

It is also important to note that roughness comparison
specimens may use different roughness values. Rugotest
No. 3 uses roughness numbers according to ISO 1302
and 2632-2/II (now obsolete), which are assigned to RAa
values. Keane-Tator Surface Profile Comparator uses the
maximum average peak-to-valley height, which resembles
RZz, while ISO surface profile reference comparators uses
the designations ‘fine’, ‘medium’, and ‘coarse’.

Although it is not possible to calculate RAa values from
RZz and vice versa, a working group of the international
Standards Sub Committee TC 35/SC 12 has established
that a good approximation for RZz is RAa x 6.

Roughness profile
Roughness profiles can be characterised as round or sharp
edged. Steel shot produces a round profile, while not worn
down steel grit as well as most mineral abrasives give a
sharp edge.

When a roughness profile is given in Hempel’s PDS it is
normally a sharp profile.

Because optical effects play a role when judging a surface
by means of comparators, both Rugotest No. 3, Keane-Tator
Surface Profile Comparator, and ISO surface profile reference
comparators all have different scales for different profiles.

Rugotest No. 3 has specimens for round and sharp profiles
collected in one comparator. For greater roughness values
there is even a division in fine and coarse grained finish.

Keane-Tator Surface Profile Comparator has three different
discs, designed by S (sand), G/S (steel or metallic grit),
and SH (shot), respectively.

ISO comparators are obtainable either as a ‘G’ version
or a ‘S’ version for use on gritblasted and shotblasted
surfaces, respectively.

The disc corresponding to the abrasive used must be
selected for comparison.

ii) additional consumption to fill up the ‘dead volume’ of the
surface roughness, but especially
iii) by the ‘waviness’ of the paint surface.
