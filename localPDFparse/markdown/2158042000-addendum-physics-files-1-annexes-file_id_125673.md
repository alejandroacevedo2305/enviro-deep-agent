**1. Introduction**

A B S T R A C T

The effects of nutrient effluents from fish cage aquaculture are an important eutrophication concern. It has been
proposed that marine fish farm derived nutrients have the potential to increase phytoplankton abundance and
lead to intensification of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), and that these blooms may negatively impact both the
finfish and the shellfish industry. This study addressed this hypothesis using farmed salmon biomass in Scottish
marine waters (as a proxy for nutrient load added to the water column as a consequence of fish farming) cell
abundance of HAB taxa that most frequently impact shellfish farms and human health in the region ( _Dinophysis_
spp., _Alexandrium_ spp. and _Pseudo-nitzschia_ spp.), and cell abundance of one phytoplankton species of particular
concern to the salmon farming industry ( _Karenia mikimotoi_ ). Data from a 15-year weekly HAB monitoring pro­
gramme and parallel national monitoring data relating to salmon farm stocking biomass were summarised in 5
km per 5 km aggregation boxes. Linear regression models were used to assess (i) inter-annual variation in cell
abundance and total annual farmed salmon biomass; (ii) intra-annual (monthly) variation in harmful phyto­
plankton cell abundance and salmon biomass; (iii) a further analysis included seasonal effects within the intraannual analysis. Farmed salmon biomass alone had a non-significant effect on cell abundance of any of the
studied phytoplankton taxa. In contrast, a significant effect on cell abundance was found when using location,
month or season as the predictive variable. Despite the non-significant impact of fish biomass on phytoplankton
counts, the relationship varied seasonally, with a different response of _Dinophysis_ spp. indicating a taxa specific
interaction. A possible explanation for the lack of a significant relationship between farmed salmon and harmful
phytoplankton cell abundance is that aquaculture farms are generally located in hydrodynamically energetic
locations where recurrent flushing likely allows efficient dilution of nutrients. Overall, the analyses suggest that
current levels of salmon farming activities do not markedly impact the abundance of routinely monitored bio­
toxin producing or fish killing phytoplankton taxa in Scottish waters.

Understanding the link between anthropogenic activities and
harmful algal bloom (HAB) distribution and frequency is pivotal to the
development of mitigation and forecasting tools (Hallegraeff, 2010;
Wells et al., 2020). Aquaculture has often long been associated to
disturbance of the coastal marine environment (Buschmann et al., 2006;
Maroni, 2000; Mente et al., 2006). A longstanding and worldwide
concern relates to aquaculture effluents including nutrients, antibiotics
and biological waste, and their potential detrimental impacts. Farmed
fish feed is converted partially into fish biomass, with associated
nutrient releases related to soluble waste, uneaten feed, excretion
through gills (un-ionised ammonia) and faecal material (Enwereuzoh

et al., 2021). Elevated nutrient concentrations close to fish cages have
been observed in some locations (Tsagaraki et al., 2013), although this is
not universal (Soto and Norambuena, 2004). The composition of fish
feed released into the environment has been estimated as 70 % of car­

bon, 62 % nitrogen and 70 % phosphorus by Wang et al. (2012). Nu­
trients including dissolved inorganic nitrogen (ammonium) and
phosphorus (phosphate) discharged through excretion, are readily
available for phytoplankton utilisation (Anderson et al., 2002; Glibert
et al., 2016; Heisler et al., 2008). The amount of dissolved nitrogen
released into the environment by farmed salmon has been estimated to
be 110.6 kg per tonne of edible weight (Gephart et al., 2021). Inorganic
carbon (CO 2 ) is released through respiration, whilst particulate and
dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus by defecation and

waste feed (Bouwman et al., 2013). Heterotrophic or mixotrophic spe­
cies can also consume dissolved organic forms of these nutrients (Pete
et al., 2010; Reguera et al., 2012).
Elevated concentrations of anthropogenic nutrients can explain HAB
events in some restricted exchange environments (Glibert et al., 2005;
Gowen et al., 2012; Lei et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2010). Studies also have
demonstrated fish farming can cause a direct and positive impact on
chlorophyll-a concentrations (as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass) in
the water column in locations such as the Archipelago Sea in
south-western Finland (Honkanen and Helminen, 2000), the Baltic Sea
(Nordvarg and Håkanson, 2002) and the Mediterranean Sea (Modica
et al., 2006). Using chlorophyll-a constitutes a limitation since it varies
based on species, seasonality and response to light adaption (Felip and
Catalan, 2000), and increased chlorophyll does not guarantee a harmful
species’ development.
In contrast, little or no evidence of a relationship between cultured
fish, nutrient discharges and primary production or algal biomass has
been found in Scotland (Black et al., 2002; Heath et al., 2002; Navarro
et al., 2008; Ross et al., 1993; Rydberg et al., 2003; Smayda, 2006),
Norway (Husa et al., 2014) and Greece (Pitta et al., 2009, 2006). A
number of explanations have been proposed for this lack of significant
phytoplankton response in proximity to fish farm locations, such as the
hydrodynamic conditions and the efficiency of the water system to
dilute and redistribute nutrients (Glibert, 2020; Urbina, 2016;
Yokoyama, 2014). Other studies describe the efficiency of nutrient
assimilation by phytoplankton (Challouf et al., 2017; Price et al., 2015),
trophic interactions with ciliates (Pitta et al., 2009; Ross et al., 1993)
and bacteria (Fuhrman et al., 1989). These works demonstrate that
despite phytoplankton being able to thrive when nutrients are replete,
nutrients are not the only factors that affect cell proliferation, and
highlights the need to assess other variables that could modulate the
phytoplankton community response, such as location or seasonality.
Notwithstanding the debate on whether and where fish farm nutri­
ents promote phytoplankton growth, a further question is whether any
enhanced phytoplankton abundance is benign or harmful. In relation to
aquaculture, such harm may occur through the temporary closure of
shellfish farms if they become impacted by HAB generated biotoxins
synthesised by certain phytoplankton; these biotoxins are concentrated
in the flesh of the filter feeding shellfish with the potential to harm
human consumers (Berdalet et al., 2016; Davidson et al., 2011). In
Scotland, the main syndromes of concern are: Diarrheic Shellfish
Poisoning, expressed though gastrointestinal problems including diar­
rhoea and vomiting, principally as a result of toxins synthesised by the
genus _Dinophysis_ (Vale and Sampayo, 2002); Paralytic Shellfish
Poisoning related to toxins from the genus _Alexandrium,_ which affects
the gastrointestinal system and also causes difficulty in breathing, with
neurological symptoms including numbness of body parts or facial pa­
ralysis (García et al., 2005); Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning from the genus
_Pseudo-nitzschia_, produces neurological symptoms such as dizziness, loss
of short-term memory and seizures (Van Dolah, 2000). In addition,
harmful phytoplankton may have negative impacts on the farmed fish
themselves. These events typically present as i) physical or mechanical
damage of gill structures (Delegrange et al., 2015; Jones and Rhodes,
1994); ii) ichthyotoxic effects, through disruption of osmoregulatory
capacity (Brusl ́e, 1995); iii) blood hypoxia caused by deoxygenation or
decrease of available oxygen in the water column (Baptie and Swan,
2017; Jones et al., 1982); iv) extreme oxygen supersaturation related to
algal photosynthesis, leading to gill lesions and gas bubble trauma
symptoms (Lutz, 1995; Rodger et al., 2011); and v) oxidation of cell
membranes by reactive oxygen species and polyunsaturated fatty acids
(Mardones et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2003).
Salmon farming is a major industry in Scotland. The country is
placed third in terms of worldwide production (Iversen et al., 2020)
with, in 2020, a reported total production of 193,129 tonnes equivalent
to a value of £932,310,650 (Munro, 2021). The potential for salmon
farm derived nutrients to promote growth of harmful phytoplankton in

Scottish waters has been hypothesised, with concerns over the potential
impact on shellfish farming and human health, fish farms mortalities, as
well as birds and marine mammals (MacGarvin, 2000). This led the
Scottish Government (then the Scottish Executive) to commission two

- HAB
independent international reviews of the fish farm nutrient
relationship in Scottish waters (Rydberg et al., 2003; Smayda, 2006).
Both reviews (evaluating available literature) indicated that no causa­
tive relationship was evident, but these conclusions lacked a quantita­
tive underpinning. Subsequently, the establishment of a fixed set of
harmful phytoplankton sampling locations within the regulatory moni­
toring programme for biotoxin producing phytoplankton (since 2006),
and the availability of information relating to salmon farm biomass, has
provided data for a statistical evaluation of the fish farm - HAB hy­
pothesis on a countrywide scale.
Diverse mathematical models have been used to assess the rela­
tionship between fish farming and phytoplankton. Studies have used
ANOVA tests to assess the significance of any relationships with
chlorophyll-a concentrations at different depths or locations (Honkanen
and Helminen, 2000; Modica et al., 2006; Navarro et al., 2008; Pitta
et al., 2006). More complex biogeochemical models have evaluated the
role of nutrients in the dynamics of harmful phytoplankton taxa,
although these are difficult to apply outside of specific case study lo­
cations. Linear statistical models can be applied to quantify the rela­
tionship between cell abundance and one or more predictors over wide
spatial and temporal data sets. For example, the multidecadal study
carried out in the Northeast Atlantic by Hinder et al. (2012) undertook a
form of linear modelling called Granger causality criteria to predict
future values of plankton abundance, finding significant and synergic
relationships with sea temperature and wind conditions. Linear regres­
sion was also applied to identify the main variables related to an
_Karenia mikimotoi_ across the
exceptional bloom of the dinoflagellate
west coast of Scotland in 2006 (Davidson et al., 2015, 2009).
To allow the aquaculture industry as a whole to best manage its HAB
risk, more information is needed to elucidate the potential effect of fish
farming on phytoplankton abundance, specifically HAB causative spe­
cies, since the abundance of these organisms varies regionally (Gianella
et al., 2021). The study presented here therefore assessed the relation­
ship between cultured salmon biomass and abundance of harmful
phytoplankton in Scottish waters by applying linear models to freely
accessed long-term time series data. Analysis of these data allowed the
assessment of salmon farming intensification and the long-time claim
that this influences HAB development. Specifically, this study addressed
the hypothesis that locations of greater salmon biomass experience
significantly increased abundance of the major phytoplankton taxa of
concern to the shellfish industry in Scottish waters ( _Dinophysis_ spp.,
_Alexandrium_ spp., _Pseudo-nitzshia_ spp.) and the ichthyotoxic _Karenia_
_mikimotoi_ .

**2. Methods**

_2.1. Data accessed: farmed salmon biomass and phytoplankton_
_abundance_

National monitoring data relating to salmon ( _Salmon salar_ ) farm
stocking biomass was freely accessed and downloaded from ‘Scotland’s
aquaculture’ [website (www.aquaculture.scotland.gov.uk/). Monthly](http://www.aquaculture.scotland.gov.uk/)
data of farmed salmon ‘actual biomass (on site)’ was extracted to allow
the analysis of temporal and spatial trends.
Phytoplankton cell abundance data was accessed from weekly
monitoring reports produced by Food Standards Scotland (FSS) as part
of their shellfish safety official control regulatory monitoring pro­
[gramme (https://www.foodstandards.gov.scot/business-and-industry).](https://www.foodstandards.gov.scot/business-and-industry)
The identification and enumeration of harmful phytoplankton is carried
out by the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) under con­
tract from FSS. The collection of water samples for identification of
harmful related taxa follows the UK National Reference Laboratory

(UKNRL) Standard Procedure (UKNRL, 2023). Water samples are
collected from representative monitoring points (RMPs) across the
coastline, predominantly located in the west coast and isles where
shellfish culturing is active. Sampling involves collection of water
samples from areas adjacent to the shellfish bed and generally employs a
10 metre “Lund tube”. Samples of 500 mL are preserved in Lugol’s
iodine prior to analysis under light microscopy at SAMS. The present
study focuses on taxa of main concern for shellfish farming: the di­
noflagellates _Dinophysis_ spp., _Alexandrium_ spp. and the diatom _Pseudo-­_
_nitzschia_ _Karenia mikimotoi_
spp. The dinoflagellate impacting fish
farming, of great concern for this sector, is also enumerated in the FSS
data series and hence was included in the analysis. Parallel phyto­
plankton and farmed salmon biomass time series were available from
2006 to 2020. Active fish and shellfish farming sites in Scotland are
displayed in Fig. 1.

_2.2. Statistical analyses_

The assessment of phytoplankton cell abundance (cells per litre) as a
function of farmed salmon biomass was made by applying linear models
using cell abundance as a response variable with predictor variables
including fish biomass, spatial location (aggregation boxes, see Fig. 1)
and time as year (Section 2.2.1), or used to stratify the analysis by month
(Section. 2.2.2). All analyses were performed using the linear model
function ( _lm_ ) in R (R Core Team, 2021). Cell abundance was fourth-root
transformed to reduce heterogeneity and skewness observed in the time
series. As salmon biomass and phytoplankton databases were available

**Fig. 1.** Salmon farming sites (blue circles, farms active for _>_ 7 years) and HAB
sampling locations (white circles) in Scotland. Mid grey boxes show 50 km
aggregation areas for those HAB sampling and fish farm locations used in the
analysis. Small boxes are 5 km areas around HAB sampling locations. Data was

accessed from ‘Scotland s aquaculture .

from different locations and collected at different frequency, data were
grouped by aggregating both datasets separately into boxes of 5 km by 5
km (also referred as ‘aggregation boxes’), giving a total of 40 boxes
across the country. The two long-term datasets were then merged to
allow comparison of phytoplankton impacting aquaculture farms and
farmed salmon biomass in each locality.

_2.2.1. Inter-annual relationship between salmon biomass and average_
_abundance of HAB related phytoplankton taxa_
For this analysis, the total annual sum of farmed salmon biomass in
an aggregation box was employed to assess its effect on cell abundanceacross the monitoring period (2006 2020). The analysis was conducted
using data from the phytoplankton growth season from March to
October, since cell abundance is generally above zero during this time
(Gianella et al., 2021). Sites that contained records below seven years of
salmon biomass were excluded from the analysis to remove missing
values and allow a better comparison with the phytoplankton data se­
ries. This constrained the analysis to 23 aggregation boxes in total. The
relationship between annual salmon biomass and potential impact on
annual phytoplankton abundance of HAB associated taxa across the time
series was evaluated (Table 1, Model T1). The addition of the grouped
boxes (5 km by 5 km areas) as an independent variable (Table 1, Models,
T2, T3) allowed investigation of the influence of location on this rela­
tionship, either as a group or as an individual box effect.

_2.2.2. Intra-annual relationships between salmon biomass and average_
_abundance of HAB related phytoplankton taxa_
The total salmon biomass and the FSS reported phytoplankton
abundance of HAB related taxa were calculated on a monthly basis,
again grouped in 5 km by 5 km aggregation boxes ( _n_ = 40). This analysis
assessed the direct effect of total farmed salmon biomass on averaged
phytoplankton cell abundance amongst locations across Scotland, thus
investigating any spatial effect of salmon farming on phytoplankton
abundance (Model S0, Table 1). A limitation of this approach is the
calculation of one value per box for the whole time series. Hence, sub­
sequent models determined this linear relationship monthly (January December) by including month as an independent variable to account
for seasonal variability throughout the year (Table 1, Models S1-S3).
Due to the significant effect of seasonality on cell abundance, assess­
ing the effect of salmon biomass required the removal of the apparent
seasonal interaction in the regression slopes, thus this was considered in
another linear model (Model S4, Table 1).

inter-annual analysis, model T2 was used for _Dinophysis_ spp., _Alexandrium_ spp.

the intra-annual analysis, model S2 was applied for all taxa. * = integration of

_2.2.3. Model application_
The models were applied to each phytoplankton taxa to assess the
response of cell abundance to salmon biomass as a predictor variable
(Table 1). The models for both temporal and spatial assessments
comprised Models T1, S0 and S1: all utilising a simple model relating
phytoplankton cell counts to salmon biomass only, with a common
intercept and slope, assuming a simple relationship across the study
region; Models T2 and S2: apply a model including different intercepts
for each aggregation box, but a common slope relating phytoplankton
cell counts to fish biomass (all taxa, both analyses); and Models T3 and
S3: employing different intercepts and slopes and allowing different
relationships of phytoplankton cells counts versus salmon biomass for
each box. Model S4: assessed cell abundance response with respect of the
sum of salmon biomass with an interaction for each season, and separate
intercepts every month. Seasons were categorized as winter (December
to February), spring (March to May), summer (June to August) and
autumn (September to November).
The fit of the models, and the evaluation of significant differences in
variance explained in comparison to the simplest model, was assessed
with the analysis of variance (ANOVA). R-squared (proportion of vari­
ance explained, R [2] ), residual sums of squares (RSS), F-value and sig­
nificance (Pr _>F_ ) were estimated to determine the model that best
explained cell abundance variance. Akaike scores were employed to
compare the fit of the models to the data and assess quality, applying the
AIC function in R and selecting the one with the lowest score (Akaike,
1974). Effects of the independent variables and components within this,
if more than one (months or grouped areas in boxes), were summarised
with the regression coefficients from each linear model. F-values from
ANOVA were also applied to test the significant effect of independent
variables on cell abundance.

**3. Results**

_3.1. Farmed salmon biomass in Scotland_

Farmed salmon biomass has steadily increased across the available
time series (2002-2020) as the industry has expanded and developed.
This is illustrated by the increase in the annual cumulative sum of this
parameter across the country, reaching a maximum production of
1613,933 tonnes in 2020 (Fig. 2).

_3.2. Phytoplankton abundance temporal trends across Scotland_

Phytoplankton cell abundance portrayed an inter-annual variability
across the time series (2006-2020) for all taxa (Fig. 3).

_3.3. Inter-annual relationships between salmon biomass and average_
_abundance of HAB related phytoplankton taxa_

_3.3.1. Inter-annual analysis model selection_
The analysis evaluating the relationship between averaged annual
cell abundance and total annual salmon biomass (per group ‘box’)
demonstrated that including location (‘boxes’) as a predictor variable in
the model (Model T2), improved the explanation of the variance in
annual cell abundance of _Dinophysis_ spp., _Alexandrium_ spp. and _Pseudo-_
_nitzschia_ spp., with a significant difference (Pr _<_ 0.05) compared to the
simplest model (Model T1) that only used annual salmon biomass (Table
A1, Supplementary material). Model T2 showed a better fit to the data
with the maximum difference (F-value) and the lowest Akaike score for
all models tested (Table A1, Supplementary material), in comparison to
Model T1, explaining a higher proportion of data variance (sum of
squares). Allowing the annual relationship per box to follow different
slopes for each aggregation box (Model T3) did not improve the

explanatory power of the model, as was evident from the non-significant
difference in the results of Model T3 from Model T1 (Table A1, Sup­
plementary material).
Despite the relationship between salmon biomass and cell abundance
of shellfish biotoxin producing taxa being best explained on a
geographical basis, salmon biomass did not have a strong explanatory
effect on the variance of phytoplankton abundance for any of the four
taxa studied. For the three shellfish toxin producing genera, a low pro­
portion of the total variance in cell abundance was explained (R [2 ]

adjusted) ~15.1 % for _Dinophysis_ spp. ~14.6 % for _Alexandrium_ spp. and
~17.5 % for _Pseudo-nitzschia_ spp. (Table 2).
In contrast to the three shellfish toxin producing genera, for the
relationship between _Karenia mikimotoi_ cell abundance and salmon
biomass, the simplest model (Model T1) excluding location as a pre­
dictor variable best explained cell abundance variance and exhibited a
lower Akaike value than models including location (Models T2, T3),
which were non-significantly different (Pr _>_ 0.05) (Table A1, Supple­
mentary material). However, even applying the best temporal rela­
tionship of Model T1, annual farmed salmon biomass had a negligible
effect on _K. mikimotoi_ abundance, only explaining ~0.04 % of cell
variance (Table 2).

_3.3.2. Inter-annual analysis patterns per taxa and location_
As the relationship between cell abundance and salmon biomass was
best explained by individual relationships per grouped box for most taxa
( _K. mikimotoi_ was the only exception), this model was used to display
and interpret trends across the country and between taxa. The rela­
tionship between annual salmon biomass and mean cell abundance
portrayed different trends according to location for all taxa (Fig. 4). A
decreasing linear trend (Fig. 4, black line) of cell abundance with respect
to salmon biomass was observed for _Dinophysis_ spp., _Alexandrium_ spp.
and _Karenia mikimotoi_ (Fig. 4A, 4B, 4D), whilst _Pseudo-nitzschia_ spp.
abundance generally showed an increasing trend (Fig. 4C). A significant
salmon biomass effect was found for _Dinophysis_ spp. observed in the
ANOVA test (Table 2), but the effect per grouped box tested and
observed in the linear model’s summary (Table A2, Supplementary
material) was non-significant, indicating that (in common with the other
taxa), salmon biomass does not act as a predictor of this genus.

_3.4. Intra-annual relationships between salmon biomass and average_
_abundance of HAB related phytoplankton taxa_

_3.4.1. Intra-annual analysis: simple model_
The effect of total salmon biomass on cell abundance (per taxa) at a
spatial scale was assessed. The simplest model (Model S0, Table 1)
encompassed the average of these variables per aggregation box to
assess their direct relationship. Countrywide, cell abundance for all taxa
portrayed a decreasing trend with respect to increasing salmon farmed
biomass, but this relationship was non-significant (Fig. 5A, B, C, D).

_3.4.2. Intra-annual analysis model selection_
In recognition of the annual variability of harmful cells and the
limitation of employing a single (averaged) value per aggregation box,
the spatial effect of salmon biomass was further investigated by incor­
porating the effect of month and season on the relationship. The addition
of month as an independent variable markedly improved the explana­
tion of cell abundance variance, as expected given the seasonality of
phytoplankton (Fig. 3, Table A3, Supplementary material). This was
evident in the significant difference between models, with a bespoke
slope per month (Model S2) from the simple model that portrayed a
single relationship (Model S1) for all taxa. The strong seasonality effect
was also observed in the extremely low proportion of variance explained
(R [2] ), applying Model S1 in comparison to models including months as a

predictor variable (Models S2, S3 in Table A3, Supplementary material).
The linear regression better explained this relationship (lower sum of
squares) with individual slopes and intercepts per month (Model S3),
but this was not significantly different from the simplest model (Model
S1). It is important to underline that the response of cell abundance is
strongly influenced by month, which exerts a significant effect on cell
abundance (Table 3) and there is a negligible effect of salmon biomass.
Confirmation that an individual regression per box with a common slope
per month (Model S2) best explained the variance of cells was obtained
from this model, generating the lowest Akaike scores for all taxa and
explaining (adjusted R [2] ) ~68 % of _Dinophysis_ cell abundance, ~43 % of
_Alexandrium_, ~42 % for _Pseudo-nitzschia_ and ~31 % for _Karenia miki­_

_and abundance of HAB related phytoplankton taxa_
The relationship between monthly salmon biomass averaged per site
and cell abundance displayed heterogeneous patterns with no consistent

increase of cells in areas of higher salmon biomass (Fig. 6). A higher
number of positive relationships were observed during summer in
comparison with winter months, between March and September for
_Dinophysis_ and _Alexandrium_ (Tables A4, A5, Supplementary material);
February to October for _Pseudo-nitzschia_ and May to October for _Karenia_
_mikimotoi,_ observed from the positive effect of the monthly components
in the linear model functions (Tables A6, A7, Supplementary material).
The total monthly salmon biomass exhibited a non-significant effect on
averaged mean cell abundance for all taxa, the only exception was for
_Pseudo-nitzschia_ spp. cell abundance (Table A3) but the effect of this
independent variable was non-significant in the linear regression sum­
mary (Table A6, Supplementary material).

_3.4.4. Intra-annual analysis: seasonal stratification of salmon biomass and_
_average abundance of HAB related taxa_
Given the significant effect of month observed in the previous anal­
ysis (Sections 3.4.2 and 3.4.3), the relationship between farmed salmon
biomass and cell abundance was assessed by including the seasonal

interaction with farmed salmon biomass (model S4). In this analysis,
independent variables ‘season’ and ‘month’ showed a significant effect
on cell abundance for all taxa (Table 4). In contrast, salmon biomass as
an independent variable had a non-significant effect on cell abundance
for all taxa; moreover salmon biomass combined with seasons was nonsignificant for all taxa, except for _Alexandrium_ spp. (Table 4). Despite the
_Alexandrium_ when salmon biomass is com­
significant relationship for
bined with seasons, this explained a smaller proportion of cell variance
than other independent variables (seasons and months) as observed
from the lower sum of squares values, suggesting the predictive power of
salmon biomass combined with seasons is weak for explaining cell
abundance response (Table 4). Whilst the lowest Akaike score was
achieved applying the seasonal stratification model (S4) and the highest
proportion of explained cell variance being observed for: _Dinophysis_ spp.
(~69 %), _Alexandrium_ spp. (~45 %) and _Pseudo-nitzschia_ spp. (~43 %),
this model was not significantly different from the simplest model
(model S0) that assessed cell abundance as a function of the total salmon

biomass per aggregation box (Table A3, Supplementary material). This
contrasts with the significant results observed in models with an indi­
vidual slope per month (Models S1 and S2 for _Dinophysis_ spp. and
_Pseudo-nitzschia_ spp., S2 for _Alexandrium_ spp. and _Karenia mikimotoi_,
Table A3, Supplementary material).
Salmon biomass combined with seasons did show a significant effect
on _Dinophysis_ spp. and _Alexandrium_ spp. cell abundance, whilst the effect
of using only the sum of salmon biomass was non-significant (Table 4).
The relationship between salmon biomass and cell abundance generallyshowed a decreasing trend in all seasons (Figs. A1 A4, Supplementary
material). In contrast, a positive trend was observed in the months of
July and August for _Dinophysis_ spp. (Fig. A1-C, A1-D, Supplementary
material); in July, August, and autumn months (September, October,
November) for _Alexandrium_ spp. (Fig. A2-C,A2-D, Supplementary ma­

**4. Discussion**

The use of a 15-year time series allowed the statistical evaluation of
temporal and spatial associations between salmon farming and the
abundance of important shellfish biotoxin producing and ichthyotoxic
harmful phytoplankton taxa on a countrywide scale in Scottish waters.
The study demonstrated that salmon rearing intensity across the time
series (both annually and spatially) did not have a significant effect on
cell abundance of harmful dinoflagellates _Dinophysis_ spp _., Alexandrium_
spp. and _Karenia mikimotoi_ or the diatom _Pseudo-nitzschia_ spp. This
model based conclusion is consistent with previous qualitative studies
(Rydberg et al., 2003; Smayda, 2006) and with the observation of a
linearly increasing temporal trend in farmed salmon biomass in all re­
gions of Scottish waters, but a contrasting high inter-annual variability
of harmful phytoplankton bloom occurrence (Gianella et al., 2021).
Waters adjacent to marine fish farming activities might be expected
to exhibit elevated nutrient concentrations due to discharges from the
cages (Wang et al., 2012; Wu, 1995). However, in many studies fish
farming has been found to have a non-significant effect on nutrient
concentrations in nearby water samples in comparison with control sites
(areas with absence of fish farms) (Basaran et al., 2010; La Rosa et al.,

2002; Neofitou and Klaoudatos, 2008; Sanderson et al., 2012). Studies
have demonstrated that well flushed water can prevent eutrophication
and associated harmful blooms (Glibert, 2020; Urbina, 2016;
Yokoyama, 2014), and that these events are a feature of restricted water
systems (low hydrodynamics, flushing rates or water exchange) such as
Tolo Harbour in Hong Kong (Lei et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2010), Loch
Striven on the Scottish west coast (Tett et al., 1986) and the Seto Inland
Sea of Japan (Gowen et al., 2012). However, enriched but more ener­
getic waters including Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong (Xu et al., 2010),
Carlingford Lough, on the border between Northern Ireland and the
Republic of Ireland (Capuzzo, 2011), and the eastern Irish Sea (Gowen
et al., 2008) do not experience issues related to eutrophication. A po­
tential explanation for the lack of observed relationship between salmon
biomass and harmful phytoplankton abundance found in the present
analyses, is therefore the dynamic nature of water bodies in which fish
cages are typically located (Pitta et al., 2006; Soto and Norambuena,
2004; Urbina, 2016; Yokoyama, 2014). In Scotland, the location of
salmon farms is controlled by the regulator (The Scottish Environment
Protection Agency) based on the need to minimise their benthic impact
(Black et al., 2002), and therefore most are located in energetic water
bodies. Hence, the non-significant impact of salmon farming on harmful
phytoplankton found in this study could be related to this practice.
Further explanations of the lack of impact of anthropogenic nutrient
additions on phytoplankton growth have been proposed in diverse
theories such as the efficient assimilation of nutrients by phytoplankton
species (Price et al., 2015) and the presence of heterotrophic organisms
(Challouf et al., 2017). Trophic interactions related to ciliate grazing
(Pitta et al., 2009; Ross et al., 1993) or uptake of nutrients by bacteria
(Fuhrman et al., 1989) have also been suggested. Light availability (Tett
et al., 2011) and limitation due to self-shading effects from other cells
and suspended matter from fish farm effluents may also be a control
mechanism for microorganism growth, as observed for the cyanobac­
teria _Microcystis aeruginosa_ in a freshwater environment (Stirling and
Dey, 1990).

On an annual-basis, total salmon biomass had a negative effect on
_Dinophysis_ spp. abundance, but this was not observed when assessing
each study area (box 5 km) individually. These significant but con­
trasting outcomes indicate a complex relationship, which might be
influenced by other variables such as the mixotrophic characteristic of
this taxa. It would be interesting to explore the effect of salmon biomass
on this dinoflagellate’s prey ( _Mesodinium rubrum_ ) (Park et al., 2006) and
photosynthetic organisms further down the food chain. For the other
taxa ( _Alexandrium_ spp., _Pseudo-nitzschia_ spp. and _Karenia mikimotoi_ ), this
relationship was non-significant but the general trend of the relationship
between cell abundance and salmon farm biomass also followed a
decreasing trend. Arzul et al. (2001) proposed fish detritus caused
growth inhibition for the diatom _Chaetoceros gracilis_ and the dinofla­
gellate _Heterosigma akashiwo_ under laboratory conditions. Ammonium is
well known to support phytoplankton growth (Ryther and Dunstan,
1971) and can act as an inhibitor of nitrate assimilation by phyto­
plankton species, and negatively influence phytoplankton growth
(Dugdale et al., 2007; Glibert et al., 2016; Lomas and Glibert, 1999).
These relationships could potentially help to explain the negative trends
of the studied taxa as a function of increasing farmed fish biomass.
Spatial-temporal HAB patterns are variable between taxa in Scotland
(Gianella et al., 2021). This has been previously related to the specific
hydrodynamics of fjordic loch systems and coastal waters, and how
these influence local nutrient conditions (Davidson et al., 2012). The
characteristics of the different sea lochs in which Scottish salmon farms
are typically located vary markedly, for instance flushing times vary
from less than 1 day to 14 days in Scotland (Edwards and Sharples,
1986), suggesting that localised bloom development is likely (Gianella
et al., 2021). Frontal systems have also been shown to sustain conditions
that enhance phytoplankton growth due to the nutrient availability
(Franks, 1992; Franks and Chen, 1996). Paterson et al. (2017) demon­
strated that the temperature front found between the mouth of Loch
Fyne and the outer Clyde water mass in the southwest of Scotland acted
as a site for the development of a _Dinophysis_ bloom, but as the bloom
developed on the seaward site, also as a barrier for the bloom’s transport
to aquaculture sites in the loch. These complex dynamics require further
study and understanding to improve HAB prediction.
Consistent with this spatial temporal variability, geographical loca­
tion and seasonality were important predictors in the linear regression
models, generating a better fit and explaining a higher proportion
variance than models excluding them. This coincides with studies else­
where that also demonstrated that these variables were more important
in controlling cell abundance than fish farm effluents (Skeji ́c et al., 2011). Seasonality has been shown to be as a key factor in Pitta et al., 1999;
explaining phytoplankton community composition (Bresnan et al.,
2015). In the intra-annual relationship analysis when assessing seasonal
interaction, the effect of salmon farmed biomass varies, including a
significant effect on _Dinophysis_ spp. and _Alexandrium_ spp. cell abun­
dance. Despite this finding, the relationship between salmon biomass
and cell abundance is only very weak. Moreover, salmon biomass as an
independent variable had a non-significant effect in the intra-annual
analyses for all taxa, in contrast to spatial (location) and temporal
(month) variables demonstrating the greater importance of these.
Despite HAB events being a recurrent and serious issue for the
aquaculture industry, little information on fish mortalities is reported in
the literature, with publications only focusing on the most severe events.
Only three references have reported blooms impacting the Scottish
coastline, exclusively for one species ( _Karenia mikimotoi_ ) in the time
frame of the present study (2006 - 2020). This includes a temporally and
spatially prolonged bloom event in 2006, that initiated in the south west
coast and reached the Shetland Islands (Davidson et al., 2009; Gillibrand
et al., 2016); a bloom that caused hypoxic conditions and mass mortality
of marine life (Baptie and Swan, 2017), but no fish farm impact due to
their absence in this area; and an event that affected Loch Ryan in 2016
(ICES-IOC et al., 2020). However, voluntarily reported mortality data

for the period from 2014 showed 119 records of phytoplankton related
mortality impacting over 1.3 million fish. The Scottish salmon industry
indicate that harmful phytoplankton are one of their main fish health
concerns (I. Berrill, Salmon Scotland, pers. comm.), with most farms
monitoring HAB taxa on a daily basis. Discussions are underway to
promote access to and sharing of these data.

**5. Conclusions**

Salmon biomass and harmful phytoplankton have been monitored
and well documented for 15 years in Scotland, providing robust and
freely available information that allowed the identification of country­
wide links between these quantities at an annual and spatial scale (using
5 km per 5 km aggregation boxes). The assessment of long-term data­
bases addressed the globally relevant question of whether farmed fish
biomass has an effect on phytoplankton abundance and ultimately on
HAB development. The analyses indicated farmed salmon biomass in
Scotland did not have a significant effect on cell abundance of HAB taxa
_Dinophysis_ spp., _Alexandrium_ spp., _Pseudo-nitzschia_ spp. and _Karenia_
_mikimotoi_ . This contrasted with the role of location, month and seasons,
which had a significant effect on cell abundance, highlighted in the
regression models that included these as independent variables, gener­
ating a better fit and explaining a higher proportion of cell variance.
While non-significant, the effect of salmon biomass did vary seasonally,
with its impact on cell abundance being mainly negative, except
(mainly) in summer months. In particular, the contrasting response of
_Dinophysis_ spp. (compared to other taxa) suggests the relationship be­
tween fish biomass and harmful phytoplankton is complex and poten­
tially taxon specific. The lack of a fish farm-HAB relationship may be
explained by the dilution of nutrients since salmon cages are typically
located in areas of high flushing rates, but confirmation of this requires
_in situ_ evaluation of both nutrient concentrations/uptake and local hy­
drodynamic conditions. This study clarifies a controversial relationship
found in the literature, but caution is still needed when generalising the
non-significant effect of fish biomass, to locations with localised
dynamics.
