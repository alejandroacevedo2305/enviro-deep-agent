UV Activated-carbon All-in-one

Machine

###### UV Photolysis + Activated-carbon All-in-one Facility (Customized Color)

The principle of UV photolysis + activated-carbon all-in-one facility is to, by means of applying high-energy
and high-ozone UV ultraviolet beams to irradiate organic waste-gas and malodorous gas to change their molecular
chain structures for making these harmful gas transform into non-harmful or slight harmful chemical compounds,
like CO2 and H2O.

Activated-carbon adsorption tower is a type of professional purifying equipment for disposing organic exhaust
gases and odors. The product is developed based on the fact that larger organic molecules, aromatic compounds,
halogenated alkyne and other similar materials can firmly adsorbed on activated-carbon surfaces or voids and
achieve obvious removal effects on humic substances and organic matters.
Application Scope: Thermal Power Plant, Cigarettes Manufacturing Plants, Textile Mills. Printing Plants, Paper
Mill, Steel Mill, Cement Plant, Chemical Plant, Pharmaceutical Plant, Cigarettes Manufacturing Plants, Flavors &
Fragrances Plant, Furniture Factory, Hospital, Restaurant, Hotel, Entertainment Venue, as well as Public Places,
such as Office and Lab;
