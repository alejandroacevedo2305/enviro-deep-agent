# Description of CATALYTIC CARBON [®]

 - **CATALYTIC CARBON** **[®]** is Coconut carbon

 - **CATALYTIC CARBON** **[®]** is Certified by WQA to NSF/ANSI 61 Standard

 - **CATALYTIC CARBON** **[®]** is Catalyzed with Iron (“Catalytic ­Structure”)

 - Iron Catalyst has the highest Oxidation and ­Adsorption pores “Inside

as well as Outside the ­Activated Carbon”

 - Surface of **CATALYTIC CARBON** **[®]** ranging from 2000 m [2] /g to 2500 m [2] /g

Iron Particles coated inside and outside the micro-pores of **CATALYTIC**
**­CARBON** **[®]** eliminates the need of expensive Ion-­Exchange and Membrane
­Process to remove contaminants such as

 - Suspended Solids ≤ 1 micron

 - Humic Substances (organics)

 - Tannins and Lignin

# Removal of tannins

Includine humic acid, fulvic acid and major
­constituents of natural organic matters. Humic
substrances with chlorine produce desinfection by
products such as **Trihalomethanes** (THMs). Other
problems are the transport of hydrophobic organic
contaminants and the bind heavy metals with them.
A very big problem with organics are bacterial
growth in water distribution systems by serving as
food source that induce unpleasant taste and color
in drinking water. **CATALYTIC CARBON** **[®]** from Watch
Water [ ®] can remove tannins, humic substances and
can be regenerated (adsorption) for next effective
treatment process. ­Regeneration cycle is short and

very easy.

Watch Water [®] **CATALYTIC CARBON** **[®]** is made

of coconut shells. Carbon from coconut shell is

the most effective form. Activated Carbon used in
**CATALYTIC CARBON** **[®]** systems is a Granulated
Activated Carbon (GAC). Advanced Carbon
technology (Catalyzed Carbon by Watch Water [®] is
(highly activated) by coating a positive (+) charge
which enhances the adsoprtion of contaminants
that have negative charge. **CATALYTIC CARBON** **[®]**
made by Watch Water [®] is an advanced Activated
Carbon product designed to adsorb very high level
of chloramines. Chloramines replace chlorine in
the disinfection process and form Trihalomethanes
(THMs) - a cancer causing substance.

# Chlorine Chloramines THMs

# How does the CATALYTIC CARBON [®] work?

**CATALYTIC CARBON** **[®]** offers better than any
applied convetional method a way to remove humic
substances which generates a large volume of
wastewater. Using Watch Water [ ®] **CATALYTIC**
**CARBON** **[®]** coated with iron-hydroxide, has huge
capacitiy for humic substances, phosphates,
copper and many other heavy metals (read on page
one). Humic substances are negatively charged

**www.watchwater.de**

at circumceutral pH conditions due to prevalence
of carboxyl and phenol groups on their surface.
Adsorption of humic substances, however is possible
on surfyce chemistry, surface modification of
activated carbon with iron-hydroxite coating that
generates very strong positively charged **CATALYTIC**
**CARBON** **[®]** - leading to the most favorable surface
interactions between them.

# Surface Chemistry

High oxygen on surface of Activated Carbon is the
most important factor which influence its surface
characteristics. To achieve these, the surface
has to be treated in a very special way. The larger
oxygen content the higher the hydrophilic character
of the carbon surface. Watch Water [ ®] treatment

gives an activated carbon a unique acid-base
characteristiques.

# Increase of Activity

In a heterogeneous **CATALYTIC CARBON** **[®]**, many
reactions proceed on the surface of the Catalyst. To
increase the catalytic efficiency, it is essential to make
the surface area ey large as possible. When iron-oxide
is used as catalyst it is coated from 20 to 50 nm
and distributed on the porous supports with a pore
structure and the largest surface area for reaction,
and this increases the catalytic activity per unit weight.

# System design with Watch Water [ ®] ­CATALYTIC CARBON [®]

Standard filtration rate is recommended to

set at max. 40 BV / hour to provide 90 seconds
contact time (recommended minimum) to yield good
results. Te required filtration rate viries according to

the inlet water constituen. Pilot test is recommended

for industrial applications, wastewater treatment and
other critical waters. The table below to realize the

expected water quality from different filtration rate:

# Regeneration of Spent Activated Carbon

Superoxide Systems a very simple a) Brine Tank with b) Brine
Wall and a control valve, same as water softener, can be used to
apply this very unique technology to Regenerate contaminated
**CATALYTIC CARBON** **[®]** and re-activate it up to 99%. Desorption
and Destruction of all organics and adsorbed heavy metals can be
achieved by 1% strength solution of **OXYDES-P** (Catalyzed Super
Oxide). Catalyzed Super Oxide reactions are based on Fenton’s
like reaction which generates hydroxyl radicals (•OH). These
Hydroxyl radicals are so strong that it oxidizes all possible organics
from the surface of Activated Carbon.

**CATALYTIC CARBON** **[®]** is re-activated and is like brand new Carbon

the total amount of regeneration is as the following cycles:

1. Backwash - 5 minutes

2. Suction of regenerator ( **OXYDES-P** ) - 15 minutes
3. Fast rinse - 10 minutes

4. Back to service

**NOTE:** The regeneration is every six
month and the solution is prepared
fresh just before the regeneration.
**OXYDES-P** can be used for regenerating also for normal Activated
Carbon media.

**Catalytic Carbon activation during first time installation:**

Activation of corrosion on Catalytic Carbon's surfaces is recommended. For activation 1 table spoon of salt is required for each bag of Catalytic Carbon (30 liter).
During first time installation after loading Catalytic Carbon in vessel soak the Catalytic Carbon for 45 minutes by adding required amount of table salt. Once the
soaking process is finish, perform the backwash for minimum around 20 minutes or until backwash water is clear.
