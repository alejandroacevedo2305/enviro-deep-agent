# 0 Introduction

**0.1** **Purpose and target group**

The Netherlands Emission Guidelines for Air

( _Nederlandse emissierichtlijn lucht_, NeR) are intended
for all competent authorities, such as municipalities
and provinces, but also companies, consultancies and
private individuals. The purpose of the NeR is to
harmonise the issuing of permits regulating emissions
to the air.

**0.2** **Legal status and policy**

**context**

The Environmental Protection Act ( _Wet milieubeheer_ )
determines that a permit is required to set up, operate,
or change an installation or its operation. The
Environmental Protection Installations and Permits

Decree ( _Inrichtingen- en vergunningenbesluit_
_Milieubeheer_ ) defines which installations must have
such a permit. In order to protect the environment, the
competent authorities attach rules to these permits.
These rules may relate to the protection of water, soil,
air, energy saving, hazard reduction or waste
prevention.

The NeR is intended to harmonise the issuing of
permits regulating emissions to the air. The NeR has
been drafted by the joint authorities - provinces,
municipalities and the national government - and does
not have a legal status. The Council of State
jurisprudence shows that the courts regard the NeR as
an important guideline for the competent authorities
so that any departure from it must be adequately
explained.

**0.3** **Background of the NeR**
**system**

The NeR system is based on general standards for
emission concentrations which are in accordance with

Best Available Control Technology for reducing
emissions. Furthermore, it contains exclusion
provisions for specific activities and branches of
industry. In the NeR these are called special
regulations.

The general concentration standards are given for each
substance or class of substances. In most cases a

threshold value is also provided, indicating that the
emission is so large that the implementation of
measures should be considered. This threshold value is

called the mass flow limit. The concentrations given in
the NeR are upper limits for the concentration in the
waste gas flow of a specific relevant source.

As well as the general concentration standards, the
NeR also stipulates different types of standards for
specific processes, for example, a standard regarding the
absolute amount of a particular emission, the
application of a particular technology or the
maintaining of a certain distance. This depends on the
specific activity or industry.

The emission standards in the NeR are meant to be

used as the basis for performance specifications in
environmental permits. It is also possible to specify
implementation measures with which these targets can
be achieved or process-integrated measures which may
lead to a similar environmental result.

**0.4** **How to read this document**

Chapter  guides the reader in eight steps through the
NeR system. Clarifications of specific concepts are
given in separate explanatory notes with references to
sections in Chapter  which contain more information.
The structure of Chapter  corresponds as closely as
possible to a permit application procedure.

Chapter  considers the system and background of the
NeR in more detail. It gives additional information to
that in Chapter  and must be read in combination
with Chapters  and .

Chapter  contains specific information on the
standards that emissions must comply with. The
general standards are given in §. and the special
regulations concerning specific processes or industries
are given in §., §. and §.. Chapter  contains the
appendices to the NeR.

The background and the aims of the various sections
are clarified in the explanatory notes placed in the text.
These clarifications are an integral part of the NeR.

**0.5** **Structure of the NeR**
**organisation and the**
**authorisation process**

The NeR was prepared by the NeR Advisory Group
(formerly the ). This consultative body is composed
of representatives of government agencies (Association
of Provincial Authorities [], Association of
Netherlands Municipalities [], Ministry of
Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment

[] and the umbrellas for trade and industry

[-, , , ]). The Advisory Group
discusses proposals for the content of the NeR and
gives advice to the Company-oriented Environmental
Policy Steering Group, a committee under the .
In the  (Directorate-General for Environmental
Protection [], Association of Waterboards [Unie
van Waterschappen],  and ) the joint authorities
then establish the NeR at the administrative level.

The NeR Secretariat is part of InfoMil. InfoMil
provides for the publication and updating of the NeR
under the responsibility of the NeR Authorisation
Committee.

Both the draft version and the final version were
prepared in close consultation with the abovementioned organisations.
Even though representatives of trade and industry are
closely involved in the preparation of the NeR, they are
not responsible for the authorisation of the NeR.

**Providing information on and updating the NeR**
The InfoMil Helpdesk provides general information
on the NeR. InfoMil also provides general information
on control options and best available techniques to
public authorities, companies and third parties. To
facilitate a uniform implementation of the NeR, the
NeR Secretariat regularly publishes a compilation of
the questions asked of InfoMil and the answers to
them. If InfoMil observes bottlenecks with respect to
the interpretation of the NeR in practice, it advises the
NeR Advisory Group to clarify the NeR on these
points.

If future jurisprudence shows that there are departures
from the original intentions of the NeR, the NeR
organisation will, if necessary, introduce changes in the
text and/or content.

**Procedure for adding to or changing the NeR**
Anyone may submit a request for changing or adding
to the NeR to the NeR Advisory Group (e.g. for
making a special regulation). This request must be sent
to: NeR Secretariat, c/o InfoMil, .. Box ,
