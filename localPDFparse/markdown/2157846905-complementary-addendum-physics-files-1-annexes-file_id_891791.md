### effectiveness methodology

**4.13.1 The methodology**

**4.13.1.1** **Introduction**

In essence, the cost effectiveness methodology
standardises the calculation of the cost and the effect of

an environmental measure irrespective of the internal
cost figures applied by the company itself. Its value lies
in the ability to compare the calculated cost
effectiveness with the indicative reference values and to

evaluate the measures themselves.

The methodology used to calculate cost effectiveness is
shown in figure . The following sections consider the
various aspects of the figure. The methodology was
developed primarily to calculate the cost effectiveness
of end-of-pipe measures to reduce , particulates,
 x and   emissions into the atmosphere.

The calculation is made using a draft design of a
selected measure. The draft design must generate all
the information necessary to calculate cost
effectiveness. In principle, draft designs incorporate
measures that will comply with (non-binding)
guidelines on the state of the art. The draft design
should be provided by the company itself and assessed
by the competent authority. Cost effectiveness may be
calculated by either the company or the competent
authority. The costs in a draft design may also be
derived from the competent authority’s own
calculations.

For special situations that are not described in the
method, reference is made to §...

**4.13.1.2** **Interest rate and depreciation**
The result of a cost calculation is highly dependent on
the interest rate used. In the methodology, a fixed
interest rate is applied of %. This % is a
compromise between the nominal capital market
interest rates and the internal rate of interest used by
companies (the return on investment).

**4.13.1.3** **Depreciation method**
In the methodology, investments are depreciated on an
annuity basis. In principle, there are two methods of
depreciation: straight-line and annuity. In practice
investments are often depreciated on a straight-line
basis. The annuity method, however, has the advantage
that the annual charge is constant, making the
methodology easier to use.

**4.13.1.4** **Depreciation period**
The following depreciation periods are applied in the
methodology:

-  years for the electro-mechanical part of the
environmental investment;

-  years for the structural part of the environmental

investment.

The electro-mechanical part of the investment
comprises all equipment, complete with
instrumentation and the like. The structural part
includes halls, sheds, foundations, pipe bridges and the
like. These structural investments are depreciated over
a longer period because their lives are usually longer
than ten years and they often remain in service after the
original equipment is replaced. In practice, however, at
least part of a structural investment is specific to the
equipment and has to be removed when the equipment
is written off, dismantled or taken out of service. If this
is foreseen, such equipment-specific structures should
be included in the electro-mechanical part of the
investment and depreciated over ten years.

**4.13.1.5** **Annuity calculation**
The annuity is a factor that expresses the annual cost of
a non-recurring investment. The annuity is calculated
from the interest rate plus depreciation as follows:

i*( + i) [n]

Annuity =
( + i) [n] -

where i is the interest rate (dimensionless) and n is the
depreciation period (in years). With an interest rate of
% (i = .), the annuity is . at a depreciation
period of ten years and . at a depreciation period of

 years.

The depreciation period commences the moment the
equipment is taken into service. The cost of capital
incurred before that moment is included in the non
recurring investments as ‘interest costs during
construction’.

Duration of malfunctions and maintenance: 2% of operating time

 - Additional and non-recurring investment costs and fixed operating costs should preferably be derived from the draft design.

The default values should be used only if the results of the draft design are not reliable.

**4.13.2 Definition and explanation**
**of terms**

**4.13.2.1** **Cost price**
The price that is paid to the supplier of the technique
or to component suppliers. If a measure has not yet
been implemented, the cost price together with the
other investments and the operating costs is calculated
in a cost engineering study. In such a study, the
equipment used to achieve an emission reduction is
scaled up to its true size before the costs are calculated.

**4.13.2.2** **Additional and non-recurring**
**investments**

Additional investments are the extra costs that are

incurred to build the measure into the process. They
include all manner of hardware: instrumentation,
electrical connections and fittings, other utility fittings,
pipelines, ducts and stacks, insulation and assembly.
Structural investments made specifically for the
measure are also included as additional investments. In

part, the additional investments are specific to the
situation and are determined by the ease with which
the technique can be incorporated.

The additional investments should relate to the

environmental measure only.

Non-recurring investments are the other costs that are
necessary to bring the equipment into operation. They
include engineering costs (including design and
management during construction), fees and research
costs for licensing procedures, interest costs during
construction, notary fees, start-up costs and
miscellaneous operating costs during the first year.

**Table 2** **The non-depreciated part of a non-environmental**

**investment**

In practice, the additional investments are difficult to
predict but may have a significant impact on cost
effectiveness. The sum of the additional and non
recurring investments varies from % to % of cost
price. This figure is determined chiefly by the degree to
which the existing equipment and other facilities (for
example buildings) need to be modified for the end-ofpipe technique and the complexity of the equipment
(measurement and control equipment, etc.).
Table  provides a possible indication for use if the
draft design is not sufficiently reliable.

**Table 1** **Additional and non-recurring investments in**
**representative situations**

**4.13.2.4** **Structural investments**

Structural investments include halls, sheds,
outbuildings, foundations, pipe bridges and the like
insofar as they are not specifically built for the
environmental equipment. Equipment-specific
structural investments are classified as additional
investments.

**4.13.2.5** **Fixed operating costs**
These are principally maintenance and service costs
(including overhead) and insurance.

**4.13.2.6** **Variable operating costs**
These are supply- and concentration-dependent costs
such as auxiliary materials, utilities and residue
processing. The variable costs are calculated for the
maximum licensed operating time and capacity. Since
the methodology is based on the cost of an
environmental measure, standard utility charges are
used wherever possible, as stated in the annual 
publication ().

**4.13.2.3** **Extra depreciation of assets through**
**disinvestment**

If the environmental measure makes certain process
equipment or components redundant, must be
depreciated as disinvestment. The extra depreciation is
equal to the residual value of the material written off
prematurely. This is applicable only in the case of nonenvironmental investments. Premature depreciation of
environmental investments is considered in §....

The extra depreciation is based on the total investment
(the sum of cost price, additional investments and nonrecurring investments) and the age of the assets
prematurely written off. If the investment is older than
ten years, the disinvestment is equal to nil. If the assets
are younger than ten years, the extra depreciation
through disinvestment is determined on the basis of
table .

**4.13.2.7** **Revenues and savings**
This includes the expenditure that is avoided by
implementing the measure, such as avoided
environmental taxes, safety measures, maintenance,
and consumption of raw materials and auxiliary
materials. In addition, by-products may generate
revenues, such as steam from heat recovery from afterburning or gypsum, sulphur or sulphuric acid from a
desulphurisation plant.

**4.13.2.8** **Unabated emission**

This is the emission in kg per annum that would be
discharged if the abatement technique were not
implemented. This emission is calculated for the
maximum permitted operating time and capacity
because the emission-reducing technique will be
designed for this maximum.

If a measure has already been implemented, the
unabated emission can be quantified, for example on
the basis of:

- The emission before the measure is implemented if
this is known from measurements and the

production process has not changed significantly
since the measurements were taken.

- The mass flow before the emission-reducing
measure, if known.

- A mass balance. The use of solvents may be an
indication of the  emission if no measure were

taken. The sulphur content of the fuel may give an
indication of the unabated   emission.

- The consumption of auxiliary chemicals. The
quantity of calcium used, for example, may give an
indication of the quantity of   removed.

- The quantity of separated residues, for example the
volume of filtered particulates.

If a measure still has to be implemented, the unabated
emission can be estimated on the basis of:

- Recent emission measurements.

- The current, licensed emission.

- Comparable process equipment in operation
elsewhere (with or without the emission-reducing
technique).

- Figures agreed with the company (if otherwise not
available or for new installations).

**4.13.2.9** **Remaining emission**
This is the emission in kg per annum following the
implementation of a measure. It is determined from
the licensed emission and the maximum licensed

operating time and capacity or from measurement
results (if lower than the licensed remaining emission).
If production continues during maintenance or
malfunctions of the environmental measure, the
additional emissions during maintenance and
malfunction are added to the emission discharged
during normal operation. The duration of
maintenance and malfunctions is taken to be set in the

permit or based on the experience or estimates of the
supplier. If such information is not available, % of the
operating time may be used. This is relevant only if
production can continue during maintenance and
malfunction.

**4.13.3 Calculations in exceptional**

**cases**

**4.13.3.1** **Safety measures**
Safety measures are generally not regarded as
‘environmental measures’ in this methodology. If a
safety measure has to be introduced for the
implementation of an environmental measure,
however, it is regarded as part of the environmental
measure. If an environmental measure makes a safety
measure redundant, a saving might be realised. If
hardware that is not yet written off becomes
redundant, there is an extra depreciation of assets
through disinvestment. A reduction in the operating
cost of safety measures also represents a saving.

**4.13.3.2** **Additional and replacement**
**investments**

The  principle, which is embedded in Dutch
environmental law, requires periodic checks to be made
whether the standards set for the processes and the
environmental measures are still in agreement with the
latest knowledge and technical developments. If the
competent authority believes an existing
environmental measure is no longer adequate, the
existing measure should be improved or replaced by a
more reasonable measure. In such cases, both a
marginal and a total cost effectiveness can be
calculated. The marginal cost effectiveness is calculated
using the additional cost and the additional effect. The
total cost effectiveness is calculated using the total cost
and the total effect. The terms additional costs and

additional effects are illustrated in figure .

Effect of existing Effect of improvement Effect of
measures to existing measures replacement

_Existing measure_
The cost of an existing measure is the sum of the
operating cost and the cost of capital. If the existing
measure is less than ten years old, the cost of capital is
the product of the annuity and the original investment,
adjusted for inflation by means of price indices in the
 price book (). If the existing measure is older
than ten years, the cost of capital is equal to nil.

_Improving an existing measure_
An existing measure may be improved by either
upgrading it (for example introducing an additional
filter chamber) or by implementing an additional
measure that raises the overall environmental

performance of a particular component (for example a
fabric filter behind a cyclone). On the improvement of
an existing measure, the marginal cost is equal to the
sum of the cost of capital and the operating costs
incurred to improve the measure. The marginal effect
is the effect attributable to the improvement. Marginal
cost effectiveness is the quotient of these two. The total
cost is the sum of the cost of the existing measure plus
the cost of the additional measure. The total effect is

the sum of the effects of the existing and of the
additional measure. Total cost effectiveness is the

quotient of the total effect and the total cost.

_Replacement measure_
The total cost of a replacement measure is the sum of
the cost of capital, the operating cost for the
replacement measure and the disinvestment. The
calculation of extra depreciation through disinvestment
is considered in §.... The total effect is the effect
attributable to the replacement measure. Total cost
effectiveness is the quotient of total cost and total
effect.

_Marginal cost effectiveness_
Marginal cost is the difference between the total cost of
the replacement measure and that of the existing
measure. The marginal effect is the difference between
the effect of the replacement measure and that of the
existing measure. Marginal cost effectiveness is the
quotient of marginal cost and marginal effect.

_Marginal or total cost effectiveness?_
Both marginal and total cost effectiveness have to be
taken into account in practice. Since the elimination of
a relatively small remaining emission is relatively
expensive, marginal cost effectiveness is less favourable
in many cases than total cost effectiveness. If a measure
is assessed using the indicative reference values, its
marginal cost effectiveness may not be acceptable even
though its total cost effectiveness is acceptable. Since
the indicative reference values (§..) are not suitable
to assess marginal cost effectiveness, a separate method
has been developed for improvement and replacement
measures. The method is described below.

_Method to assess the marginal cost effectiveness_
There are two steps in a decision to improve or replace
an existing measure:
. Assess the acceptability of total cost effectiveness.
The total cost effectiveness of an improvement or
replacement measure is assessed using the indicative
reference value (§..). This assessment determines
whether the total cost effectiveness is acceptable or not.

. Assess marginal cost effectiveness.
If the total cost effectiveness is acceptable, the new
measure’s marginal cost effectiveness can then be
assessed. The marginal cost effectiveness will in general
be less favourable than the total cost effectiveness. If

the marginal cost effectiveness is acceptable, the
measure is considered to be acceptable.
The lower acceptable value for marginal cost
effectiveness has been set at . times the indicative
reference value (§..). The upper value is  times the
indicative reference value. These values, though,
should be used cautiously. If the cost effectiveness lies
between the two values, a measure may be postponed
for a number of years to compensate a company for
equipment becoming redundant. The number of years’
postponement will depend on the age of the existing
measure, as shown in table . The number of years’
postponement is calculated from the moment at which
a new measure can be considered state of the art. This

moment can be derived from documents that describe

the best available technique (for example the NeR or
the European s).

**Table 3** **Determination of the number of years’**
**postponement if marginal cost effectiveness is**
**between 1.5 and 4 times the indicative reference**

**value**

If the environmental measure is new, only the total cost
effectiveness needs to be assessed against the indicative
reference value. However, if several alternative
environmental measures have only small differences in
their environmental impact but significant cost
differences, an additional evaluation of marginal cost
effectiveness may be worthwhile, as it is with existing
measures. The assessment of the marginal cost
effectiveness is made using only the reference of four
times the indicative reference value since a new

measure cannot be postponed.

Figure  summarises the considerations schematically.
Ultimately, one of three conclusions will be drawn:

- the improvement or replacement measure is
acceptable and the measure is not postponed;

- the improvement or replacement measure is
postponed to compensate the company for the extra
depreciation of assets (applies only to existing
equipment);

- the measure is not acceptable; the decision-making
process is continued as shown in figure , §..
(.. This is not a postponement).

**Figure 5** **Decision-making process for additional and**
**replacement investments**

where TC A is the total cost that can be allocated to the
reduction of component A (in Euros); TC is the total
cost of the measure (in Euros); Q A and Q B are the
quantitative reduction in A and B emissions
respectively (both in kg); and wf A and wf B are the
weightings for A and B respectively (dimensionless).

The cost effectiveness of reducing component A
emissions (in euros per kg) can then be calculated as:

TC
A
CE A =
Q A

The weightings are based on the emission limit values
stated in the NeR. The adoption of these limit values
took account of the components’ toxicological and
other environmental impacts. The advantage of this is
that it allows relevant emissions to be weighted. In
practice, if component A ’s emission limit value is four
times lower than component B ’s, the reduction of
emissions of substance A is weighted four times as
heavily. The dimensionless weighting, wf, is defined as
one hundred divided by the emission limit value as
formulated in the NeR. Table  shows a number of
weightings.

The proportion of the total cost that must be allocated
to reducing one of several components can be
calculated using the following formula:

Q A *wf A
TC A = - TC
Q A *wf A + Q B *wf B

**Table 4** **Weightings**

**4.13.3.3** **Cross-media effects**

Most environmental measures have a greater impact on
the environment than the effect for which they were
designed and implemented. The basic rule in this
methodology is that account is taken only of the effect
for which the environmental measure is implemented.
Other effects are not considered unless a measure is

explicitly designed to reduce emissions of more than one
component. In this case, an allocation method is used to
calculate cost effectiveness.

Weightings are introduced to aggregate the different
types of chemical substances. The weightings discount
the fact that a reduction in the emission of component
A by one kilogram is worth more than a reduction in
the emission of the less harmful component B by one
kilogram or less.

The physical or economic background to this
weighting method is limited. The weightings are
therefore used only to determine what proportion of
the cost can be attributed to reducing emissions of
component A and B .

**4.13.3.4** **Simultaneous environmental and**
**non-environmental impact**
In some cases a measure may have both an
environmental impact and a non-environmental
impact. The second impact may relate to, for example,
working conditions or safety. In such cases, the
measure cannot be treated solely as an environmental
measure; part of it must be treated as working
conditions or safety measure.
To separate the environmental investment from the
non-environmental investment, a theoretical
minimum working conditions or safety measure must
be defined in order to determine its cost. This
minimum other cost is deducted from the total cost to

produce the environmental cost.

**4.13.3.5** **Capacity changes after**
**implementation of an environmental**

**measure**

An increase or decrease in a process’s actual production
volume in the period in which a measure is in
operation will not influence the cost effectiveness
calculated using this methodology since both the
emission and the measure are extrapolated for the
maximum licensed capacity.

If the licensed capacity changes in the period in which
a measure is in operation, cost effectiveness will be
influenced. Both the unabated emission and the
emission after implementation of the measure are
calculated for the capacity permitted under the new
licence. If capacity increases on account of a new
production line coming on stream, environmental
measures can be introduced for that line. In such cases,

the measures’ cost effectiveness is calculated on the cost

and effect of that production line.

**4.13.3.6** **Process-integrated measures**
Calculating the cost effectiveness of a processintegrated measure is more problematic since it is
difficult to discern the specific environmental costs and
benefits of process integrated measures. More
exceptions will also have to be allowed for. In many
cases, a measure will be introduced for nonenvironmental reasons or capacity changes may be
introduced simultaneously. In principle, the
methodology described above is also appropriate for
process-integrated measures. It should be noted,
though, that neither the methodology nor the
indicative reference values have been adequately tested
for such measures.
