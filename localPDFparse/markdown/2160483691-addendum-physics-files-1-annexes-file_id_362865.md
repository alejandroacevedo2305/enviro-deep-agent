##### For full text of abbreviations: see SECTION 16. SECTION 4: First aid measures 4.1 Description of first aid measures General notes

##### If irritation or symptoms occur from any route of exposure, remove the affected individual from the area. Remove contamin- ated clothing and launder before reuse. In all cases of doubt, or when symptoms persist, seek medical advice. Following inhalation If inhalation causes irritation, remove to fresh air. If symptoms persist, get medical advice/attention. Following skin contact Wash with plenty of soap and water. Following eye contact Get immediate medical attention. Immediately flush eyes with plenty of clean water. Remove contact lenses if present and easy to do so. Continue flushing eyes with water for an extended time, not less than fifteen (15) minutes. Flush longer if there is any indication of residual chemical in the eye. Ensure adequate flushing of the eyes by separating the eyelids with fingers and roll eyes in a circular motion. .

## Rinse mouth with water. Do NOT induce vomiting. Get medical attention. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 4.2 Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed Dermal contact may temporarily discolor skin due to dye characteristics. 4.3 Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed None known. Treat symptomatically. SECTION 5: Firefighting measures 5.1 Extinguishing media
### Suitable extinguishing media

## In case of fire use water fog, foam, carbon dioxide (CO2), dry chemical.

### Unsuitable extinguishing media

## Do not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this will spread the fire. 5.2.1 Hazardous combustion products Nitrogen oxides (NOx). Carbon monoxide (CO). Carbon dioxide (CO2). Sulphur oxides (SOx). Irritating or toxic substances may be emitted upon burning, combustion or decomposition. 5.3 Advice for firefighters In case of fire and/or explosion do not breathe fumes. Co-ordinate firefighting measures to the fire surroundings. Do not al- low firefighting water to enter drains or water courses. Collect contaminated firefighting water separately. Fight fire with nor- mal precautions from a reasonable distance. SECTION 6: Accidental release measures 6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures Remove persons to safety. Follow emergency procedures such as the need to evacuate the area, notify authorities or to con- sult an expert. Keep unnecessary personnel away. Wear personal protective equipment to prevent injury. See section 8 of this SDS. Ensure adequate ventilation. 6.2 Environmental precautions Do not flush product down drains that discharge into public sewer systems. Do not pour onto the ground. Do not release into surface waters such as lakes, rivers and streams. Dispose of unusable product, wash water, and contaminated materials properly. See section 13 for disposal considerations. 6.3 Methods and materials for containment and cleanup Cover floor drains. Prevent spilled material from leaving the area if safe to do so. Collect spill using an absorbent material. Suitable absorbent material(s) include: Kieselgur (diatomite). Sawdust. Sand. Universal binder. Collect spilled material and place into suitable container(s) for reuse or disposal. Label containers appropriately. Other information relating to spills and releases Place in appropriate containers for disposal. Ventilate affected area. 6.4 Reference to other sections Hazardous combustion products: see section 5. Personal protective equipment: see section 8. Incompatible materials: see section 10. Disposal considerations: see section 13. SECTION 7: Handling and storage 7.1 Precautions for safe handling Recommendations Measures to prevent fire as well as aerosol and dust generation Use local and general ventilation. Use only in well-ventilated areas. Advice on general occupational hygiene Wash hands after use. Do not eat, drink and smoke in work areas. Remove contaminated clothing and protective equipment before entering eating areas. Never keep food or drink in the vicinity of chemicals. Never place chemicals in containers that are normally used for food or drink. Keep away from food, drink and animal feedingstuffs. 7.2 Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities Managing of associated risks Explosive atmospheres Store in a closed container.
