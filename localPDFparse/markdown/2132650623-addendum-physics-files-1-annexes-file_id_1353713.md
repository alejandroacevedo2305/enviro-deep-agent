10 **CS-423E** specifications

### Transmission

Two variable displacement piston
pumps supply pressurized flow to two
dual displacement piston motors. One
pump and motor drives the drum propel
system while the other pump and motor
drives the rear wheels.

The two-pump system ensures equal
flow to the drive motors regardless of
the operating conditions. In case the
drum or wheels lose traction, the other
motor can still build additional pressure
to provide added torque.

The drive motors have two swashplate
positions allowing operation at either
maximum torque for compaction and
gradeability or maximum speed for
moving around the job site. A rocker
switch at the operator’s console triggers
an electric over hydraulic control to
change speed ranges.

Speed changes can be made without
stopping. A single propel lever located
on the control console provides smooth
hydrostatic control of the machine’s
infinitely variable speeds in both
forward and reverse.

**Speeds (forward and reverse):**

Low range 5.5 km/h

High range 11.5 km/h
