**COPPER PYRITHIONE: AQUACULTURE UPDATE**

On 03 October 2014 the Biocidal Products Committee adopted the opinion for approval of
Copper Pyrithione in product type 21 (Antifouling Products). The BPC Opinion includes the use of
the active substance to impregnate fishing nets. Thus, the opinion makes way for supplying the
market with an effective active ingredient for the treatment of fishing nets.

The risk to human health following net coating and deployment was assessed during the review
and considered acceptable. Notably, appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) needs to
be used. The emission scenario and models required for environmental safety assessment have
since been finalized and are now available for product authorisation. Based on the current
understanding, environmental exposure is expected to be acceptable following evaluation at
product authorisation stage.

On 24 June 2015 the European Commission approved Copper Pyrithione as an existing active
substance for use in biocidal products for product type 21. Applications for products containing
already on the market, including fish net impregnation products, will need to be submitted to
member states before formal approval takes effect. For products containing Copper Pyrithione
only the formal approval date is 01 October 2016. New products, meaning products that were not
on the market before the approval of the active substance, will need to be authorized by member
states before being placed on the market.

Please do not hesitate to contact us in case there are any further questions or comments on the
Copper Pyrithione BPC opinion, inclusion decision or on the product authorisation process.
