### Storage system safety features

Vertical installation of pressure cylinders

Connection pipes/cylinders on top of system

System devided in three independend sections
each section has 36 x cylinders (see P&ID)

Each section has a 500 bar safety relief valve (see P&ID)

Deflector shield on pipes /cylinder connection to
guide possible jet stream to the top side

Pipe connections = orbital welding (with some exceptions)

Top side protected with open metal grid

UV Protection with large gaps
to allow free air flow from bottom

to top

Final acceptance test with european
notified body
