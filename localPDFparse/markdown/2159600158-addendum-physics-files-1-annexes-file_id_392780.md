**As fine particle (FP) pollution is harmful to humans, previous studies have focused on the mechanisms**
**of FP removal by forests. The current study aims to compare the FP removal capacities of urban**
**forests and wetlands on the leaf, canopy, and landscape scales. Water washing and scanning electron**
**microscopy are used to calculate particle accumulation on leaves, and models are used to estimate**
**vegetation collection, sedimentation, and dry deposition. Results showed that, on the leaf scale, forest**
**species are able to accumulate more FP on their leaf surface than aquatic species in wetlands. On the**
**canopy scale, horizontal vegetation collection is the major process involved in FP removal, and the**
**contribution of vertical sedimentation/emission can be ignored. Coniferous tree species also showed**
**stronger FP collection ability than broadleaf species. In the landscape scale, deposition on the forest**
**occurs to a greater extent than that on wetlands, and dry deposition is the major process of FP removal**
**on rain-free days. In conclusion, when planning an urban green system, planting an urban forest should**
**be the first option for FP mitigation.**

Particulate matter (PM) is considered with aerodynamic diameters equal to or less than 10 μm while fine particles
(FP) refer to particulates with an aerodynamic diameter range of 0.2-2.5 μm [1] ; they contain highly toxic components, such as heavy metals and potential carcinogens [2,3], and can be inhaled into the bronchus and deep lungs [4],
causing alveolar inflammation. In recent years, particles have led to hazy weather in many cities in China [5-7] . Thus,
determining an effective way to reduce particle concentrations in urban areas has become a crucial endeavor.
Urban green systems, including urban forests, wetlands, and green belts, have gained recognition for their contribution to air cleaning [3], and relevant studies have mainly focused on the leaf, canopy, and landscape scales to
estimate the roles of plants and urban green systems in particle removal.
Foliage surfaces are an important research hotspot because these surfaces can capture and accumulate PM.
While plants are considered excellent biological filters [6,8-13], different species show varying accumulation abilities.
For example, a Polish study indicated that _Syringa meyeri_ presents the strongest PM capturing ability out of all
commonly planted urban trees tested [10] . In Norway, research has indicated that _Betula pendula_, _Pinus mugo_, _Pinus_
_sylvestris_, and _Salix cinerea_ show higher annual PM accumulation than other commonly cultivated species in urban
areas [12] . Furthermore, research in Beijing, China, has demonstrated that while _Cephalotaxus sinensis_, _Euonymus_
_japonicas_, _Broussonetia papyriferar_, _Koelreuteria paniculata_, and _Quercus variabilis_ can efficiently capture particles [6], these plants are not commonly selected afforestation species in the studied area. Varying PM accumulation
abilities are related to the surface properties, hair density [12], number of stoma [6], growing stage [14], presence or absence
of a thin film, and number of tubules on a leaf’s surface [9] . Unfortunately, previous studies have only focused on
forest species and ignored hydrophytes in wetlands, which also feature high PM accumulation potential.
On the canopy scale, tree belts have been reported to block FP and reduce its concentration in both the vertical and horizontal directions [7,15-18] . FP is collected by vegetation through impaction, interception, and sedimentation [19] . Studies in central Shanghai, China, have shown that FP concentrations decrease with increasing
tree height in urban street canyons and that the rate of decrease in green streets is higher than that in tree-free
streets [16] . Results of simulated experiments have shown that the FP collection speed of coniferous trees is about
7.4 μg m [−][3] s [−][1] while that of broadleaf species can reach 33.5 μg m [−][3] s [−][1] in the full-leaf stage [15] . Contrasting with
these findings, research conducted next to a highway area in New York, USA, showed that the presence of a green
belt between the source and the downwind area reduces the frequency and intensity of concentration spikes but

that the average concentration and local FP concentration increase in relation to aerodynamics [20] . These differing
results could be related to the tree belt structure, such as the leaf area index, leaf area density distribution, trunk
height, tree-covered area, and tree planting pattern [21], and the monitoring distance from the tree belt. Thus, the
effect of tree belts in mitigating FP in a specific region requires further study.
Another research hotpot in FP removal involves effects on the landscape scale, which relates to dry deposition
onto forests, wetlands, and other land cover types [3,22-27] . Such research has recently been especially pertinent in
Beijing because of the presence of serious pollution within the city [7,28-31] . Results have determined that deposition
shows temporal variation and spatial heterogeneity. For example, FP deposition onto forests is higher than that on
wetlands [29], and the deposition velocity in coniferous forests is higher than that in broadleaf deciduous forests [31] .
Studies have also determined that the deposition velocity during the day is higher than that at night because
higher PM concentrations and the meteorological conditions, such as relatively higher humid and wind speed,
during the daytime are more favorable to dry deposition [7,29] .
Theoretical and monitoring research on different scales has expanded the scientific knowledge on the mechanisms and processes of FP removal by vegetation. However, practical application of scientific results to urban
design and planning is now necessary to mitigate serious pollution and improve air quality, particularly in urban
areas. Developing an optimized plan for a specific region that involves species selection and specific landscape
construction is thus essential and necessitates conducting comparative research by field investigations or model
simulations, using several alternative scenarios in the same pollutant background. The general lack of availability
of models to describe FP removal has been acknowledged. Thus, against this background, the aim of the present
work is to determine the most effective urban design scheme for FP removal in Beijing. Our study will (1) compare the FP leaf accumulation abilities of different forest and wetland species, (2) reveal the spatiotemporal heterogeneities in FP collection by vegetation in a green belt alongside a road on the individual scale, and (3) compare
FP dry deposition onto an urban forest and wetland on the landscape scale.

## Materials and Methods
### Experiment site. As shown in Fig. 1, the experimental sites are located in an artificial wetland, an artificial

forest, and a roadway in Beijing Olympic Forest Park, which is situated at the north end of the central axis of
Beijing and crossed by the Beijing 5 [th] Ring Road. Both the wetland and forest sites are far away from the Ring
Road to avoid the influence of traffic follow. The forest site is dominated by _Populus_ × _canadensis_ with some _Pinus_
_tabulaeformis_, _Morus alba, Quercus variabilis, Sophora japonica_, and _Gleditsia sinensis_, all of which are commonly
used species in urban planning in north China.
The average distance between two adjacent trees is about 10 m. The wetland consists of a lake with an herbaceous swamp on the shore containing _Phragmites australis_, _Scirpus validus_, _Typha orientalis_, _Lythrum salicaria_,
and _Iris_
spp. All of the species are randomly distributed throughout the forest and wetland. The roadway is located
to the north of the forest site. The main wind direction is from north to south, orthogonal to the roadway; thus,
the north side of the tree belt is defined as the windward side and the south side is considered the leeward side.
Roadside tree species include _Populus_ × _canadensis_ and _Sabina chinensis._

### Experimental design. This research aims to compare the abilities of forests and wetlands to remove FP on

the leaf, canopy, and landscape scales. To determine leaf-scale removal abilities, FP accumulation was compared
on the leaves of common forest tree species and aquatic plants in Beijing; to determine canopy-scale removal

abilities, vegetation accumulation and sedimentation/emission within the canopy of the forest site were calculated. Finally, to determine landscape-scale FP removal, dry deposition onto the forest and wetland was estimated
and compared. Vegetation collection within the wetland was ignored because of small plant sizes and the fact that
nearly no difference in FP concentration was determined at the top and bottom of plants. Vegetation collection
was thus compared between evergreen coniferous forest trees and deciduous broadleaf forest trees.
To evaluate leaf accumulation, six aquatic species and seven common tree species were selected. The aquatic
species include _P. australis_, _S. validus_, _Iris wilsonii_, _T. orientalis_, _Iris setosa_, and _L. salicaria_ ; and the tree species
include _M. alba, S. matsudana_, _Q. variabilis_, _Populus_ × _canadensis_, _S. japonica_, _G. sinensis_, and _S. chinensis._ All leaf
samples were collected twice a month from April 2014 to October 2014, and specific sampling days were decided
by the following weather conditions: 7 days after precipitation of more than 15 mm and no precipitation or strong
winds (wind speed >6 m/s) during the sampling week [11,32] . All of the sampled plants were in good condition with
little or no disease or pests. During sample collection of aquatic plants, the top leaves from all directions (north-,
south-, east-, and west-facing leaves), as well as tree species with a height of 6 m, which is the same height as the
FM monitors installed in the forest, were used as criteria. Leaf samples measured about 40 cm [2] in size, and 3-4
leaves were collected as one sample. Four samples were collected for each species, and all leaves were immediately
sealed in a plastic bag and stored in a refrigerator (5 °C).
During vegetation collection, as shown in Fig. 2B, FP concentration and meteorological data, including temperature, humidity, wind velocity, wind direction, and solar irradiance, were obtained from both sides of leaves
at the bottom (1.5 m), middle (3.5 m), and top (6 m) of the _S. chinensis_ and _Populus_ × _canadensis_ canopy along the
roadway. Concentration data were collected by DustMate (DUSTMATE, Turnkey Co. Ltd., United Kingdom)
monitors based on particle counters, and meteorological data were collected by portable weather instruments
(Kestrel 4000 Pocket Weather Meter, Nielsen-Kellerman Co. Ltd., USA). Both concentration and meteorological
data were automatically collected and recorded every 1 minute. We selected midsummer with lush vegetation
(June-August) and early winter after defoliation but no snow or frost (October-December) as experiment seasons, and randomly chose 6 rain-free days in each season. The instruments recorded continuous data for 24 hours
every sampling day (from 7:00 am of the sampling day to 7:00 am the next day), and each day was divided into
daytime (from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm) and nighttime. The DustMate monitors were calibrated twice a day (7:00 am
and 7:00 pm), and the sampling heads were washed by ultrasonic cleaning with deionized water three times before
each sampling.
Determinations of dry deposition were conducted in the forest site and wetland (Fig. 2A). Three heights of 6 m
(the average canopy height in the forest), 10 m, and 15 m were monitored in the forest, and another three heights
of 1.5 m (the average plant height in the wetland), 6 m, and 10 m were monitored in the wetland site. At each
height, a DustMate monitor and portable weather instrument were mounted on the trees. The sampling time and
period for dry deposition are identical to those applied during vegetation collection. In addition, an iron tower
with ultrasonic anemometers (Wind Master, Gill Instruments, United Kingdom) was constructed in the forest site
to obtain the Monine-Obukhov length and friction velocity. A wooden plant was also constructed in the wetland
center to enable installation of all of the equipment. All of the equipment was installed at the geometric center of
the forest and wetland, and no endangered or protected species were involved in the field studies.

### Data analysis. Leaf accumulation . The water washing method was performed to calculate particle accu
mulation on the surfaces and wax layers of leaves. Filters were weighed before and after FP removal and then
sorted using an electronic balance (BT125D, Sartorius Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) that was sensitive to 0.00001 g.
The filters were then placed in a polytetrafluoroethylene balancing box under constant temperature (25 °C) and
humidity (40%) for 48 h. The balancing box measured 80 cm × 80 cm × 80 cm. A balance and humidity controller (WHD48-11, ACREL Co., Ltd., Jiangsu, China) were also placed in the balancing box. A 100 cm [2] sample
from each species was clipped for washing in distilled water and chloroform to remove particles on the leaf surface and wax layer, respectively. The accumulation amount per unit area of each leaf was then used to compare

accumulation capacities among species. The washing liquid was filtered using filters with a pore diameter of 2.5 μ
m, collected, and then passed through filters with a pore diameter of 0.2 μm. The difference before and after filtration using the 0.2 μm filters was considered equal to the amount of FP collected.
Leaf samples were scanned using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S-3400N II, Hitachi Japan Co., Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan). Leaves were dehydrated using a dryer (DHG-9145A, Shanghai Yiheng Scientific Instrument Co.,
Ltd., Shanghai, China) at 60 °C for 48 h, cut into small strips (9 mm [2] ), and mounted on a sample stage. The strips
were photographed from different observation points on both the adaxial and abaxial surfaces at a magnification
range of ×370-750 SE.

#### Vegetation collection and sedimentation. In the horizontal direction within the canopy, interception and impac
tion are two major FP vegetation collection processes [7,19,29] . Brownian diffusion and rebound were ignored in this
research because we focused on particles ranging from 0.2 μm to 2.5 μm in size; Brownian diffusion affects very
FPs (usually smaller than 0.1 μm) and rebound influences coarse particle deposition at sizes typically larger than
5 μm. Thus, the total collection velocity may be calculated as the sum of the interception and impaction velocities
as follows

#### V C = V IN + V IM, (1) where V C (cm s [−][1] ) is the vegetation collection velocity and V IN (cm s [−][1] ) and V IM (cm s [−][1] ) are the collection veloc
ities associated with interception and impaction, respectively. These parameters are calculated as

#### V IN = C d ⋅ u(z) ⋅ E IN, (2) V IM = C d ⋅ u(z) ⋅ E IM, (3)

where _C_ _d_ is the plant drag coefficient, specified as 1/6 in this research, and u(z) is the average wind velocity (m s [−][1] )
at height z [29] . _E_ _IN_ and _E_ _IM_ are the collection efficiencies of vegetation surfaces from the interception and impaction
processes, respectively, and can be presented as [33]

St = _τ_ _p_ ⋅ u(z)/ _d_ _n_, (6)

where _d_ _n_ is the dimension of the vegetation element and given for different land cover types and seasons [34] . _τ_ _p_ is
the particle relaxation time, which can be presented as follows:

_τ_ _p_ = _ρ_ _p_ ⋅ _C_ _C_ ⋅ _d_ /18 _p_ 2 ⋅ _μ_ _a_, (7)

where _β_ is an empirical constant (0.8 for the forest and 2.0 for the wetland with plants), _d_ _p_ is the mean particle
diameter (μm), _μ_ _a_ is the dynamic air viscosity, _ρ_ _p_ (μg m [−][3] ) is the density of the particles (and can be replaced by
the particle concentration) [7,29], and _C_ _C_ is the Cunningham correlation factor, which can be calculated as follows:

(1 275. + 0 4. _e_ −. ⋅1 1 _d_ _p_ /2 _λ_ ),

where _λ_ is the mean free path of air (65 nm). The amount of vegetation collection can be calculated as follows:

#### F V = V C ⋅∆ C H, (9) where F V is the vegetation collection and Δ C H is the difference in concentrations between the leeward and wind
ward sides (μg m [−][3] ). In the vertical direction, FP movement within the canopy is affected both by gravity and
vegetation properties; this movement is defined as sedimentation [19] and can be presented as follows:

Dry deposition is the process wherein particles are deposited directly from the

atmosphere onto vegetation, soil, or other surfaces without the hydrometer as a medium [35] . In this work, the eddy

correlation method [7,29,31,35-37] was used to calculate dry deposition onto the forest, and deposition fluxes were
calculated as follows:

F = − _u_ ⁎ × _c_ ⁎, (12)

where F is the level of dry deposition (μg · s [−][1] - _m_ [−][2] ), _u_ - (m s [−][1] ) is the friction velocity, and _c_ - (μg m [−][3] ) is the eddy

#### Dry deposition to the wetland. The two-layer model [38] was used to determine dry deposition onto the wetland.

Here a convenient reference height (usually 10 m) was divided into a constant (upper) layer and a deposition
(lower) layer. The two layers can be distinguished by relative humidity, which decreases with height in the deposition layer but remains nearly unchanged in the constant layer. In this research, the dry deposition layer was
determined as the space spanning the wetland surface to a height of 6 m, in accordance with our pre-investigation.
The deposition velocity can be calculated as the dry deposition velocity in the wetland as follows:

#### Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test differences in FP

accumulation among species; here, calculations for aquatic plants and trees were done separately. The accumulation capabilities of different species in both the surface and wax layers of leaves were also determined. One-way
ANOVA was used to test differences in vegetation collection attributed to heights and species, as well as dry
deposition in different seasons. Differences between individual means were tested using Tukey’s test, and the
t-test was used to compare differences in the accumulation capacities of the two types of plants. The data met the
assumptions of homogeneity of variances. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

## Results
### Leaf accumulation. Figure 3 describes the FP accumulation of each species on the surfaces and wax layers

of leaves. The mean FP amounts of trees are higher than those of aquatic plants, but differences observed are not
significant (P = 0.061). FP accumulation on tree species ranged from 3.85 μg cm [−][2] to 9.78 μg cm [−][2], with an average value of 5.91 μg cm [−][2], while that on aquatic plants ranged from 1.23 to 5.98 μg cm [−][2], with an average value
of 3.03 μg cm [−][2] . Among the aquatic plants, _I. wilsonii_ presents the highest mean accumulation (5.98 ± 3.24 μg
cm [−][2] ), followed by _P. australis_ (4.78 ± 0.93 μg cm [−][2] ); by contrast, _T. orientalis_, _I. setosa_, and _L. salicaria_ show
considerably lower accumulation values (less than 1.90 μg cm [−][2] ). Among tree species, _Q. variabilis_ (9.79 ± 1.82 μg
cm [−][2] ) and _S. matsudana_ (8.90 ± 1.39 μg cm [−][2)] present higher FP accumulations; the accumulations of _M. alba_,
_S. japonica_, and _G. sinensis_ are relatively lower (less than 4.0 μg cm [−][2] ). While differences in accumulation on

=
leaf surfaces between aquatic plants and trees are not significant (P 0.176), those on wax layers are significant (P = 0.003); specifically, accumulation on the waxy layer of trees is higher than that on the waxy layers of
aquatic plants. FP amounts accumulated on the leaf surface are much higher than those observed on the wax layer
(P = 0.003). While differences in accumulation between the leaf surface and waxy layer of aquatic plants are fairly
obvious, those for tree species such as _S. japonica_ are relatively low.

### Structure of the leaf surface. The structure of the leaf surface plays an important role in its ability to cap
ture particles. Thus, different leaf structures may contribute to the heterogeneity of particle accumulation between
different species. SEM photomicrographs of aquatic plants (Fig. 4) and common tree species (Fig. 5) show heterogeneity. Aquatic plants present simple grooves on their leaf surface, while tree leaves present more complicated
structures, such as leaf hairs, protrusions, and raphe. Structural differences between species are also evident on
their adaxial and abaxial surfaces (Figs 4 and 5).

### Vegetation collection and sedimentation. In the horizontal direction, FP movement was affected by

meteorological conditions and the canopy properties. As FP moves from the windward direction to the leeward
direction, it is collected by the canopy through impaction and interception. Figure 6 shows the amount of FP
collected by _Populus_ × _canadensis_ and _S. chinensis_ at different heights in the summer and winter. FP amounts col
=
lected at different heights show small differences (P 0.801). Micro-climate conditions at different heights vary
minimally, and canopy properties are heterogeneous for some species. Thus, no significant difference among the
three heights investigated for the same species is observed.
In winter, the vegetation collection of _S. chinensis_ (0.0057 ± 0.0040 μg m [−][2] s [−][1] ) is higher than that of
_Populus_ × _canadensis_ (0.00073 ± 0.00093 μg m [−][2] s [−][1] ), and the difference observed is significant (P = 0.015); in

=
summer, however, this difference is not significant (P 0.408). Seasons promote no significant difference in the
vegetation collection of _S. chinensis_ (P = 0.913), but the collection amount of _Populus_ × _canadensis_ in summer

=
is significantly higher than that in winter (P 0.025). The maximum FP amounts collected by these two species
occur in summer ( _Populus_ × _canadensis_, 0.0082 μg m [−][2] s [−][1] ; _S. chinensis_, 0.0144 μg m [−][2] s [−][1] ). _Populus_ × _canaden-_
_sis_ is a deciduous species and its canopy is much denser in summer than in winter. The canopy of _S. chinensis_
(an evergreen species) is also denser than that of _Populus_ × _canadensis_ in winter, and this difference may influence
the variation in vegetation collection of these two species between seasons. In summer, differences among the two
canopies do not appear to lead to significant differences in collection amount.

In the vertical direction, FP movements within the canopy are affected by both gravity and concentration
gradient. FP is trapped within the canopy during hazy days or high FP concentration times. As the particle concentration beyond the canopy decreases, FP moves outward from the canopy. We used a model in the current
study to obtain vector results and considered movement to be emission if its direction is from the canopy to the
atmosphere; otherwise, movement was considered to be sedimentation. Figure 7 shows the sedimentation/emission of two species at different heights; here, calculated values are negative in winter but positive in summer. This
result indicates that the forest is a source of FP in winter but a sink in summer. The absolute value of sedimentation/emission ((3.51 ± 3.98) × 10 [−][13] μg m [−][2] s [−][1] ) is extremely small and much lower than the collection amount
((4.25 ± 4.50) × 10 [−][3] μg m [−][2] s [−][1] ).

### Dry deposition. Table 1 summarizes FP dry deposition velocities in different seasons in the wetland and forest.

P-values were calculated to indicate differences among various conditions (i.e., seasons, times, and land surfaces).
In detail, the FP deposition velocity in the wetland is lower than that in the forest in summer, but the difference

higher than that in the wetland (P 0.018). Furthermore, no significant variation in deposition velocity between

day and night is observed for both the wetland (P = 0.086) and forest (P = 0.610). Deposition velocities in winter
(0.76 ± 0.31 cm s [−][1] ) are significantly higher than those in summer (0.42 ± 0.24 cm s [−][1], P = 0.001).
Figure 8 shows the dry deposition fluxes of FP in the wetland and forest at different times. The respective
deposition fluxes in the wetland and forest are 0.12 ± 0.15 μg m [−][2] s [−][1] and 0.49 ± 0.15 μg m [−][2] s [−][1] in summer and
0.32 ± 0.29 μg m [−][2] s [−][1] and 1.78 ± 0.40 μg m [−][2] s [−][1] in winter. In winter, deposition onto the forest is significantly

=
higher than that onto the wetland (P 0.012); dry deposition onto the forest is also significantly higher in this
season than in summer (P = 0.004). Differences in deposition between seasons are not significant for the wetland (P = 0.104). In addition, variations between daytime and nighttime are not significant for either wetland
(P = 0.684) or forest (P = 0.986).

## Discussion
### Leaf scale. Among the plants sampled, the tree species S. matsudana (8.90 ± 1.39 μg cm [−][2] ) and Q. variabilis

(9.79 ± 1.82 μg cm [−][2] ) showed the highest accumulation of FP on leaf surfaces, while the aquatic species _T. orien-_
_talis_ (1.23 ± 0.48 μg cm [−][2] ) and _L. salicaria_ (1.43 ± 0.85 μg cm [−][2] ) showed the lowest accumulation of FM. In the
current study, the mean FP accumulation of trees was significantly higher than that of aquatic species; however,
the accumulation abilities of different species significantly differed (0.01 < P < 0.05), and the maximum accumulation was about 7.5 times that of the minimum. A previous study [6] discussed the FP accumulation of 35 plant

species (11 shrubs, 24 trees) in Beijing and showed no obvious difference between shrubs and trees in relation to
accumulated particles; in this work, the average FP accumulation amount of trees was 4.51 μg cm [−][2] while that
of shrubs was 3.25 μg cm [−][2] . A study in Norway and Poland also compared the particle accumulation abilities of
trees and shrubs and showed that the highest accumulation was 20 times more than the lowest [12] . While the uncertainty here must be highlighted, we assumed that 15 mm of precipitation could remove all of the particles pre-accumulated on the leaf surface in accordance with previous studies [11,32] and our pre-experiments. This hypothesis
requires further research under different weather and pollution backgrounds.
The complicated structures of tree leaves are considered to enable easier particle capture [39] ; thus, tree species
showed higher mean accumulation amounts than aquatic species. A leaf with larger numbers of stoma and leaf
hairs can capture more particles than one with less of these structures [9,12] . _Populus_ × _canadensis_ presents a larger
number of stoma on both of its leaf surfaces and is therefore able to capture more particles than _G. sinensis_, which
presents virtually no stoma on its adaxial surface. _Q. variabilis_ features high hair density on its abaxial surface and,
therefore, higher FP accumulation than other species.
Certain studies have determined that the ability of the leaf surfaces of species such as _Kolkwitzia amabilis_,
_Pyrus betulifolia_, and _Q. variabilis_ to capture FP is related to their tomentose pubescence [6] . The hairy abaxial leaf

surface of _Platanus occidentalis_ has also been reported to be more efficient in accumulating particulate matter
than a smooth adaxial leaf surface [40] . Different groove widths perform differently in capturing particles, and a
previous study reported that the amount of particles collected increases with increasing groove width [9] . In contrast
to these reports, however, in the present study, we found the opposite result: _T. orientalis_ and _I. setosa_ have wider
grooves than _P. australis_ and _I. wilsonii_ but the former accumulates a smaller amount of FP than the latter. Surface
roughness appeared to exert no significant effect on particle capture; _M. alba_ and _S. matsudana_, for example,
feature rough surfaces covered by a large number of protrusions on both sides, but these structures showed no

.
significant correlation with the amount of FP accumulated by the leaves [12]
This study only provides a qualitative analysis between leaf surface structures and particle accumulation;
therefore, future studies may include quantification of the structures observed and determine the relationship
between accumulation amounts and leaf structures. Similar to current and relevant studies, the aquatic species
_P. australis_ and _I. wilsonii_ and the forest species _S. matsudana_ and _Q. variabilis_ performed very well in terms of
accumulating particles. Considering these findings, we recommend that these species be the first selected for
urban landscaping in areas of severe pollution.

### Canopy scale. Although the FP amount collected by vegetation is affected by the season, current research has

determined these differences to be statistically insignificant. A study in an area of heavy traffic in Nanjing, China,
showed the rank order of dust retained by trees in different seasons to be winter > autumn > summer > spring [41] .
Another study in Qingdao, China, also reported that the dust-detaining capacity of ground cover plants presents a seasonal change in the order of winter > spring > autumn > summer [42] . In our study, the FP amount
collected by _Populus_ × _canadensis_ in winter ((7.33 ± 7.60) × 10 [−][4] μg m [−][2] s [−][1] ) was higher than that obtained in
summer ((6.10 ± 2.10) × 10 [−][4] μg m [−][2] s [−][1] ) but the difference in amounts was insignificant (P > 0.01). _S. chin-_
_ensis_ followed a similar pattern, showing collection amounts of (5.70 ± 3.23) × 10 [−][3] μg m [−][2] s [−][1] in winter and
(5.10 ± 6.58) × 10 [−][3] μg m [−][2] s [−][1] in summer (P > 0.01).
Sedimentation in both _Populus_ × _canadensis_ and _S. chinensis_ tree belts was negative in winter and positive in
summer. The absolute values of emission in the evergreen conifer forest during winter were smaller than those in
the deciduous broadleaf forest. Sedimentation is affected by gravity and accessible surfaces in the vertical direction [19], which means it is also affected by leaf or foliage amounts. Few studies have focused on the quantitative
relationship between vegetation collection and leaf/foliage amounts. In our study, the sedimentation amount was
10 orders of magnitude less than the vegetation amount collected; thus, sedimentation within the canopy can be
ignored.

### Landscape scale. Wet and dry depositions on the landscape scale are considered to be two major pollut
ant removal processes [37] . Because of the relatively dry climate conditions (average annual precipitation, about
500 mm) in Beijing [43], only dry deposition was estimated in this research. Forests and wetlands present unique
biophysical properties that make their micro-climates and inter-surface conditions distinct, thereby leading to
contrasting dry deposition results.
The dry deposition velocities in the forest and wetland calculated in the current study were compared with the
results of previous studies in Beijing (Table 2). Although the values obtained were close, in this study, the dry deposition velocities in the forest revealed a large mean value and relatively small standard deviation, which means
these velocities are fairly stable. Deposition velocities are known to depend strongly on atmospheric conditions.
In contrast to previous studies that calculated deposition velocity over a relatively small time scale, in this study, a
12-hour average Monine-Obukhov length and friction velocity were used to achieve stable results; unfortunately,
this technique also leads to an increase in uncertainty.
The results indicate that dry deposition velocities varied more dramatically between different periods within
a single day while daily averages seemed to be more predictable. All of our results show that deposition velocities
in the wetland are lower than those in the forest, which could be related to a number of micro-atmospheric conditions as well as the model structure applied. We acknowledge that our prediction model may not be 100% correct;
thus, measurements must also be conducted. The results show that the deposition velocity at night is lower than
that during the day, which is likely caused by relatively higher FP concentrations and friction velocities in the

former than in the latter [29,31] . Deposition fluxes showed the opposite pattern, also likely because of the presence of
higher FP concentrations in the day.

### Comparison of removal ability. On the leaf scale, the average FP accumulation of tree species was higher

than that of aquatic species. The total leaf area of a forest is generally higher than that of a wetland of the same size;
thus, forest plants are able to capture more FP than wetland plants. On the individual scale, coniferous species
( _S. chinensis_ ) collected more FP than broadleaf species ( _Populus_ × _canadensis_ ), but the difference observed was
statistically insignificant. On the landscape scale, significantly more FP was deposited onto the forest than onto the
wetland, both in summer and winter, similar to the results reported by a previous study within the same area [7,29] .
Forests are thus considered to remove more FP by dry deposition than other methods on the landscape scale.
Considering the results, forests in the urban area of Beijing present better FP removal ability than wetlands;
thus, urban forests should be the first option in urban planning aiming to mitigate FP pollution. _S. matsudana_
and _Q. variabilis_ revealed better leaf accumulation ability than other trees, and coniferous species presented better
removal ability (via vegetation collection and dry deposition) than aquatic species [31] . Despite these findings, wetlands remain indispensable landscapes in urban areas and provide a large number of other eco-service functions
besides PM removal, such as flood storage, micro-climate regulation, and habitat provision [44] . In accordance with
the results of this research, we suggest that _P. australis_ and _I. wilsonii_ be the preferred species used in wetland
construction and that tree species be planted at perimeter areas, if possible. We note here that this work only
focuses on FP collection. Deposition of other particles, such as PM10, on the surface of water in winter is known
to be higher than that onto forests [7,29] . Consequently, further studies are required before a complete guide to urban
planning for particle removal can be finalized.

### Uncertainty analysis. Dry deposition and vegetation collection velocities are highly influenced by particle

size [4,19,33,45] . In the current study, we focused on particle sizes ranging from 0.2-2.5 μm; at this range, the deposition velocity varied minimally with particle size and the average diameter was used to calculate deposition and
vegetation collection. Particle dry deposition is a dynamic process controlled by aerodynamic and meteorological
conditions [9,46], which may also be affected by air turbulence and other surface properties [13] . As such, using a simplified empirical parameter in the deposition and vegetation collection models could present another source of
uncertainty. Despite this limitation, the calculation method used in this work has been proven to be valid because
all of the errors and results obtained are in the same order of magnitude as those presented in related studies in
the same area [7,29-31] . Thus, these models can adequately represent overall deposition.

## Conclusions

The FP removal ability of forests is better than that of wetland areas in the urban region of Beijing. On the leaf scale,
common afforestation species are able to accumulate more FP on the leaf surfaces than aquatic species in wetlands.
Among the species sampled in the urban forest and wetland ecosystem, _Q. variabilis_ and _I. wilsonii_ are the most
effective in accumulating FP in their leaves. Horizontal vegetation collection is the major FP removal process on
the individual scale; the contribution of vertical sedimentation/emission on this scale may be ignored. Coniferous
tree species present stronger FP collection ability than broadleaf species, although differences between species are
statistically insignificant. On the landscape scale, greater deposition onto the forest than onto the wetland may be
observed. Furthermore, dry deposition is the major process of FP removal on rain-free days. In conclusion, when
planning an urban green system, planting an urban forest should be the first option for FP mitigation.
