# General Description

The Model B-1 Upright and Pendent
Foam-Water Sprinklers are air-aspirating foam discharge outlets designed for use in foam-water deluge
systems. They are designed for flammable liquid risks where it is desired to
apply foam from overhead sprinklers
(either upright or pendent) and where
follow-up with plain water in a standard
spray sprinkler pattern is necessary as
in the case of NFPA 16, “Standard for
the Installation of Foam-Water Sprinkler and Foam-Water Spray Systems”.

It is recommended that the end user be
consulted with respect to the suitability
of the materials of construction for any
given corrosive environment. The effects of ambient temperature, concentration of chemicals, and gas/chemical
velocity, should be considered, at a
minimum, along with the corrosive nature to which the sprinklers may be
exposed.

The Model B-1 Foam-Water Sprinkler
is a redesignation for the Gem Issue
B-1 and Star Model B-1.

**WARNINGS**
The Model B-1 Foam-Water Sprinklers
described herein must be installed and
maintained in compliance with this
document, as well as with the applicable standards of the National Fire Pro

**IMPORTANT**
Always refer to Technical Data
Sheet TFP700 for the “INSTALLER
WARNING” that provides cautions
with respect to handling and installation of sprinkler systems and components. Improper handling and installation can permanently damage
a sprinkler system or its components and cause the sprinkler to fail
to operate in a fire situation or cause
it to operate prematurely.

tection Association, in addition to the
standards of any other authorities having jurisdiction. **Failure to do so may**
**impair the performance of these de-**

The owner is responsible for maintaining their fire protection system and devices in proper operating condition.
The installing contractor or sprinkler
manufacturer should be contacted
with any questions.

# Technical Data

**Approvals**

# Operation

The Model B-1 Foam-Water Sprinklers
are designed with a unique venturi
style body. As foam solution (water
and foam concentrate mixture) flows
through the inlet of the body, air is
drawn into the body through the openings adjacent to the wrenching area.
The foam solution and air mix is then
agitated to create an air-aspirated
foam.

The B-1 Foam-Water Sprinklers are
designed to discharge foam in a predetermined discharge pattern, as well
as to discharge water similar to standard spray sprinklers. To meet the intent of NFPA 16, foam-water sprinklers must be able to sufficiently
distribute water after depletion of the
foam concentrate.

# Installation

The Model B-1 Foam-Water Sprinklers
must be installed in accordance with
the following instructions:

**NOTE**
A leak tight 1/2 inch NPT sprinkler joint
should be obtained with a torque of 7
to 14 ft.lbs. (9,5 to 19,0 Nm). A maximum of 21 ft. lbs. (28,5 Nm) of torque
may be used to install sprinklers with
1/2 NPT connections. Higher levels of
torque may distort the sprinkler inlet
and cause impairment of the sprinkler.

**Step 1.** Pendent sprinklers are to be
installed in the pendent position, and
upright sprinklers are to be installed in
the upright position.

**Step 2.** With pipe thread sealant applied to the pipe threads, hand tighten
the sprinkler into the sprinkler fitting.

**Step 3.** Tighten the sprinkler into the
sprinkler fitting using an 8 or 10 inch
adjustable Crescent wrench. With reference to Figures 1 and 3, the adjustable Crescent wrench is only to be
applied to the wrench flats of the
wrenching area.

# Design Criteria

The Model B-1 Upright and Pendent
Foam-Water Sprinklers are intended
for fire protection systems designed in
accordance with the standard installation rules for foam-water sprinklers
systems recognized by the applicable
Listing agency (e.g., UL Listing is
based on the requirements of NFPA 13
and 16).

Figure 2 provides the nominal discharge patterns for reference use.

**NOTE**
The discharge patterns shown in Figure 2 are not to be used for design
purposes or to disregard standard installation rules.

Not less than two foam-water sprinklers are to be installed in any area,
regardless of size, in order to obtain
pattern overlap.

The applied density (flow per unit of
area) of foam solution must meet the
requirements of the Authority Having
Jurisdiction for the type flammable liquid and occupancy. Per NFPA 16, coverage density must not be less than
0.16 GPM/ft [2] (6,52 mm/min) of floor

area with a resulting minimum discharge pressure of not less than 30 psi
(2,1 bar).

Foam-water sprinkler spacing must
not exceed the requirements of NFPA
13 for extra hazard occupancies and
the system must be hydraulically calculated to obtain the required density
and discharge pressure.

**NOTE**
Discharge outlets and foam concentrates are Listed for use together. Refer to the individual foam concentrate
Listing for operating limitations and
compatibility with the B-1 Foam-Water
Sprinklers as provided in the UL Fire
Protection Equipment Directory.

**TFP840** **Page 3 of 4**

# Care and Maintenance

The Model B-1 Foam-Water Sprinklers
must be maintained and serviced in
accordance with the following instructions:

**NOTE**
Before closing a fire protection system
main control valve for maintenance
work on the fire protection system that
it controls, permission to shut down the
affected fire protection system must be
obtained from the proper authorities
and all personnel who may be affected
by this action must be notified.

Model B-1 Foam-Water Sprinklers
must never be painted, plated, coated
or altered in any way after leaving the
factory; otherwise, the spray performance may be impaired.

Care must be exercised to avoid damage to the sprinklers - before, during,
and after installation. Sprinklers damaged by dropping, striking, wrench
twist/slippage, or the like, must be replaced.

Frequent visual inspections are recommended to be initially performed for
sprinklers installed in potentially corrosive atmospheres to verify the integrity
of the materials of construction as they
may be affected by the corrosive conditions present for a given installation.
Thereafter, annual inspections per
NFPA 25 are required.

The owner is responsible for the inspection, testing, and maintenance of
their fire protection system and devices in compliance with this document, as well as with the applicable
standards of the National Fire Protection Association (e.g., NFPA 25), in
addition to the standards of any other
authorities having jurisdiction. The installing contractor or sprinkler manufacturer should be contacted relative
to any questions.

It is recommended that foam-water
sprinkler systems be inspected,
tested, and maintained by a qualified
Inspection Service in accordance with
local requirements and/or national
codes.
