he pH is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the
chemical activity (concentration in mol·L [-1] ) of the
# T hydrogen ion in solution. The pH scale indicates a

neutral solution at pH 7.0, an acidic solution below 7.0,
and an alkaline (basic) solution above 7.0. A unit change
in pH corresponds to a tenfold change in the hydrogen ion
concentration; thus, small changes in pH can significantly
alter the chemistry of marine and estuarine waters.

The pH of marine waters is usually quite stable (between
7.5 and 8.5 worldwide) and is similar to that of estuarine
waters because of the buffering capacity provided by the
abundance of strong basic cations such as sodium,
potassium, and calcium and of weak acid anions such as
carbonates and borates (Wetzel 1983). Higher pHs are
usually found in near-surface waters because of solar
radiation. The effect of solar radiation on pH is twofold: it
promotes photosynthesis and increases surface temperatures, both of which decrease the amount of free carbonic
acid and consequently raise the pH (Skirrow 1965; Wetzel
1983). For example, at a depth of 23 m in the Beaufort
Sea, an average pH of 7.79 was recorded, whereas surface
pH measurements averaged 8.1 (Thomas et al. 1982).
Such effects can be the result of both diurnal and seasonal

fluctuations (Skirrow 1965). The longer periods of
daylight experienced in June, for instance, have caused
surface pH in the Beaufort Sea to average 8.1, whereas in
February, the average surface pH dropped to 7.84
(Thomas et al. 1982).

Even in estuaries and embayments, where considerable
dilution of seawater from freshwater sources occurs,
buffering is sufficient to maintain stable pH values,
usually in the slightly alkaline range. Reported ranges of
pH for brackish areas of the Fraser River estuary (Swain
and Holms 1985, 1988), the Burrard Inlet (Nijman and
Swain 1990), and the Mackenzie River delta (Thomas et
al. 1982) were 7.3 % 8.3, 7.4 % 8.8, and 7.85 % 8.6,
respectively.

Fluctuations in pH due to anthropogenic influences in
aquatic environments are largely the effects of industrial
activities. Acid precipitation caused by SO 2 and NO X
emissions from industries and vehicles can depress the pH
of surface waters, especially after spring snowmelt, when
significant amounts of accumulated acid deposition (i.e.,
in the snow pack) are flushed into marine and estuarine

waters (Knutzen 1981; Kaufmann et al. 1992). Deposition
of atmospheric CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion
can also lead to decreases in the alkalinity and pH of
marine waters (Jones and Levy 1981). In addition, the pH
of aquatic environments can be altered as the result of
direct inputs of acid, through acid mine drainage, and
some industrial waste leachates (McNeely et al. 1979).

**Biological Effects**

A broad spectrum of marine and estuarine organisms have
been shown to be adversely affected by pH fluctuations,
many of these effects being physiological. A decrease in
pH was correlated with a reduction in carapace weight,
increased magnesium content (with constant calcium
content), and a slight decrease in strontium content of the
marine prawn _Penaeus monodon_ (Wickins 1984). In the
marine octopus _Octopus dofleini_, a pH below 7.2 was
correlated with a decrease in maximum oxygen saturation
of hemocyanin, a blood oxygen transporter (Miller and
Magnum 1988). At pH below 7, reduced growth, weight
loss, reduced shell size, shell dissolution, and suppressed
feeding occurred in four species of bivalves (Bamber
1987, 1990). Significant mortalities occurred in the same
four species after a 60-d exposure to similar test
conditions.

An increase in acidity can affect physical processes in
organisms. Cell aggregation of sea urchin embryos
_(Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus)_ was found to be affected by
low pH and was obliterated at a pH lower than 4.0
(Tonegawa et al. 1990). Fluctuations in pH can also affect
photosynthetic processes. Inhibition of photosynthesis was
observed in the seagrass _Zostera muelleri_ at pH less than
7.8, while maximum photosynthetic activity occurred at
pH 8.4 (Millhouse and Strother 1986). A combined
increase in pH and oxygen concentration and a decrease in
dissolved inorganic carbon concentration inhibited
photosynthetic activity in five species of marine
macroalgae (Gordon and Sand-Jensen 1990).

In the marine environment, pH changes can also
significantly affect the chemical forms and toxicity of
other substances. In water, ammonia exists in two forms: a
non-ionic species, NH 3, and an ionic species, NH 4+ . The
toxicity of ammonia to marine species is largely

determined by the concentration of the non-ionic species.
The relative concentration of NH 3 in seawater is
influenced in part by pH; with a reduction of one pH unit,
the amount of NH 3 in water diminishes by a factor of 10
(Miller et al. 1990). Responses of marine organisms to
alterations in ambient NH 3 concentrations as a result of
pH fluctuations will vary between species. Juvenile
mysids _(Mysidopsis bahia)_ experienced decreasing acute
toxicity to ammonia as pH increased from 7.0 to 9.0. In
contrast, acute toxicity of ammonia to the inland silverside
_(Menidia beryllina)_ was greatest at pH 7.0 and 9.0 and
lowest at pH 8.0 (Miller et al. 1990). The speciation of
metals and the solubility of some organic chemicals are
also strongly influenced by pH (Bengtsson 1978; Kaiser
and Valdmanis 1982; Drever 1988).

**Interim Guideline**

The pH of marine and estuarine waters should fall within
the range of 7.0 % 8.7 units unless it can be demonstrated
that such a pH is a result of natural processes. Within this
range, pH should not vary by more than 0.2 pH units from
the natural pH expected at that time. Where pH is
naturally outside this range, human activities should not
cause pH to change by more than 0.2 pH units from the
natural pH expected at that time, and any change should
tend towards the recommended range (CCME 1996).

**Rationale**

The interim guideline for an acceptable pH range in
Canada is based largely on the guideline of British
Columbia (McKean and Nagpal 1991). This guideline is
representative of the pH range commonly observed in
Canadian coastal waters. To provide additional guidance
when pH naturally exceeds the recommended guideline
range, the proviso of the Alaskan guideline (State of
Alaska 1989), which permits induced changes in pH only
towards the specified range, has been adopted.

Unrestricted variation in pH due to human influences
within the specified range may not be protective of
organisms with narrow pH tolerances. The limit on
induced pH changes (0.2 pH units) within this range is
recommended to reduce the potential for impacts on
organisms. Similar recommendations have been adopted
in several jurisdictions, including Australia, California,
the United States, Washington, and Western Australia.
