**A** **BSTRACT.** _Ammonia, methane, and carbon dioxide are the primary atmospheric emissions from cattle and pig farms. A_
_significant part of these emissions is produced by the decomposition of slurry organic matter during manure storage and_
_treatment phases. Present solutions to contain emissions from storage lagoons generally involve reducing the free surface of_
_the slurry by covering it either with permanent fixed structures or temporary floating ones. This study investigated the_
_effectiveness of five simple floating covers in reducing emissions from pig and cattle slurry. The coverings included vegetable_
_oil (a mixture of rapeseed and soybean oil), expanded clay, chopped maize stalks, chopped wheat straw, and chopped wood_
_chips. All were tested at two different thicknesses: 70 and 140 mm for solid coverings, and 3 and 9 mm for liquid. Slurry_
_samples covered with the above-mentioned materials were placed in nine stainless steel airtight cylinders measuring 190 dm_ _[3]_ _._
_Gaseous and odor concentrations in the headspace were monitored using a Bruel & Kjaer 1302 multi-gas monitor and a T07_
_olfactometer. The flotation aptitude of the different coverings was also tested. Results revealed substantial differences in_
_ammonia emission reduction efficiency (1% to 100%) and odor abatement (0% to 90%), and high levels of reduction efficiency_
_were achieved by all the tested covers at the higher thickness. However, equally valid results were not obtained for methane_

stimations of atmospheric emissions from Italian
cattle and pig farms are primarily concerned with
ammonia (97% of the total national ammonia emis# E sions), methane (52%), and nitrous oxide (48%)

production. It has been demonstrated that a significant part
of these emissions is produced during manure storage and
treatment due to the decomposition of slurry organic matter
and prolonged contact with the atmosphere (Valli et al.,
2000).
A key role is played by nitrogen, in all its different
biochemical forms, which together with carbohydrates is an
essential element in the life cycle of organisms and
fundamental for ensuring good livestock productions. Nevertheless, animals are unable to metabolize all the nitrogen
supplied in their diet (e.g., through tissue preservation,
growth, and/or milk production). According to literature,
dairy cows tend to excrete an average 79% of the supplied

nitrogen, while pigs excrete 65% (Tamminga, 1992; CRPA,
2001).
The forms and amounts of nitrogen excreted in slurry vary
according to diet and animal species. An average of 60% to
90% of nitrogen excreted in urine is represented by urea in
dairy cows (Bristow et al., 1992), while the percentage is
about 70% to 90% for pigs (Bristow et al., 1992; Petersen,
1998). Most of the nitrogen excreted in feces is in organic
form (namely partially or totally undigested proteins).
Nitrogenous components, present in both urine and the feces,
have a strong influence on ammonia emission into the
atmosphere, although this importance varies with the emitting stage under consideration.
Nitrogen excretion as urea is extremely important in
livestock housing because of enzymatic hydrolysis. Organic
nitrogen, mainly present in the feces, is highly unstable and
reacts with the urease enzyme (Kastelaar and Rap, 1994), but
it can only be considered an important source of emission in
the event of mineralization caused by long-term storage. In
fact, with reference to urease reaction, it should be stressed
that under farm conditions, with relatively high temperatures
and extensive paved surfaces, urea excreted by animals is
transformed into ammoniac nitrogen (eq. 1) in just a few
hours (Elzing and Monteny, 1997a):

NH 3 + H 2 O  pH,  T → NH 4 + + OH − (1)

Even though this balance largely depends on slurry
temperature and the ammonia acid dissociation constant
(K a ), with a value that ranges from 0.8 × 10 [−10] (Hashimoto
and Ludington, 1971) for concentrated slurries to 3.982 ×
10 [−10] (Weast et al., 1986) for the more diluted ones, it has
been shown that pH plays the most important role (Elzing and

Chopped wheat straw Individual straws measuring from 7 to 100 mm long.
Chopped maize stalks Individual stalks measuring 100 mm long, with a structure very similar to that of chopped wheat straw.
Wood chips Produced by mechanical chopping of wood: chips measure 20 to 30 mm long and may be dried to prevent deterioration.
Expanded clay Very light and resistant granules with a diameter of 8 to 12 mm.

Monteny, 1997b; Groot Koerkamp and Elzig, 1996; Monteny
et al., 2000):
 6 < pH < 7: almost all the ammoniac nitrogen tends to
be in solubilized form (NH 4 [+] ).
 pH > 7: the balance is shifted toward the non-ionized
and volatile form (NH 3 ).
 pH > 11: all the nitrogen is present as NH 3 .
According to Haslam et al. (1924), airspeed is another
factor that can physically affect ammonia emission from
slurry storage. A drop in wind speed results in higher levels
of NH 3 in the gaseous layer above the free surface of the
slurry, leading to a significant reduction in ammonia
emission. The animal stocking density must also be taken
into account. In particular, greater volumes of slurry per live
weight unit lead to higher emissions from manure storage due
to the very long extended storage time laid down in
regulations.
At present, the main solutions adopted to reduce emissions
from slurry storages involve reducing the free surface of the
slurry by either constructing rooftops or covering the surface
with different materials. Extensive bibliographical documentation from the early 1990s onward attests to a growing interest
in the latter, with the development of both rigid and floating
covers (Mannebeck, 1985) made from different materials and
designed to resist the action of atmospheric agents. Rigid covers
are either attached to the tank structure and supported by various
types of frames, or are self-supporting and created to form a
fixed cover (with roof, sealed, with floor) that is not in contact
with the slurry. As an alternative, floating covers are allowed to
float freely on the entire slurry surface.

Rigid covers require longer assembly times and are more
expensive to set up (MAFF, 1999) but are guaranteed to last
longer. The alternative floating covers can be cheaply
constructed from both organic and inorganic materials such
as straw, expanded clay granules, vegetable oil, wood chips,
rice husks, and corn stalks (Clanton et al., 2001). Therefore,
apart from natural crusts (basically formed by undigested
emerging fiber), floating covers can be created by mixing
slurry with vegetal material. However, there are some
practical limitations to their use:
 The risk of chemical and biological degradation
through contact with the slurry.
 Drift effect caused by wind action.
 The risk of mixing with the slurry.
 The possible risk of sinking and consequently blocking
the drainage systems.
Despite the above disadvantages, several studies have
shown that floating covers can provide a valid emission
abatement system. For example, a reduction efficiency of
70% to 90% has been recorded for ammonia emissions (De
Bode 1991; Bundy et al., 1997; Miner and Suh, 1997;
Hashimoto and Ludington, 1971).

### M ATERIALS AND M ETHODS

The study was aimed at evaluating the efficiency of five
simplified floating covers (table 1) in reducing ammonia,
methane, carbon dioxide, and odor emissions from slurry
storage facilities, as well as their respective flotation aptitude
and capacity.

**T** **ESTING** **OF** **E** **MISSION** **R** **EDUCTION**
Two thicknesses of each floating cover were tested: 70 and
140 mm for solid covers, and 3 and 9 mm for liquid covers
(vegetable oil). The effective reduction of gas emission on
two kinds of manure was tested for each covering material:
one from a full-cycle swine farm, and the other from a dairy
cattle farm. The main chemical and physical features of the
two slurries are reported in table 2.
The TS concentration in pig slurry is quite low (table 2)
due to the common practice of flushing out farrowing barns.
The VS/TS percentage, on average 63.7% ± 3.5%, is
characteristic of slurries subjected to aerobic/anaerobic
transformations during storage, while fresh slurries have an
average VS/TS percentage of 75% to 78% ( _ASAE Standards_,
2005). The same information can be deduced from ammoniac nitrogen expressed as a percentage of total nitrogen: an
average of 50% to 55% in fresh slurries, which tends to
increase as a result of urease action.
The cattle slurry was taken from a free-stall cubicle dairy
cow house equipped with one scraper. The VS/TS percentage
is 67.9% ± 2.0% (77% in fresh slurry according to _ASAE_
_Standards_, 2005), and the ammoniac/total nitrogen ratio is
48.4% ± 3.0% (17% in fresh slurries according to _ASAE_
_Standards_, 2005), caused by an absence of straw and a
minimum farm tank storage of three months.
We encountered considerable practical difficulties in
measuring gases (ammonia, methane, and carbon dioxide)
and odor emissions from the surface of the stored slurry,
basically caused by container dimensions, load variability,
gas diffusion from the internal mass to the surface, and
climatic conditions, which can all effect the emissive flux.
Accurate and repeated measurements were carried out
using nine stainless steel airtight cylinders with a volume of
190 dm [3] (1.5 m high and 0.4 m diameter), used to simulate
the average storage conditions of farm tanks (fig. 1, left).
Nine batch reactors were used for each covering material:
three were set up with the lower covering thickness, three
with the higher thickness, and the remaining three were set
up without any covering, as controls. Each batch reactor was
partially filled with about 150 dm [3] of slurry. A special
rotational homogenization and distribution system was
constructed to ensure that each reactor was filled with the
same type of pig slurry. The mixed slurry was fed to the
reactors via nine flexible pipes (fig. 1, right). Another special
tank was also fitted with a mixing device for similarly

preparing cattle slurry, which has a higher density than pig
slurry. The mixer was kept switched on during filling operations to ensure that the same type of cattle slurry was delivered to each reactor.
All the covering materials, with the exception of vegetable oil, were conditioned before the trial to accurately
reproduce the real conditions of the farm tanks. In fact,
covering materials, in real situations, are subjected to a
variety of phenomena (water/slurry imbibition and drying,
volatile suspended solid and nitrogenous compound enrichment, compacting) that transform the surface layer. Such
transformations affect covering permeability and, consequently, gas diffusion into the atmosphere.
To achieve this partial transformation, all the covering
materials (with the exception of vegetable oil, which is
naturally impermeable and has a lower density than slurry)
were placed in steel baskets (the same size as the batch
reactor) and immersed in a farm tank for about 30 days with
the same slurry used for the trials (fig. 2). The different
coverings were then removed and immediately placed on the
slurry surface inside the batch reactors. Ammonia, methane,
carbon dioxide and odor emissions were measured for every
kind of slurry for each variation of the covering system.

Each material was tested for a period of one week. Three
measurements were taken at three different times during the
trial: the day after filling ( _t_ 0 ), and three ( _t_ 3 ) and seven ( _t_ 7 )
days after filling. After sealing the cylinders, the gaseous
composition of the headspace was monitored online for each
reactor using a Bruel & Kjaer 1302 multi-gas monitor
(Innova Air Tech Instruments A/S, Ballerup, Denmark). This
device measured any increase in gas concentration due to
slurry emission. The sampled air was reintroduced into the
headspace after being measured (fig. 3, left).
Gas emissions were measured according to the “chamber
method” (Mosier, 1989; IAEA, 1992; Smith and Arah, 1992;
Brewer and Costello, 1999; Hornig et al., 1999; Pedersen et
al., 2001), which monitors gas accumulation in an enclosed
headspace over time using a gas analyzer. A variety of
chambers have been designed and labeled as closed, open,
mega, and vented (Berges and Crutzen, 1996; Sibbesen and
Lind, 1993; Smith et al., 1994; Velthof et al., 1997). These
methods have the advantage of being cheap and can detect
even very low fluxes, making them most suitable for
short-term studies.
Because the cylinder is airtight, gas concentration in the
headspace tends to initially increase in a linear manner until
it reaches a constant asymptotic value, where the partial

pressure of the gases in the headspace equals the vapor pressure of their dissolved fraction in slurry. Therefore, the angular coefficient of the regression line, calculated in the initial
linear part of the gas saturation function (fig. 4), represents
slurry emitting potential, as the vapor pressure of the dissolved ammonia is not influenced by its partial pressure in the
initial gaseous phase. Consequently, the concentration gradient can be assumed as the emissive flow in calm atmospheric
conditions. A fan was used to mix the headspace volume to
prevent any errors during sampling. Regression linearity was
verified by means of the Fisher test of interference.

To account for the different headspace volumes and to
compare the various samples, calculations included:
 The concentration gradient over time of the linear tract
of gaseous concentration function _(_  _c_ /  _t_ ).
 The volume of the headspace above the emitting surface ( _V_ _HS_ ).
 The emitting surface ( _A_ ).
The emissive flow ( _E_, kg m [−2] s [−1] ) of the various reactors
was accordingly calculated as:

_E_ = (∆(∆ _c_ _t_ ⋅ _V_ ⋅ _HS_ _A_ ) ) (2)

The various covering and control samples were compared
by applying Student’s t-test to the emissive flow values ( _E_ ).
The typical trend of one monitoring of the headspace
saturation function is shown in figure 4. The duration and
intensity of the concentration gradient depend on the slurry
emissive potential (which is affected by NH 4 [+] concentration,
pH, volatile and suspended solids), the headspace volume,
and the temperature of the two phases (slurry and air). As the
latter variable was the same for all repetitions, it was not
considered in the calculations.

abatement efficiency of each tested cover. Each batch reactor
was equipped with a pump and a charcoal filter to blow purified air onto the slurry surface using a diffusion disk slightly
smaller than the reactor diameter. It was thus possible to simulate wind action on farm tanks. Before sampling, the headspace was fluxed with an airflow of 5 dm [3] min [−1] to
sufficiently change the filtered air. The volume of fluxed air
was at least three times higher than that of the headspace. Further purified air was fluxed into the headspace, and thanks to
the airtight sealing, any odorous air from the headspace could
be collected in nalophan bags (Clanton et al., 2001) and subsequently analyzed using the olfactometer (CEN, 2003),
within 24 h of sampling, to determine the odor concentration
expressed as odor unit per cubic meter (OU m [−3] ).

**T** **ESTING** **OF** **F** **LOTATION** **A** **PTITUDE**
The flotation aptitude of all the solid covering materials
on pig slurry was also tested at two different total solids
concentrations (about 14.9 g kg [−1] and 43.3 g kg [−1] ). Flotation
aptitude and resistance to sinking are fundamental for
guaranteeing the correct choice of covering and storage
lagoon management, as sinking coverings not only affect
emission reduction but also increase lagoon deposits, leading
to complications during the emptying phase, not to mention
higher management costs.
Seven plastic bins (90 cm height and 50 cm diameter)
were filled with 60 dm [3] of pig slurry at two different total
solids (TS) concentration to test the long-term flotation
aptitude of the coverings. Three of the bins were filled with
pig slurry at about 1.5% TS concentration, while the
remaining four contained pig slurry at about 4% TS
concentration (table 3). This trial was aimed at checking the
influence of slurry density on covering flotation aptitude.
These two TS pig slurry concentrations were chosen as
representative of the two main kinds of swine farms:
full-cycle farms, where frequent flushing in the farrowing
compartment leads to high TS dilutions, and fattening barns,
where slurry is usually more concentrated due to its removal
by scrapers and vacuum systems.
Such tests were carried out on all the tested materials, with
the exception of vegetable oil. The covering flotation
aptitude was tested with both the TS concentrations; only the

expanded clay was tested with one TS concentration.
Photographs of the coverings were taken every 2 to 4 weeks
to record the flotation conditions of the materials. These
conditions were then related to daily recorded meteorological data (temperature, rainfall, relative humidity).

### R ESULTS

**E** **VALUATION** **ON** **A** **MMONIA,** **M** **ETHANE,** **AND** **C** **ARBON**
**D** **IOXIDE** **E** **MISSION**
The slurry temperatures, recorded during the gas emission
tests, are reported in table 4. The trials involving pig slurry
were carried out in the spring (11.7°C average temperature),
while those involving cattle slurry were carried out in the
summer (18.5°C average temperature). In some tests, we
recorded average temperatures that were significantly different from the seasonal average temperature (e.g., the temperature of 5.2°C during the vegetable oil test with pig slurry).
Table 4 also shows the temperature range recorded during the
tests. Very high maximum temperatures were recorded in
both the summer and winter, which might have affected the
results.
All the tested covers for pig slurry showed good ammonia
reduction efficiencies (over 75%), with statistically significant values exclusively at greater thickness (9 mm for oil and
140 mm for all the other materials), as shown in table 5. These
are comparable to those reported by Hornig et al. (1999), who
found reduction efficiencies of 79.9% for chopped straw
coverings (5 to 15 cm of depth) and reduction efficiencies of
91% for granules of expanded clay.
Vegetable oil was the most effective material: 100% for
the thicker layer (9 mm), and 79% for the thinner layer
(3 mm). These high efficiencies are comparable to those
found by Portejoie et al. (2003), who reported an ammonia
reduction emission of 93% for 10 mm thick oils. This efficacy
may be due to the fact that total ammoniac nitrogen is not
soluble in oil, which therefore forms an impermeable and
continuous barrier on the slurry surface.
The thinner coverings did not show significant emission
reduction efficiencies, presumably because they are materials that tend to get easily soaked, thus enhancing the exposure
of the ammoniac nitrogen to air. Reference reactors (those set

up without any covering system on the slurry surface) showed
emissions ranging from 1.11 g m [2] h [−1] (recorded during the
coldest times with the slurry temperature at 5.2°C) to 4.46 g
m [2] h [−1] (with a slurry temperature of 16.5°C), with average
emissions of 2.27 g m [2] h [−1] . These values can be compared to
the results of Sommer (1997), who reported NH 3 volatilization from uncovered slurry ranging from 0.23 to 1.41 g m [−2]
h [−1] in a 5°C to 20°C air temperature range. The total nitrogen
concentration and the ammoniac/total nitrogen ratio, as reported by Ni (1999), might also have affected the resulting
emission factors.
The higher temperatures recorded in the test carried out on
expanded clay (12.7°C) caused emissions to be lower than
those measured on wood chips (9.3°C) because of the lower
percentage of ammoniac nitrogen in slurry (57.9% vs.

74.4%). Figure 5a shows the relationship between ammonia
emission and pig slurry temperature.
Figure 5 illustrates the correlation between ammonia
emission and slurry temperature in both pig and cattle tests.
According to Ni (1999) and Monteny et al. (1998), the NH 3
release flux is essentially a function of the convective mass
transfer coefficient, NH 3 concentration in the gaseous phase
at the slurry surface, NH 3 concentration in the free air stream,
and slurry and air temperatures.High levels of ammonia
emission reduction efficiency were achieved by all the
thicker tested coverings for cattle slurry (table 6).
Straw and stalks also proved to be effective in thinner
layers, with emission reduction values comparable to those
of vegetable oil, while expanded clay particles and wood
chips efficiencies were not significantly different from that
of the control. The high performance of wheat straw probably
derives from the emergence of suspended solids (very
common in cattle slurry), which fill in the interspaces of the
wattle. The layer is then compacted by a subsequent
alternation of wetting and drying processes. The reduction
efficiency is higher than that obtained with pig slurry because
of the higher suspended solids content of cattle slurry (61.4 g
kg [−1] vs. 23.3 g kg [−1] ). Average ammonia emission in the
reference reactors was 0.89 g m [−2] h [−1], ranging from 0.26 g
m [−2] h [−1] (with a slurry temperature of 13.3°C) to 1.72 kg m [−2]
h [−1] (carried out in warmer temperatures of 20°C to 21°C).
The relation between ammonia emission and cattle slurry
temperature is shown in figure 5b.
Differences in ammonia emissions from cattle and pig
slurry can be ascribed to variations in the ammoniac/total
nitrogen ratio, which is, on average, 67.8% for pig slurry and
48% for cattle slurry. In comparing the regression functions
given in figure 5, we note that at a temperature of 15°C,
ammonia emission from cattle slurry is 0.61 g m [−2] h [−1], while
that from pig slurry is 2.72 g m [−2] h [−1] . Furthermore, NH 3
emission in both slurries is closely related to CO 2 emission.
A reduction in CO 2 emission causes the surface pH to drop
and this in turn causes a drop in NH 3 emission (Xue et al.,
1999; Monteny et al., 1998).
No statistically significant reductions in methane emission from pig slurry were found for any of the tested materials

(table 5), but significant carbon dioxide emission reductions
were detected in the thicker layers of wood chips (P < 0.01),
expanded clay granules and wheat straw (both with P < 0.05),
while significant emission reductions were obtained in thinner layers of expanded clay granules (P < 0.05). Average
methane emission was 24.55 g m [−2] h [−1], while carbon dioxide
emission was 156.6 g m [−2] h [−1], signifying prevailing aerobic
micro-organism action. The only significant reduction
(31.7%, P < 0.01) was recorded for the 140 mm thickness of
wood chips (table 6). Similar results were recorded for cattle
slurry: 35.6 g m [−2] h [−1] for methane emission, and 231.5 g m [−2]
h [−1] for carbon dioxide emission.

The lower efficiency of the tested covers in containing
methane emissions is probably due to the gas’s very low
solubility. Methane forms bubbles in the bottom layers where
the organic degradation is more intense. These bubbles tend
to aggregate and then suddenly rise, breaking the surface
crust or the covers (even vegetable oil covers). The emission
reduction induced by thicker coverings suggests that they act
as a physical barrier on the manure surface. Good correlation
was also found between methane and carbon dioxide
emission for pig slurry (fig. 6) and cattle slurry (fig. 7).
Emission intensity is strictly dependent on slurry temperature
and volatile solids concentration.

All the materials proved highly effective in reducing odors
from pig slurry when used at the greater thickness (table 7), with
maize stalks reducing odor by up to 90%. All the materials,
except wheat straw, also proved effective in reducing odor at the
lower thickness. The atypical value for wheat straw was
probably caused by anomalies during the test on pig slurry,

which can be shown by the good performance of straw in the
case of cattle slurry (table 7). Odor emission from slurry is
strongly influenced by ammonia and hydrogen sulfide (Xue et
al., 1998). Xue et al. (1999) also reported that covers on slurry
can lead to a decrease in the hydrogen sulfide mass transfer
coefficient, while CO 2 emission reduction results in a decrease
of slurry pH (tables 4 and 5).

**T** **ESTING** **OF** **F** **LOTATION** **A** **PTITUDE**
The relevant features of the pig slurry used in this test are
given in table 3, while table 8 givesthe time elapsed from the
beginning of the trial, the time lap between two consecutive
measurements, and the temperature, relative humidity, and
rainfall values calculated with reference both to the total time
and time elapsed between two consecutive measurements.
The following flotation behavior was observed for the
materials under consideration:
 Expanded clay (fig. 8) distributed on slurry kept the surface dry. It did not show any sinking aptitude or physical
alteration over time. All the same, other authors (MAFF,
2000) noted an increase in the slurry depth inside the bin
with an increase in rainfall. This occurred because expanded clay prevents rainwater from evaporating, thus
leading to accumulation in the bin.

 Wood chips (fig. 9) maintained a good flotation aptitude throughout the trial. Even better results could be
achieved when woods chips are applied to slurry with
a higher total solids concentration.
 Wheat straw and maize stalks (fig. 10), both throughout
the experiment and according to other authors (MAFF,
2000), maintained a good flotation aptitude when
placed on slurry with 4% total solids during the first
three months of the test. They then completely sank as
a result of a significant increase in rainfall. The same
materials also sank and mixed with the solid fraction
when placed on slurry with 2% total solids; this had no
connection with rainfall. Only straw fragments remained around the rim of the bin, probably due to friction and cohesion forces between the straw fragments
and the bin wall.
