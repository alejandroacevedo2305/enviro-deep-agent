Backhoe Loader

**Cat** **[®]** **3054C Engine*** **Weights**
Gross Power ISO 14396 68.5 kW (93 hp) Operating Weight 8425 kg
Net Power Rating at 2,200 rpm 66.0 kW (88 hp) **Backhoe Digging Depth**

*Emissions equivalent to EU Stage II. Dig Depth 4709 mm

**Caterpillar has a well proven history in the construction equipment industry and has**
**been producing the highest quality machines for 90 years, making progress possible**
**and driving positive and sustainable change on every continent. For over 35 years,**
**from the A Series to the new F2 Series we have produced Backhoe Loaders that are**
**designed with the operator in mind, providing reliability, power and a quality operator**
**environment. The Cat 426F2 Backhoe Loader continues this tradition, providing a**
**machine to help you grow your business.**

### Operator Station

Everyone can get comfortable in this cab.

**All Day Comfort**

The all new 426F2 cab is designed to provide maximum comfort, ease of

operation and overall style for today’s demanding operator. The new design
features a spacious interior, flat glass and excellent visibility. The cab is
wider allowing the operator to freely move when turning from one mode

of operation to another.

Excellent ergonomics ensure that all controls are within easy reach of

the operator. Other features include additional storage space, large vents

throughout the cab and clear gauges that provide information to the

operator to help maximize the machine’s performance. Tinted glass is

offered as standard.

### Power Train

Powerful performance.

### Power Train

The 426F2 features the Cat 3054C engine. The engine is a

four cylinder, four stroke direct injection turbo, equipped

with standard glow plug starting for optimal cold weather

performance. This provides reliable starting performance

down to -26°C. The engine also features a gear driven

water pump, providing better reliability than conventional

belt driven technology.

**Axle and Brakes**

The 426F2 rear axle is an enclosed design with a wet

multi-plate braking system. The system is oil immersed

and self-adjusting, and allows operation in the harshest

environments. The system has dual brake pedals for split

braking in tight corners.

The All Wheeled Drive (AWD) is engaged via a front

console panel switch or by the brake pedal during

all-wheel-braking operation. The AWD can be engaged

on the move, under load, in any gear and in forward

or reverse.

The AWD front axle is pendulum mounted and

permanently sealed and lubricated, requiring no

daily maintenance.

**Transmission**

The 426F2 comes equipped with a 40 km/h Power-Shuttle

transmission, improving roading speed and providing

better spacing between gear ratios. The forward/reverse

lever on the steering column is placed for easy directional

changes on the move, and the gear selection is from a
floor mounted shift lever.

**5**

### Loader Performance

Parallel lift and superior breakout forces.

**Parallel Lift**

The 426F2 parallel lift loader boasts class leading lift

capacities and breakout forces, providing more power

and greater productivity.

Available with either a General Purpose or Multi-Purpose

bucket, the 426F2 can be matched precisely to your

needs. The proven design of the F2 loader makes light

work of lifting and loading.

The parallel lift loader arms offer excellent forward

visibility along with outstanding material retention

throughout the lift and lower cycles.

**6**

### Backhoe Performance

Versatile design for any application.

**Excavator Style Boom**

Caterpillar’s instantly recognizable boom is more than

a cosmetic design feature, it also outperforms straight

boom designs too. Whether close-up truck loading on a

narrow highway or digging over obstacles such as walls,

the excavator style boom outperforms the rest.

Combine this versatility with powerful breakout forces
and the controllability of the load-sensing, flow sharing
hydraulic system and you have the best boom and stick

combination in the industry. Additionally our system offers

swing and boom cushioning as standard. This feature

enables very fast trenching by damping the boom on lift

or swing while trenching.

**7**

### Power and Efficiency

Load-sensing system delivers improved fuel economy.

**Hydraulic Performance**

It’s rare that you’ll be working at full production 100% of the time, so why should

the machine be working at full capacity, using more fuel, making more noise

and generally increasing wear and tear on key components? The 426F2 has

a load-sensing, closed center hydraulic system, which is designed to closely
match power and flow to the demand needed by the operation.

So whether you’re in full trenching mode, or delicately digging around services,

you are always in total control. In applications such as loading and carrying
speed is important. The system will match the flow needed to get the job done
quickly and efficiently. As there is minimal demand on the system unless needed,
there are less parasitic horsepower losses and more power available for rimpull

which means better loading and roading performance.

The 426F2 also features flow-sharing hydraulic valves, ensuring that the correct
flow of oil reaches the implement cylinders, providing greater control and
eliminating oil starvation when operating multiple functions, such as grading

with the backhoe.

**8**

### Serviceability

Easy service to keep your machine working.

**Easy Access**
The 426F2 is equipped with a flip open hood, allowing access to all the
check and fill points, air cleaner, washer bottle and visual check indicators.
The hinged cooling pack provides easy access to not only the radiator

and air conditioner, but also the transmission and hydraulic cooler.

The 426F2 carries on the Cat Backhoe Loader tradition with sealed for life

axle oscillating pins, axle and driveshaft U-joints. Daily checks that can be

time consuming for a busy operator are kept to a minimum on the 426F2.

Cat Product LinkTM system provides remote reporting of machine location

and hours.
