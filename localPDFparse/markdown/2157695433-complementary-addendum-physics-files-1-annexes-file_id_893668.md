**General Information**

**Product Characteristics**

The BIRD-FLIGHT Diverter is designed to make
overhead lines and guyed structures visible to
birds and provides an economical means of
reducing the likelihood of bird collisions with the
conductor, shield wire or cable.

BIRD-FLIGHT Diverters are designed to offer the
following advantages:

- Increased conductor/strand profile to provide
enhanced visibility where bird flight paths
are present

The BIRD-FLIGHT Diverter is lightweight, offers
little wind resistance and is easily and quickly
applied by hand. The positive grip of the diverter
on the cable ensures that it remains in the applied position and cannot move along the span
under aeolian vibration or other conditions.

- Long service life without deterioration of
material properties

- Economical and easily applied

- Lightweight

- No moving parts to wear out

**Visibility**

- Minimal wind resistance

The diverter coil section increases the profile
of the cable and is designed to ensure visibility
safety - but avoid an undesirable bulky outline.

- Manufactured from gray or yellow high
impact PVC with UV protection (Contact
PLP for other color/voltage options).

**Material**

**Application Notes**

Manufactured from rigid high impact polyvinyl
chloride (PVC), the BIRD-FLIGHT Diverter
possesses excellent chemical and strength
properties and will retain good physical
characteristics within a wide temperature range.
The performance of the BIRD-FLIGHT Diverter
is not adversely affected by severe weather
conditions. Industrial fumes and salt water will not

degrade the properties of the rigid PVC material.

**Ensure that the correct size BIRD-FLIGHT**

**Diverter is used.** For a detailed installation

description, refer to the application procedure
SP2805.

For optimum results, it’s recommended that BIRDFLIGHT Diverters be placed at 15 foot intervals,
depending upon local conditions. Since wind resistance is limited, more BIRD-FLIGHT Diverters can
be used if desired to ensure adequate visibility
without creating stresses on the line.
