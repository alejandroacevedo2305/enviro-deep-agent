d. ventilation systems which collect vehicle flue gases and discharge them as
waste air into the environment.

2 _Vehicles_ means motor vehicles, aircraft, ships and railways.

3 _Transport infrastructure_ means roads, airfields, railway tracks and other installations where vehicle flue gases are released into the environment as waste air without
being collected.

4 _New installations_ also includes installations which are altered, extended or repaired
if:

a. higher or different emissions are to be expected as a result; or

b. the costs incurred amount to more than half those of a new installation.

5 Ambient air pollution levels are _excessive_ if one or more of the ambient limit values
specified in Annex 7 is exceeded. If no such limit values are specified for a pollutant,
ambient air pollution levels shall be considered excessive if:

a. they endanger human beings, animals, plants or their biological communities
or habitats;

b. a survey establishes that they significantly affect the well-being of a substantial proportion of the population;

c. they damage buildings; or

d. they harm soil fertility, vegetation or waters.

6 _Placing on the market_ means the transfer or disposal for the first time, whether or
not for consideration, of equipment or machines for distribution or use in Switzerland.
Equivalent to placing on the market is the commissioning, for the first time, of equipment or machines at one's own enterprise in cases where placing on the market has
not previously occurred. [3]

# Chapter 2 Emissions

## Section 1 Limitation of Emissions from New Stationary Installations

### Art. 3 Preventive limiting of emissions in accordance with Annexes 1-4

1 New stationary installations shall be equipped and operated in such a way that they
comply with the emission limits specified in Annex 1.

2 Additional or different requirements apply in the case of the following installations:

a. installations listed in Annex 2: the requirements specified therein;

b. combustion installations: the requirements specified in Annex 3;

3 Amended by No I of the O of 18 June 2010, in force since 15 July 2010 (AS **2010** 2965).

Air Pollution Control. O

**814.318.142.1**

c. [4] construction machines and particle filter systems as specified in Article 19 _a_,

and machines and equipment with internal combustion engines as specified in
Article 20 _b_ : the requirements specified in Annex 4.

### Art. 4 Preventive emission limits specified by the authorities

1 Emissions for which no limit is specified in this Ordinance or for which a particular
limit is declared not to apply, shall be limited preventively by the authorities as far as
is technically and operationally feasible and economically acceptable.

2 Emission limitation measures are technically and operationally feasible if they:

a. have been successfully tested at comparable installations in Switzerland or
abroad; or

b. have been successfully applied in experiments and can be transferred to other
installations from a technological perspective.

3 The assessment of the economic acceptability of emission limitations shall be based
on an average, economically sound enterprise in the relevant sector. If a particular
sector contains widely differing classes of enterprises, the assessment shall be based
on an average enterprise of the relevant class.

### Art. 5 Stricter emission limits ordered by the authorities

1 If an individual planned installation is expected to cause excessive ambient air pollution levels even though the preventive emission limitation requirements are met, the
authorities shall order additional or stricter emission limitation requirements for the
installation concerned.

2 The emission limitation requirements are to be supplemented or tightened to such an
extent that no excessive ambient air pollution levels are caused.

### Art. 6 Capture and removal of emissions [5]

1 Emissions shall be captured as fully and as close to the source as possible and shall
be removed in such a way as to prevent excessive ambient air pollution levels. [6]

2 They shall generally be discharged above roof level via stacks or waste air ducts.

3 Annex 6 applies to stacks. If the required stack height H cannot be realised, or if the
parameter H 0 is more than 100 m, the authorities shall as an alternative tighten the
emission limitation requirements specified in Annexes 1-3.

## Section 2

**Limitation of Emissions from Existing Stationary Installations**

### Art. 7 Preventive limiting of emissions

The provisions concerning the preventive limiting of emissions from new stationary
installations (Articles 3, 4 and 6) also apply to existing stationary installations.

### Art. 8 Mandatory retrofitting

1 The authorities shall ensure that existing stationary installations which do not meet
the requirements of this Ordinance undergo retrofitting.

2 They shall issue the necessary rulings, specifying the time limit for retrofitting in
accordance with Article 10. If necessary, they shall order operating restrictions or the
shutdown of the installation for the duration of the retrofitting work. [7]

3 Retrofitting need not be carried out if the owner undertakes to shut down the installation within the time limit set for retrofitting.

### Art. 9 Stricter emission limits

1 If it is established that an individual existing installation is causing excessive ambient air pollution levels even if the preventive emission limitation requirements are
complied with, the authorities shall order additional or stricter emission limitation requirements for the installation concerned.

2 The emission limitation requirements are to be supplemented or tightened to such an
extent that excessive ambient air pollution levels are no longer caused.

3 The additional or stricter emission limitation requirements are to be imposed by
means of retrofitting rulings with time limits set in accordance with Article 10, paragraph 2. If necessary, the authorities shall order operating restrictions or the shutdown
of the installation for the duration of the retrofitting work.

4 If excessive ambient air pollution levels are caused by more than one installation,
the procedure specified in Articles 31-34 shall be followed.

### Art. 10 [8] Time limits for retrofitting

1 The standard time limit for retrofitting is five years.

2 Shorter time limits, but not less than 30 days, shall be set if:

a. retrofitting can be carried out without significant investments;

b. emissions are more than three times the value specified for the preventive limiting of emissions; or

Air Pollution Control. O

**814.318.142.1**

c. ambient air pollution levels caused by the installation alone are excessive.

3 Longer time limits, up to a maximum of ten years, shall be set if:

a. emissions are less than one-and-a-half times the value applicable for the preventive limiting of emissions, or the provisions concerning flue gas losses are
not complied with; and

b. neither letter a nor letter c of paragraph 2 is met.

4 The above is without prejudice to the ordering of shorter time limits for retrofitting
in accordance with Article 32.

### Art. 11 Relief

1 On request, the authorities shall grant relief to the owner of an installation if retrofitting in accordance with Articles 8 and 10 would be disproportionate, in particular
not technically or operationally feasible, or economically unacceptable.

2 By way of relief, the authorities may in the first instance grant longer time limits. If
the granting of longer time limits is not sufficient, the authorities shall specify less
strict emission limits.

## Section 3 Control of Stationary Installations

### Art. 12 Emission declaration

1 Any person who operates or wishes to construct an installation which causes air pollution shall provide the authorities with information on:

a. the type and level of emissions;

b. the release location, release height and time course of emissions;

c. other release conditions required for the assessment of emissions.

2 The emission declaration may be based on measurements or on material balances of
the substances used.

### Art. 13 Emission measurements and inspections

1 The authorities shall monitor compliance with emission limitation requirements.
They shall carry out their own emission measurements or inspections or shall have
these carried out on their behalf.

2 If possible, the first measurement (acceptance measurement) or inspection must be
carried out within three months, but no later than twelve months after the commissioning of the new or retrofitted installation. The foregoing is without prejudice to
different provisions in Annex 3. [9]

9 Amended by No I of the O of 11 April 2018, in force since 1 June 2018 (AS **2018** 1687).

**814.318.142.1**

Protection of the Ecological Balance

3 The measurement or inspection is generally to be repeated as follows, without prejudice to provisions to the contrary specified in Annexes 2, 3 and 4:

a. every four years for wood-fired boilers as specified in Annex 5 Number 31
paragraph 1 letter a, b or d Number 1 with a rated thermal input of up to 70
kW and for gas-fired installations with a rated thermal input of up to 1 MW;

b. every two years for other combustion installations

c. [10] every three years for other installations. [11 ]

4 In the case of installations which may produce significant levels of emissions, the
authorities shall order continuous measurement and recording of emissions, or of another operating parameter which permits emission control.

### Art. 13 a [12] Proof of the knowledge of the recognised rules of metrology

1 Where an authority arranges for emission measurements and inspections in terms of
Article 13 to be carried out by third parties, it must regularly check whether the third
party concerned has sufficient knowledge of the recognised rules of metrology.

2 The authority may dispense with the regular check under paragraph 1 if the third
party only carries out measurements and inspections for which simplified measurement procedures are provided.

### Art. 14 Measurement procedures

1 The measurements must cover the operating conditions which are relevant for assessment purposes. If necessary, the authorities shall specify the type and extent of
measurements required and the operating conditions to be covered.

2 Emission measurements shall be carried out according to the recognised rules of
metrology. The Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) shall issue recommendations on carrying out the measurements. The technical requirements for measurement
systems and measurement stability are those specified in the Ordinance of 15 February 2006 [13] on Measuring Instruments and the implementing provisions issued by the
Federal Department of Justice and Police. [14]

3 The owner of the installation to be inspected shall set up and make accessible suitable measuring stations in accordance with instructions issued by the authorities.

4 The measured and calculated values, the measurement methods used and the operating conditions at the installation at the time the measurements were performed shall
be recorded in a measurement report.

**814.318.142.1**

1 The measured values shall be corrected to the reference values specified in Annex 1
Number 23.

2 Unless otherwise specified in Annexes 1-4, the values calculated in accordance with
paragraph 1 are to be expressed as hourly mean values for the assessment. In justified
cases, the authorities may specify other suitable averaging periods.

3 In the case of approval and control measurements, emission control requirements
shall be regarded as having been complied with if none of the mean values determined
in accordance with paragraph 2 exceeds the limit value.

4 In the case of continuous measurements, emission limit values shall be regarded as
having been complied with if, within a calendar year:

a. none of the daily mean values exceeds the emission limit value;

b. 97% of all the hourly mean values are no more than 1.2 times the limit value;
and

c. none of the hourly mean values is more than twice the limit value.

5 The authorities shall take account of the particular circumstances when assessing
emissions during start-up and shut-down periods.

### Art. 16 Bypass lines and malfunctions and lack of availability of chemicals

for flue gas cleaning [15]

1 A bypass line may only be used to protect flue gas cleaning systems with the approval of the authorities.

2 If significant emissions could occur as a result of the use of bypass lines or during
malfunctions, the authorities shall specify what measures are to be taken.

3 The authorities may specify lower emission limits for fixed installations if it is
proven that the chemicals required to operate the flue gas cleaning systems are not
available. Lower emission limits are not permitted for highly toxic or carcinogenic
substances. [16]

## Section 4 Emissions from Vehicles and Transport Infrastructure

### Art. 17 Preventive limiting of emissions from vehicles

In accordance with legislation on road transport, aviation, shipping and railways, preventive measures shall be taken to control emissions from vehicles as far as is technically and operationally feasible and economically acceptable.

### 2 They are without prejudice to the additional or different provisions applicable for:

a. particular installations, as specified in Annex 2;

b. combustion installations, as specified in Annex 3;

c. type-approval of combustion installations, as specified in Annex 4.

### 2 Definitions

#### 21 Flue gases

_Flue gases_ means waste air, flue gases and other air pollutants discharged by installations.

#### 22 Emissions

Emissions are expressed in the following terms:

a. Concentration:
Mass of emitted substance in relation to the volume of flue gas (e.g. in milligrams per cubic metre [mg/m [3] ]);

b. Mass flow:
Mass of emitted substance per unit time (e.g. in grams per hour [g/h]);

e. Smoke number:
The degree of filter blackening caused by flue gases. The grey scale used to
determine the Bacharach smoke number ranges from 0 to 9 in unit steps.

#### 23 Reference value for emission concentrations

1 The limit values expressed as concentrations and the oxygen contents given as reference values are based on the volume of flue gas under standard conditions (0 °C,
1013 mbar) after deduction of the moisture content (dry).

#### 2 The limit values expressed as emission concentrations are based on the amount of

flue gas which is no more heavily diluted than is technically and operationally unavoidable.

### 3 If oxygen content by volume is given as the reference value for an installation listed

in Annexes 2-4, the measured emission concentrations are to be corrected to this reference value.

#### 24 Rated thermal input

The rated thermal input is the maximum thermal energy that can be supplied to an
installation per unit time. It is obtained by multiplying the fuel consumption of the
installation by the lower calorific value of the fuel.

### 3 General provisions

#### 31 Limitation of emissions

1 The following emission limitation requirements apply:

a. for dust: Number 4;

b. for inorganic substances, mainly in the form of dust: Number 5;

c. for inorganic substances in gaseous or vaporous form: Number 6;

d. for organic substances in gaseous, vaporous or particulate form: Number 7;

e. for carcinogens: Number 8.

#### 2 Substances not listed in Numbers 5-8 shall be assigned to the substance classes

which have comparable effects on the environment. Account shall be taken in particular of degradability and bio-accumulability, toxicity, the effects of decomposition
processes and transformation products, and odour intensity.

#### 32 Limitation of emissions dependent on installation size

1 If there is more than one emission source and if emission limitation requirements
depend on the size of an installation (e.g. capacity or mass flow), the authorities shall

22 / 92

Air Pollution Control. O

**814.318.142.1**

determine which emission sources shall collectively be considered to constitute a single installation.

2 Emission sources are generally to be considered as a single installation if they are
situated in close proximity to each other and if their emissions:

a. essentially contain the same or similar pollutants; or

b. can be reduced using the same technology.

3 Parts of an installation which only serve as back-ups in the event of malfunctions
are not taken into account when determining the size of the installation.

### 4 Emission limit values which depend on a certain mass flow shall only apply if:

a. this mass flow is reached or exceeded for more than five hours per week; or

b. double this mass flow is reached or exceeded for a shorter period.

### 4 Dust

#### 41 Limit value for total dust

If the mass flow of dust is 0.20 kg/h or more, total dust emissions must not exceed 20
mg/m [3] .

#### 42 Limitation of exposure to components of dust

The requirements specified in Numbers 5, 7 and 8 apply for the limitation of exposure
to individual components of dust.

#### 43 Measures relating to treatment, storage, trans-shipment and

**transport**

1 If significant dust emissions may occur in commercial or industrial facilities as a
result of processes such as the conveyance, crushing, sorting or filling of dust-forming
materials, the dust-containing flue gases must be captured and fed into a dust removal
system.

2 When dust-forming materials are stored or trans-shipped in the open, measures must
be taken to prevent significant dust emissions.

3 When dust-forming materials are transported, transport equipment must be used
which prevents significant dust emissions.

### 4 If traffic on factory roads may cause significant dust emissions, the roads must be

kept free of dust.

## Minimum stack height

### 1 Scope

**814.318.142.1**

# Annex 6 [101]

(Art. 6 para. 3)

The provisions of this Annex apply to installations for which the quantity Q/S exceeds
5, where:

Q = mass flow of the emitted air pollutant in grams per hour;

S = value calculated in accordance with Number 9.

### 2 Calculation method 1 The required physical stack height is calculated step by step in accordance with

Numbers 3 to 6.

### 2 If more than one air pollutant is emitted, the physical stack height is calculated on

the basis of the pollutant for which the quantity Q/S has the highest value.

### 3 Parameter H 0

#### 31 Determination of H 0 according to Diagram 1

### 1 The parameter H 0 takes account of the short-term effects of the air pollutants emitted

from a single installation. It is determined with the aid of Diagram 1.

### 2 The quantities Q and F depend on the emission conditions at the installation. The

full load values and the fuel/emission conditions most conducive to air pollution are
used to calculate H 0 .

### 3 The quantity S is used to limit the maximum short-term ambient air pollution levels

caused by the installation to a specific value (S value). The S values specified in Number 9 are used to calculate H 0 .

#### 32 Determination of H 0 in individual cases

### 1 The parameter H 0 is determined in individual cases according to the recognised rules

for calculating the stack height and the dispersion of flue gases if:

a. the Q/S or F values lie outside Diagram 1; or

b. the flue gas temperature is less than 55 °C.

### 2 However, where flue gas temperatures are below 55 °C, the parameter H 0 must not

be lower than the value which is obtained according to Diagram 1 for a temperature
of 55 °C.

**814.318.142.1**

Protection of the Ecological Balance

### 4 Minimum height for flat, obstacle-free terrain

1 The stack height for flat, obstacle-free terrain is:
H 1 = f x H 0
The correction factor f takes account of long-term effects due to wind channelling.

2 Values between 1.0 and 1.5 are used for f as follows:

f = 1.00 for sites with no prevailing wind direction;

f = 1.25 for sites with average conditions;

f = 1.50 for valleys with pronounced wind channelling.

3 Intermediate values are also possible for f, depending on the site conditions.

### 5 Height increase for buildings and vegetation

Elevated objects (buildings and vegetation) in the vicinity of the stack are taken into
account by means of a height increase I 1 :

I 1 = g x I

where:

I = Height of the highest significant obstacle area in the region affected by the
installation. Values between 0 (no obstacles) and 30 m (e.g. forest) are used
for I.

g = Correction factor, with values between 0 and 1 according to Diagram 2.

### 6 Physical stack height

The physical stack height H is calculated according to the following formula:

H = H 1 + I 1

### 7 More stringent requirements

In justified cases, the authorities will require taller stacks, for example, in the case of:

a. structures with particular shapes;

b sites with particularly poor meteorological dispersion conditions;

c. particular topographical conditions, such as narrow valleys, hillsides or depressions.
