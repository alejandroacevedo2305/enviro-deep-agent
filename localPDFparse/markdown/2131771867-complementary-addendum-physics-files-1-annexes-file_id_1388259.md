# Open-area Smoke Imaging Detection (OSID)

#### Large, open spaces - warehouses, airports, train stations, stadiums and shopping malls - pose unique challenges to reliable fire detection due to their environmental nature and limitations.

##### Open-area Smoke Detection Reinvented

OSID by Xtralis is a new technology designed specifically for these environments, enabling early detection and response to

save lives and prevent service disruptions.

OSID uses a sophisticated algorithm to map and compare the strength of infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) light signals from

detectors configured in the area.

OSID also reduces the costs of installation thanks the ball and socket arrangement with simple laser screwdriver alignment.

The Emitters come both battery powered and wired.

##### Superior Features Offered by OSID

- Patented dual wavelength, UV & IR, particle detection

- CMOS imager with wide viewing angles

- Simple installation, commissioning and maintenance - up to

70% time saving compared to traditional beams

- High tolerance to vibration and structural movement and high

airflow

- High resistance to dust, fogging, steam, reflections and

object intrusion

##### .2(#Ø"NMÚFTQ@SHNMR

OSID systems may be configured to

protect a range of spaces, regardless of

shape. The protection zone or “fire web”

is determined by the placement of OSID

detectors. Multi-emitter solutions provide

a true 3D arrangement.

- High resistance to reflected sunlight

- Requires as little as 20 x 20 cm (8x8“) unobstructed width of

view

- On-board log memory for fault and alarm diagnostics

- Software tool for diagnostic purposes

- Aesthetically discreet and 3D coverage

- Long range up to 150 m (492 ft)

##### 6GDQDØ%KDWHAKDØ#DSDBSHNMØ"NUDQ@FDØHRØ-DDCDC

OSID can support up to 7 Emitters with a single Imager making it easy to deploy in unusually shaped areas. Emitters can be

placed at different heights to overcome stratification and provide earlier detection. This Multi-Emitter 3D approach also

provides a 50% better detection coverage because beams converging to one point are more closely spaced in the area.

##### 4MHPTDØ#DSDBSHNMØ3DBGMNKNFX

OSID by Xtralis innovatively combines two technologies to reliably detect smoke in large, open spaces.

**Dual-wavelength Particle Detection**

By using two wavelengths of light to detect particles, the system is able to distinguish between particle sizes. The shorter UV

wavelength interacts strongly with both small and large particles, while the longer IR wavelength is affected predominantly by

larger particles. Dual-wavelength path loss measurements therefore enable the detector to provide repeatable smoke

obscuration values, while rejecting the presence of dust particles or solid intruding objects.

**Optical Imaging with CMOS Imager Arrays**

An optical imaging array in the OSID detector provides a wider viewing angle to locate and capture images. Consequently, the

system is easier to install and align and can compensate for drift caused by natural shifts in building structures.

Optical filtering, high-speed image acquisition, and intelligent software algorithms also enable the OSID detector to process

images and provide new levels of stability and sensitivity while providing high tolerance to high-level lighting variability.

OSID Diagnostic is a unique tool in the industry that allows

for live and off-line diagnostic information about the system

and environment.

The operates in Windows on a standard laptop PC and

offers, when connected in the field to the Imager, real time

live visualisation of the normalised UV and IR values (0-100%

obscuration), the UV and IR grey levels, the X-Y positioning

of the 1-7 Emitters on the imager, reference levels and

temperature.

The tools also allows for live and off-line evaluation of the

imager’s log files and reconstruct, with time and date stamp,

any significant changes in the system. Log files can also be

exported to an Excel file for quick analysis and review.
