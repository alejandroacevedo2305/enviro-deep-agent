PRIME POWER (PRP)

Prime power is avalaible for an unlimited number of annual operating hours in variable load applications, in accordance with ISO8528-1.

A 10% overload capability is avalaible for a period of 1 hour within a 12-hour period of operation, in accordance with ISO 3046-1.

STANDBY POWER RATING (ESP)

The Standby Power Rating is applicable for supplying emergency power for the duration of a utility power interruption. No overload, utility parallel or negotiated outage operation capability is

avalaible at this rating.

In installations served by unreliable utility sources (where outages last longer or occur more frequently), where operation is likely to exceed 200 hours per year, the prime power rating should be applied.

The Standby Power rating is only applicable for emergency and standby applications where the generator set serves as the back up to the normal utility source.
