**Structure**

Counter-frame and supports completely calculated by “Finite
Element Analysis” (FEM).
High mixing capacity and maximum output thanks to the optimal
positions of the spiral blades in the drum.
The low center of gravity of the truck-mixer creates an ideal balanced
loads distribution, to obtain better driving position and perfect stability
particularly in narrow bends.The axle-frame and counter-frame
arrangement provides good road adherence, superior
manoeuvrability, as well as improved safety.

**Main Optional**

- [Hydraulic water pump and hydraulic lifting chute]

- [Water tank pressurized type (600-800-950 I)]

- [Cone-shaped discharging chute with end hose diam. 200 mm]

- [Centralized system for roller greasing]

- [Hydraulic pipings emergency kit]

- [Two additional plastic chutes]

- [Cyclist guard twin bars (standard EEC area)]

- [Rubber covering protection between mudguards and mixer frame, ]
plus rubber mudflaps

- [Special painting]

- [Discharging chute hydraulically driven by manual pump]
