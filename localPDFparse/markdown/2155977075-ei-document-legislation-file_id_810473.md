**2.3. Other hazards**

**Emergency overview**

Etiborik Asit is a white odourless, powder/granular substance that is not flammable, combustible, or explosive,
and has low acute oral and dermal toxicity.

**Potential health effects**

Inhalation is the most significant route of exposure in occupational and other settings. Dermal exposure is not
usually a concern because Etiborik Asit is poorly absorbed through intact skin.

**Inhalation**

Occasional mild irritation effects to nose and throat may occur from inhalation of Etiborik Asit dusts at levels
higher than 10 mg/m [3] .

**Eye contact**

Etiborik Asit is non-irritating to eyes in normal industrial use.

**Skin contact**

Etiborik Asit does not cause irritation to intact skin.

Page **3** of **14**

**Ingestion**

Products containing Etiborik Asit are not intended for ingestion. Etiborik Asit has a low acute toxicity. Small
amounts (e.g., a teaspoon) swallowed accidentally are not likely to cause effects; swallowing amounts larger than
that may cause gastrointestinal symptoms.

**Reproductive/developmental**

Animal ingestion studies in several species, at high doses, indicate that borates cause reproductive and
developmental effects [1]. A human study of occupational exposure to borate dust showed no adverse effect on
reproduction. An epidemiological study and a peer reviewing report of the past epidemiological studies conducted
in China didn’t show any negative effect of boron on human fertility [2]. A study conducted in Turkey with boron
exposed mine workers showed that mean blood concentrations of the high exposure group is ~6 times and ~9 times
lower than those of the highest no effect level of boron in blood with regard to developmental and reprotoxic
effects (respectively) in rats. With those findings, no unfavourable effects of boron exposure on reproductive
indicators are observed in humans [3, 4].

**Potential ecological effects**

Large amounts of Etiborik Asit can be harmful to plants and other species. Therefore, releases to the environment
should be minimized.

**Signs and symptoms of exposure**

Symptoms of accidental over-exposure to Etiborik Asit have been associated with ingestion or absorption through
large areas of damaged skin. These may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, with delayed effects of skin
redness and peeling.

Refer to SECTION 11 for details on Toxicological data.

**SECTION 3: Composition / Information on ingredients**

**3.1. Substances**

The product contains greater than 99.9 percent (%) Etiborik Asit (H 3 BO 3 ).

For other "Chemical inventory listing", please refer to SECTION 15.

**SECTION 4: First aid measures**

**4.1. Description of first aid measures**

**Skin contact**

No treatment necessary because Etiborik Asit does not cause irritation to intact skin.

**Eye contact**

No treatment necessary because non-irritant.

**Inhalation**

If symptoms such as nose or throat irritation are observed, remove to fresh air. Etiborik Asit has low inhalation
toxicity.

**Ingestion**

If large amounts are swallowed (i.e. more than one teaspoon), contact a doctor or toxicity centre immediately.

**4.2. Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed**

N.A.

**4.3. Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed.**

Observation only is required for adult ingestion of less than 6 grams of Etiborik Asit. For ingestion in excess of 6
grams, maintain adequate kidney function and force fluids. Gastric lavage is recommended for symptomatic
patients only. Haemodialysis should be reserved for massive acute ingestion or patients with renal failure. Boron
analyses of urine or blood are only useful for documenting exposure and should not be used to evaluate severity
of poisoning or to guide treatment [5] (see SECTION 11).

**SECTION 5: Fire-fighting measures**

**5.1. Extinguishing media**

Any appropriate fire extinguishing media may be used on nearby fires.

**5.2. Special hazards arising from the substance**

Etiborik Asit is not flammable, combustible or explosive. The product is itself a flame retardant.

**5.3. Advice for firefighters**

N.A.

**SECTION 6: Accidental release measures**

**6.1. Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures.**

Avoid dust formation. In case of exposure to prolonged or high level of airborne dust, wear a personal respirator
in compliance with national legislation.

**6.2. Environmental precautions**

Etiborik Asit is a water-soluble white product that may, at high concentrations cause damage to trees or vegetation
by root absorption (see SECTION 12).

**6.3. Methods and material for containment and cleaning up**

**Land spill**

Vacuum, shovel or sweep up Etiborik Asit and place in containers for disposal in accordance with applicable local
regulations. Avoid contamination of water bodies during clean up and disposal. No personal protective equipment
is needed to clean up land spills.

**Spillage into water**

Where possible, remove any intact containers from the water. Advise local water authority that none of the affected
water should be used for irrigation or for the abstraction of potable water until natural dilution returns the boron
value to its normal environmental background level (see SECTIONS 12, 13 and 15).

**6.4. Reference to other sections**

See SECTIONS 8 and 13 for further information.

**SECTION 7: Handling and Storage**

**7.1. Precautions for safe handling**

**SECTION 11: Toxicological information**

**11.1. Information on toxicological effect**

**11.1.1. Substances**

**Acute toxicity**

Low acute oral toxicity; LD50 in rats > 2,600 mg/kg of body weight (Test material: Boron Oxide) [6].

**Skin corrosion/irritation**

Low acute dermal toxicity; LD 50 in rabbits is greater than 2,000 mg/kg of body weight [7]. Boric acid is poorly
absorbed through intact skin. Non-irritant.

**Serious eye damage/irritation**

Boric acid has no eye damage/irritation.

**Respiratory or skin sensitization**

Boric acid has no respiratory or skin sensitization.

**Germcell mutagenicity**

Boric acid is not mutagenic.

**Carcinogenicity**

Boric acid is not carcinogenic.

**Reproductive toxicity**

Animal feeding studies in rat, mouse and dog, at high doses, have demonstrated effects on fertility and testes [1].
Studies with the chemically related boric acid in rat, mouse and rabbit, at high doses, demonstrate developmental
effects on the foetus including foetal weight loss and minor skeletal variations. The doses administered were many
times in excess of those which humans would normally be exposed to [8, 9]. While boron has been shown to
adversely affect male reproduction in laboratory animals, there is no clear evidence of male reproductive effects
attributable to boron in studies of highly exposed workers. Human epidemiological studies show no increase in
pulmonary disease in occupational populations with chronic exposures to borate dusts. A recent epidemiology
study under the conditions of normal occupational exposure to borate dusts indicated no effect on fertility. A study
conducted in Turkey with boron exposed mine workers showed that mean blood concentrations of the high
exposure group is ~6 times and ~9 times lower than those of the highest no effect level of boron in blood with

Page **8** of **14**

regard to developmental and reprotoxic effects (respectively) in rats. With those findings, no unfavorable effects
of boron exposure on reproductive indicators are observed in humans [3, 4].

**STOT-single exposure**

N.A.

**STOT-repeated exposure**

N.A.

**Aspiration hazard**

Boric acid has no aspiration hazard.

**SECTION 12: Ecological information**

**12.1. Toxicity**

Boron occurs naturally in sea water at an average concentration of 5 mg B/L and fresh water at 1 mg B/L or less.
In dilute aqueous solutions the predominant boron species present is undissociated boric acid. To convert boric
acid into equivalent boron (B) content, multiply by 0.1748.

**Phytotoxicity**

Boron is an essential micronutrient for healthy growth of plants; however, it can be harmful to boron sensitive
plants in higher quantities. Care should be taken to minimise the amount of borate product released to the
environment.

**Algal toxicity**

Green algae, _Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata_

72-hr EC 50 -biomass = 40 mg B/L or 229 mg boric acid/L [10]

**Invertebrate toxicity** **[(7)]**

Daphnia, Daphnids, _Daphnia magna_

48-hr LC 50 = 133 mg B/L or 760 mg boric acid/L [11]

**Fish toxicity**

Fish, Fathered minnow, _Pimephales promelas_

96-hr LC 50 = 79.7 mg B/L or 456 mg boric acid/L [12]

**12.2. Persistence and degradability**

Boron is naturally occurring and ubiquitous in the environment. Boric acid decomposes in the environment to
natural borate.

**12.3. Bioaccumulative potential**

Not bioacumulative.

**12.4. Mobility in soil**

**SECTION 15: Regulatory information**

**15.1. Safety, health and environmental regulations/legislation specific for the substance**

It should be noted that borates are safe under conditions of normal handling and use, besides, they are essential
nutrients to plants, and research shows that they play a beneficial role in human health. CLP classification has
been solely based on animal tests where animals were exposed to high doses of boric acid over long periods of
time. These doses were many times higher than humans are exposed to under conditions of normal handling and
use. Consequently, a precautionary decision was taken by the European Commission. Although we will comply
with the body of legislation triggered by that decision, we are in process of all possible legal actions.

**Clean Air Act (Montreal Protocol)**

Boric acid was not manufactured with and does not contain any Class I or Class II ozone depleting substances.

**Cosmetics**

The EC Directive 76/768/EEC sets an upper limit of 5% Boric acid in talcs, 0.5% in oral hygiene products and 3%
in other products. In addition, the talcs should not be used on children under 3 years of age.

**German Water Hazard Class (WGK):** Substances and mixtures can pose a hazard to water bodies. To
protect the water bodies from detrimental changes to their characteristics it is required that substances and mixtures
that are handled or stored in facilities in Germany are classified for their water hazard properties.

Classification is carried out on the basis of the Ordinance on facilities for handling substances that are hazardous
[to water (Verordnung über Anlagen zum Umgang mit wassergefährdenden Stoffen (AwSV)) of 18 April 2017](https://www.chemsafetypro.com/Topics/EU/Introduction_to_German_Ordinance_on_Facilities_Handling_Substances_that_are_Hazardous_to_Water_AwSV.html)
(BGBI 2017, Teil I, Nr. 22, Seite 905).

There are three water hazard classes (WGK).

1: slightly hazardous to water

2: obviously hazardous to water

3: highly hazardous to water

Boric acid has been classified as WGK 1: slightly hazardous to water.

Boric acid Reg. No: 315.
