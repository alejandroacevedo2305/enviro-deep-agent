## HUSQVARNA AX/VIBRASTAR SERIES | HIGH FREQUENCY ELECTRIC VIBRATORS

# FOR LARGE SLABS AND LONG SHIFTS

Husqvarna AX vibrators are light and maneuverable,

easy to use and powered for the toughest jobs. These

vibrators are ideal when many are to be used in parallel,

since one frequency converter can run up to four vibrators

simultaneously. There’s an AX vibrator for almost any

application. From high to low slump concrete, from thin

beams to extensive foundations.

The electric motor-in-head design provides the vibrator

head with outstanding performance, high power and stable

speed. Rapid acceleration helps minimize air voids within

the concrete and transports them to the surface. An easy
to-operate, robust aluminum toggle switch is standard.

Husqvarna Vibrastar are cost-effective vibrators for less

challenging applications. The reliable and sturdy vibrators

are designed for medium to high slump concrete. The easy
to-use aluminium switchbox offers one-hand operation and

reduced hand/arm vibration. That means you’ll be able to

work longer without getting tired.
The dual fiber layers in the hose, and oil lubricated

bearings in the vibrator, provide improved durability without

the need for periodic maintenance. As for maintenance, our

service-friendly design makes it really easy for you to

replace bearings.

High induction
hardened steel parts.

**USER FRIENDLY**

AZ comes with a 5 metre hose.

**RELIABILITY**

Longer pendulum shaft turning in
a bearing conical raceway extends
lifetime with higher centrifugal

force involved.
