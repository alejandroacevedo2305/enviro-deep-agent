Notes:

1 Limited single phase capability is available from some three phase rated configurations. To obtain single phase rating, multipy the three phase
kW rating by the Single Phase Factor 3 . All single phase ratings are at unity power factor.

2 Standby (S), Prime (P) and Continuous ratings (C).

3 Factor for the Single Phase Output from Three Phase Alternator formula listed below.

4 Maximum rated starting kVA that results in a minimum of 90% of rated sustained voltage during starting.

Formulas for calculating full load currents:

Three phase output Single phase output

kW x 1000 kW x SinglePhaseFactor x 1000
Voltage x 1.73 x 0.8 Voltage
