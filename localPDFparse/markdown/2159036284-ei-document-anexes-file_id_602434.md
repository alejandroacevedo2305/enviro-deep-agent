## BACKSHEET MONOCRYSTALLINE MODULE

# 670W 0~+5W

MAXIMUM POWER OUTPUT POSITIVE POWER TOLERANCE

High customer value

Mono Multi Solutions

PRODUCT: TSM-DE21

POWER RANGE: 645-670W

# 21.6%

MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY

- Lower LCOE (Levelized Cost Of Energy), reduced BOS (Balance of

System) cost, shorter payback time

- Lowest guaranteed first year and annual degradation;

- Designed for compatibility with existing mainstream system

components

High power up to 670W

- Up to 21.6% module efficiency with high density interconnect

technology

- Multi-busbar technology for better light trapping effect, lower

series resistance and improved current collection

High reliability

- Minimized micro-cracks with innovative non-destructive cutting

technology

- Ensured PID resistance through cell process and module material

control

- Resistant to harsh environments such as salt, ammonia, sand, high

temperature and high humidity areas

- Mechanical performance up to 5400 Pa positive load and 2400 Pa

negative load

High energy yield

- Excellent IAM (Incident Angle Modifier) and low irradiation

performance, validated by 3rd party certifications

- The unique design provides optimized energy production under

inter-row shading conditions

- Lower temperature coefficient (-0.34%) and operating temperature
