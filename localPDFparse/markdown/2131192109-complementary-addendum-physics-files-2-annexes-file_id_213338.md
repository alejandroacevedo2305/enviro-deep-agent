ABSTRACT: The ratio between oxygen supply and oxygen demand was examined as a predictor of
benthic response to organic enrichment caused by salmon net-pen aquaculture. Oxygen supply to the
benthos was calculated based on Fickian diffusion and near-bottom flow velocities. A strong linear
correlation was found between measured carbon sedimentation rates and rates of benthic metabolism.
This relationship allowed an estimation of oxygen demand based on sedimentation rates. Comparison
of several production sites in Maine (USA) coastal waters showed that for sites where oxygen demand
exceeded supply benth~c impacts were high and for sltes where oxygen supply exceeded demand
benthic impacts were low These findings wrl-e s~~mmanzed In the form of a predict~ve model that
should be useful in siting salmon production fac~litles

**INTRODUCTION**

As salmonid net-pen culture has become increasingly prevalent in marine near-shore environments so
has concern for potential environmental damage.

Numerous studies have demonstrated alterations of

the benthos beneath and proximal to net-pens
(Table 1). Effects are generally restricted to within
30 m of the pens and the magnitude of the effects has
been categorized from 'no gross impact' (e.g. Frid &
Mercer 1989) to 'highly eutrophicated' (e.g. Hall et al.
1990). Although effects have been documented, interpretation has been on a site by site basis due, in part, to
the failure of linear models to relate benthic loading to
benthic impacts, as well as the assun~ption that a single
benthic assimilative capacity is applicable to all sea
bottoms (e.g. Silvert 1992). It is clear that the first 7

effects documented in Table 1 are either direct or in

direct consequences of increased benthic metabolism.
Recent developments in our understanding of benthicpelagic coupling suggest these responses can be
dlrectly linked to increases in carbon flux to the
benthos (Nixon 1981, Hargrave 1984, Sampou & Oviatt
1991, Kemp & Boynton 1992, Hatcher et al. 1994).
The 2 main processes associated with organic matter
degradation in, shallow-water marine systems are the
delivery of particulate organic matter from the water
column to the benthos, and benthic decomposition and
resulting solute fluxes. Recent developments in sediment trap technologies have greatly improved our
ability to measure benthic carbon flux. Cylindrical
traps should have the appropriate diameter to match
the flow characteristics of the environment and aspect
ratios _>3.5_ to minimize trap sampling bias (Butman
1986, Butman et al. 1986, Baker et al. 1988). In shallowwater systems resuspension followed by settling can
confound measurements of deposition, but a comparison of the organic and inorganic content of sediments
can be used to correct for the effect of resuspension on
deposition rates (Kemp & Boynton 1992).

In several manipulative experiments, marine sediments enriched with organic matter showed increases
in total benthic metabolism measured as CO2 flux from

and 0, flux to the benthos (Anderson & Hargrave 1984,
Keplay & Andersen 1985, Schwinghamer & Keplay
1987, Sampou & Oviatt 1991, Schwinghamer et al.
1991). In most of these experiments water movement
was restricted and enrichment was sufficient to generate a n oxygen demand greater than the supply deliverable by diffusion. Decomposition was mediated by
anaerobic processes and virtually all oxygen consumption could be related to the reoxidation of reduced

alternative electron acceptors. Under these conditions
natural sediments will be devoid of macrofauna and

sulfide-oxidizing bacteria will form mats at the watersediment interface.

We reasoned that if the ability of the benthos to oxidize organic matter aerobically could be determined
and compared to the organic flux originating from the
nei-pens, a prediction of benthic impact would result
As the State of Maine, USA (site of our study) has
chosen the occurrence of azoic conditions or the devel
opment of Beggiatoa sp. mats as defining an unaccept
able benthic im.pact (Sowles et al. 1.994), we chose
these criteria as the endpoints of our model and
focused on the factors that control the balance between

aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in marine sedi
m e n t ~ . We broke the problem of siting net-pens into 2
halves. (1) predicting the impact of a known benthic
carbon flux and (2) predicting a _prior1_ the fl.ux from a
net-pen system. Both are very sign~ficant problems
and we have chosen to deal with the first in this manu

script. The purpose of this paper is to descrlbe the
theoretical basis of our model and the relationship
between benthic organic matter loading and benthic
metabolism as it relates to sediments proximal to
several salmon net-pens in Maine coastal waters. We
have developed our model of benthic impact associated with net-pen aquaculture using 2 parametersoxygen supply to the sediments and sediment oxygen
demand. We assumed that benthic metabolism, and
therefore maximum sediment oxygen demand, would
be limited by the maximum rate of oxygen delivery to
the sediments We calculated oxygen supply by assuming delivery by Fickian diffusion, using 3 key environmental variables: (1) flow velocity, (2) temperature,
and (3) oxygen concentration of the bottom water.
Sediment oxygen demand was predicted from measured carbon sedimentation rates as they related to

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study sites. We studied 3 salmon net-pen facilities
within Maine coastal waters (Fig. 1). The sites were:
(1) 2 individual net-pens located on a single lease site
in Toothacher Cove, Swans Island, (2) an erosional site
in Eastport and (3) a depositional site in Eastport

Only cores that showed no signs of sediment resuspension were accepted for analysis.

Physical and production data. Recording current
meters (Endeco Model 105) were moored 1 m from
the bottom at all sites and refreshed monthly. These
meters provided an average curl-ent velocity and direction every 30 min. The minimum current veloclty
detected by these meters was typically 0.15 to 0.30 cm

S - ' Meters were calibrated before each use. Water

depths, sediment granulometry, temperature data, the
number and weight of fish per pen, the number, size,
configuration and orientation of the pens in use, and
the siz,e and type of food being fed were (when posslble) obtained from the firms involved and corroborated, when possible, by diver observations.

Organic matter deposition. Carbon deposition was
measured using sediment traps. Trap construction
incorporated the latest technological suggestions (Butman 1986, Butman et al. 1986, Baker et al. 1988) and
were designed to minimize sampllng bias. Butman has
clearly shown that the critical parameter is the relationship of trap diameter to current velocity. As such,
we constructed traps from clear polycarbonate tubing,
and matched trap diameter to the current velocity at
each study site. Traps were either 37.5 cm in height
and 10 cm in diameter (aspect ratio 3.75) and, at lowflow stu.dy sites, produced an appropriate Reynolds'
number (Rt = 1 X 104) or were 37.5 cm in height and
6.5 cm in diameter (aspect ratio 5.77) and, at high-flow
study sites, produced a similar Reynolds' number.
Traps were placed in swivel-mounted holders with the
trap mouth 1 m above the sediment-water interface.
Due to the long trap deployment times (- 30 d), material collected in the traps was preserved with salt
(TX-10, Akzo Salt, Inc.). The trapped material was
sieved (500 pm) to remove animals (e.g. copepods) that
swam into the traps and were killed. Sieving also
removed detritus >500 pm. The removal of the
>500 pm fraction decreased measured ambient and
pen carbon flux ratcs by 10 to 100% (depending on
time of year), but the vast majority of this fraction was
dead zooplankton. No significant differences in the
carbon and nitrogen content of the >500 pm fraction
from pen and ambient traps were detected. The
amount of material collected in the traps was determined gravimetrically, corrected for any remaining
salts, and total organic carbon and nitrogen content
determined using a Carlo Erba elemental analyzer
Sediment samples were first treated with fumes of
hydrochloric acid to remove any inorganic carbon
(usually present as calcium carbonate). Carbon deposition rates were corrected for sediment resuspension by

assuming that all ash present within the trap originated from seabed sediment. The amount of carbon

entering the trap due to resuspension of sediment was
###### then estimated as. Carbon, .,,,, = (Trap ash content

duplicate traps was typically less than 10%

mination~ of oxygen uptake rates was typically less

typically less than 25 $4
Data presentation and analysis. Oxygen uptake,
CC02 production and carbon deposition rates are
reported in the literature using a variety of units. To
facilitate comparison between the various rates we
have reported all rate measurements in units of mm01
m-' d-'. The relationships between O2 uptake, l C O z
production and carbon deposltlon were determlned
by linear regression analysis. As O2 consumption and
I C 0 2 production were both measured during the determination of benthic metabolism, data from individual cores were compared. The relationship between carbon flux to the sedlments and benthlc

metabolism was also determ~ned by linear regression,
but using mean values. The carbon flux to the sedlment was determined using sediment traps (mean of 2
traps) deployed for 10 to 30 d prior to the determination

of benthic metabolism. This val.ue was compared to the
mean (3 replicate analyses) O2 consumption or ECO2
production rates for that station at the date of the
recovery of the sediment traps. Only 6 data points out
of a possible 11 (4 were lost and 1 excluded) were used
for the comparison of carbon sedimentation rate to
ZC02 production due to losses of 1 C 0 2 production
samples and exclusion of stations when Beggiatoatype mats were present (chemosynthetic activity
strongly skewed ZC02 fluxes).
Oxygen supply to the benthos. We predicted maximum rates of benthic oxygen supply using Fick's first
law:

J = _`D`_ (C, - CO) _lz,,_ (1)

where D is the molecular diffusion coefficient of the

solute at the ambient temperature (in m2 h-'); C, and
_**`CO`**_ are the solute concentrations in the bulk water and

at the interface, respectively (in mm01 m-3); and _Zd_
is the thickness of the diffusion boundary layer (in m).
The average thickness of the diffusive boundary layer
_`(Z,,)`_ for current velocities between 0.3 and 7 cm S-' and
the O2 molecular diffusion constant at 15OC (D) were
obtained from the literature (Jargensen 1989, Broecker
& Peng 1974, respectively). Oxygen concentra.tions at
15°C at saturation and zero were used for C, and CO,
respectively.

**RESULTS**

Oxygen supply to the benthos

Field measurements supported the assumption of 0,
saturation for the bulk water. The relationship between flow velocity and the predicted maximum rates
of benthic oxygen supply by molecular diffusion was
non-linear with greatest increases in flux occurring at
the lowest current velocities (Fig. 2). We consider this
prediction accurate within a narrow range of key environmental parameters but an underestimation for most
sediments. We consider it valuable because many sedi m e n t ~ proximal to net-pens are constrained such that
the prediction is accurate, at least during key periods
of the tidal cycle.

Benthic carbon deposition rates and

Carbon sedimentation rates at ambient sites ranged
from 73.4 to 195.8 mm01 m-2 d-'. Carbon sedimentation

rates at sites proximal to net-pens ranged from 108.0 to

were made to between 73.4 and 554.9 mm01 m-2 d-l.

Benthic metabolism was measured in 2 ways in this
study; **O2** flux rates and XC02 production rates.
Measured oxygen uptake rates ranged from 29.0 to
100.0 mm01 m-2 d-' i n ambient sediments and 107.9 to

581.8 mm01 m-2 d-' in sediments proximal to net-pens.
Carbon flux rates from sediments distal to the pens
ranged from 42 to 167 mm01 C m-2 d-' while flux rates
from sediments proximal to salmon net-pens ranged
from 152 to 384 mm01 C m-? `d-'` There was a strong
linear relationship (r2 = 0.965) between organic carbon
flux to sediment and benthic oxygen consumption
(Fig. 3). The molar ratio of carbon flux to the benthos to
0, flux was near unity and this relationship was dominated by net-pen sediments. There was a strong 1:l
molar ratio (slope = 1.084, r2 = 0.936) between the average daily carbon flux to the sediments and the benthic
metabolism as estimated by I C O z production if sediments covered with Beggiatoa-type mats were not
included in the analysis (Fig. **4).**
Measurements of oxygen uptake and CC02 production showed the most complex relationship. If sediments both proximal and distal to net-pens with O2
fluxes of <l50 m.mol O2 m-2 d-' were considered, then
a strong linear relationship (r2 = 0.697) between these
2 parameters was observed (Fig. 5a). The average
respiratory quotient for these stations was 1.41. If all
sediments proximal to the net-pens except those
covered with Beggiatoa-type mats were included in

The 4 net-pen locations were compared on the basis

of their max~mum carbon sedimentation rates and

minimum 2 h flow velocities (Fig 6). The 1:1 molar
ratios between carbon deposition and _O2_ and _x C 0 2_
flux (Figs. 3 _**`8:`**_ 4 ) observed suggest that waste salmon
food and leces are readily degradable and that sedimentation rates are a good predictor of the ultimate
oxygen denland generated by the sediments. Minimum 2 h flow velocities were chosen as the key parameter to describe oxygen supply to the benthos because current velocities varied with tidal stage, and 2 h
exposures to reduced oxygen and elevated hydrogen
sulfide concentrations causes permanent damage to
the gill tissues of sensitive infauna (Theede et al. 1969)
The loss of macrofauna will shift apparent sediment
oxygen diffusion coefficients toward the molecular

constrains the maximal rate of oxygen delivery.

The circular net-pens located within Toothacher Cove
had minimum 2 h flow velocities of 0.0 cm _**S-'**_ and

moderate maximum carbon sedimentation rates. Their

level of impact, however, was quite high with _Beggia-_

Two sites, Eastport depositional and Eastport erosional, showed carbon deposition rates (in mm01 m-2
d-l) approximately equal to or less than the predicted
oxygen supply rate (Fig. 6). These sites showed minimal impacts compared to other Maine sites (Table 2)
and most sltes from around the world (e.g Hall et al.

# - Fickian O2 flux (mmol m-2 d-l)

as a function of flow velocity

1990, Holmer & Kristensen 1992, Hargrave et al. 1993).
The 2 net-pens located in Toothacher Cove showed
higher levels of impact than the Eastport s~tes even
though their carbon deposition rates were approximately one-half to two-thirds the rate measured at the
Eastport depositional site. We believe that the higher
level of impact is due to the fact that oxygen demand
exceeded supply. Oxygen supply at the Toothacher
Cove locations was constrained by no-flow conditions
not present at the Eastpoi-t sites.

**DISCUSSION**

Oxygen is delivered to sediments in shallow-water
marine environments by a variety of mechanismsmolecular diffusion, bioturbation, and flow and wave
advection. We have based our model on the delivery of

Fickian O2 flux (mmol m-2 **d-l)**

oxygen by molecular, or Fickian, diffusion alone. We

as a function of flow velocity

do so based upon the conditions encountered at many
salmonid production sites that experience the azoic
sedimentslBeggiatoa-mat endpoint. Most, if not all, of

the sites have minimum flow velocities of 13.0 cm _**S-'**_

(for many minimum flow is 0.0 cm S-'). At these velocities pressure gradients are insufficient to generate
advection (Huttel & Gust 1992, Huttel et al. 1996).
Wave advection, while possible in 10 to 15 m water
depth, is a ]lighly variable phenomenon in the sheltered coves and bays typical of net-pen aquaculture.
Bioturbation will decrease in importance as the macrofauna1 community experiences organic enrichment
(moving from 'reference' through 'peak of opportunists'
to 'azoic' sensu Pearson & Rosenberg 1978), and, by

increase diffusive flux by 49 "/;, . Studies in shallow or
intertidal sediments where apparent sediment diffusion coefficients for oxygen are compared to the molecular coefficients typically note apparcnt diffusion
coeffic~ents 2 to 3 tlmes hlgher than the molecular
coefficient (e.g. Andersen & Helder 1987. Hofman et al.
1991). But these studies were also typically conducted
using sediments with healthy macrofauna populations.
Deep sea sediments are constrained in a fashion similar to salmonid production sites that experience the
azoic sedimentlBeggiatoa-mat endpoint (low to no
flow, little bioturbation, low roughness); in these cases
comparisons of apparent and molecular diffusion coefficients were in good agreement (Reimers et al. 1984,
Reimers & Smith 1986).
For our model to be applicable to salmonid production sites around the world, the rates measured in this
study should be comparable to those at other sites or, if
they are not, then critical biogeochemical processes
should operate similarly over the range of rates
reported for all sites. Carbon deposition rates measured in this study were within the range reported in
the literature but maximum values were 6-fold lower

that the maximum value reported by Hall et al. (1990).
In spite of this difference in, benthic carbon flux, both
sediment 0, uptake and CC02 production rates measured in this study were comparable to those reported
for other salmonid production sites (Table 3). As previously noted, none of the sites used in this study showed
an accumulation of wastes beneath the net-pens, while
this is commonly observed at sites with higher carbon
flux rates (e.g. Hall et al. 1990, Hansen et al. 1991, Hargrave et al. 1993).
The observed correlation in the present study between O2 flux and sedimentation does not imply that
aerobic decomposition is directly responsible for degradation of organic matter at these sites. Aerobic
oxidation of organic carbon with a similar redox state
as carbohydrate (e.g CH20) will produce 1 mole of
CO2 for every mole of 0, consumed and a respiratory
quotient (moles CO2 produced/02 consumed) of 1.0.
Respiratory quotients varied between sites and within
sites depending on the rate of carbon flux to the benthos. For sediments, both proximal and distal, receiving organic carbon fluxes of 5150 mm01 m-' d-', the
respiratory quotient averaged 1.4 (Fig. 5a). These
values are within the range of respiratory quotients
reported for sediments with active benthic fauna from
around the world (Hargrave & Phillips 1981, Mackin
& Swider 1989, Krlstensen et al. 1991, Boucher et al.
1994). In marine sediments, respiratory quotients > l
have been interpreted to indicate active sulfate reduction with reduced sulfur retained at depth within the
sediments (as So or FeS,, often temporally, if considered on an annual basis). Under this Interpretation

aerobic respiration plays a direct role in decomposi.tion
of organic matter (Jsrgensen 1977, Ssrensen et al.
1979, Jorgensen & Ssrensen 1985). Recent work suggests that this may not be the case (e.g. Mackin &
Swider 1989, Ditoro et al. 1990) and that chemical
oxidation of reduced metabolic endproducts produced
by anaerobic decomposition of organic matter (frequently referred to as chemical oxygen demand) may
account for the majority (>go%) of benthic O2 fluxes.
Holmer & Kristensen (1992) and Hargrave et al. (1993)
reported conditions beneath net-pen facilities exhibiting the azoic sediments/Beggiatoa-mat endpoint
where chemical oxygen demand was sufficient to
account for benthic O2 flux rates. Oxidation of H2S,
produced during the anaerobic decomposition of
organic matter by sulfate-reducing bacteria, is thought
to be the major source of the chemical oxygen demand
in marine sediments.

Regardless of the pathway of organic matter decomposition, if the supply of oxygen is sufficient then
hydrogen sulfide will not accumulate within surface
sediments. This lack of accumulation may be the key to
maintaining an active macrofaunal community and
ultimately maintaining the assimilative capacity of the
benthos. Conversely, the azoic sediments/Beggiatoamat endpoint is an indication that H2S is present at
the sediment surface (Jsrgensen & Revsbech 1983). As
sulfide accumulates, a variety of metabolic processes
may become inhibited and carbon preservation within
the sediments enhanced (Hargrave et al. 1993). Measurements of CO2 production suggest that sediment
metabolism is constrained in sediment impacted by
wastes from salmonid production facilities. Maximum
rates reported were 387 mm01 m-' d-' (this study),
619 mm01 m-' d-' (Holmer & Kristensen 1992) and
553 mm01 m-2 d-' (Hall et al. 1990). These rates were

all measured in sediments from environments with

periods of zero flow but which differed by an order of
magnitude in their rates of carbon sedimentation. If
sulfate reduction rates are limited by the toxicity of H2S
to the anaerobic, fermentative bacteria that produce
the substrates utilized by sulfate-reducing bacteria,
then accumulation of organic matter under net-pen
facilities would also be governed by oxygen supply
and demand. Measurements of maximum CO2 production rates suggest that benthic accumulation of carbon
would occur at sites with periods of no flow at benthic
carbon flux rates of approximately 600 mm01 m-2 d-'
Most salmonid aquaculture sites around the world
report current ranges of 0 to 10 cm S-' This suggests
that these sites would experience significant periods of
time with little or no flow and that they would be constrained by oxygen supply as were the Toothacher
Cove sites. As such, a sedimentation rate in excess of
200 to 400 mm01 C m-, d-' (extrapolated rate at 0.0 cm

Findlay _R_ Watlinq Benth IC ~ m p a c t of salmon net-pens 155

S-' and the rate at 0.3 cm S-') is predicted as the threshold value at which the azoic sedimentslBeggiatoa-mat
endpoint would be observed. In 2 cases where sedi
mentation rates exceeded 400 mm01 C m-' d-' and no
flow conditions were reported (Hall et al. 1990, Hansen
et al. 1991), this endpoint was observed. Hargrave
(1995) reported sedimentation rates of 100 to 117 mm01
m-' d-l at the pen edge and 650 mm01 m-' d-l beneath
the pens at the L'Etang Inlet site (New Brunswick,
Canada). Impacts beneath the pens were consistent
with the azoic sediments/Beggiatoa-mat endpoint but
at the pen edge they were less severe (Hargrave et al.
1993). Ye et al. (1991) reported carbon sedimentation
rates in excess of 400 mm01 m-' d-' but only documented low to moderate benthic impacts at their site.
No-flow conditions were not reported and average
current velocities would have maintained oxygen supply in excess of oxygen demand as predicted from

sedimentation rates.

**Model** summary

We have developed our model of benthic impact
associated with net-pen aquarulture using 2 parameters: oxygen supply to the sediments and sediment
oxygen demand (both expressed as mm01 m-2 d-l). The
relationship between these 2 parameters can be examined in 2 ways, either graphically as in Fig 6 or by the
calculation of an index of impact (I) given as:

_I_ = _02supply_ _/02_ demand (2)

We calculate oxygen supply by assuming delivery by
Fickian diffusion, using Eq. (1) and **3** key environmental variables: (1) flow velocity as the determinate of diffusive boundary layer thickness, (2) temperature, and
(3) oxygen concentration of the bottom water. For 15'C

and saturated bottom water we estimate:

_0,_ _supply_ (mmol m-' d-l) = 736.3 + 672.5 log(v) (3)

where v is flow veloci.ty in cm S-' (Fig 2).
Sediment oxygen demand is predicted from measured carbon sedimentation rates. Linear regression
analysis of data from Maine production facilities
yielded the equation used to convert carbon sedimentation rates to sediment oxygen demand, that is:

_`0,`_ demand (mmol m-2 d ' ) = 1 . 0 7 ~ - 32.6 **(4)**

where _**`X`**_ is carbon flux to the benthos in mm01 m-2 d-l

(Fig. 3)
It is this balance between supplb. and demand that
produces the prediction of impact. If the supply of
oxygen is in excess of demand, then I - 1.0, and
impacts are minimal. If supply and demand are near
unity, then I = 1.0, and impacts are moderate. If de

mand is in excess of supply, then I < l .O, and the sediments exhibit the azoic sediment/Beggiatoa-mat endpoint. We suspect, but were unable to investigate
since Ma.ine does not have sites with accumulated

organic matter, that I will be much less than 1.0 at
sites where wastes form distinct deposits beneath the

pens.

Conclusions

Flow velocities have long been recognized as important in predicting benthic impact associated with netpen aquaculture, but only as a mechanism by which
waste feed and feces are distributed within the envi
ronment. Our study clearly demonstrates the pivotal
I-ole of flow in reducing the benthic impact of net-pens.
lncreased flow velocity not only reduces carbon sedimentation rates, but also results in increased sedlment
oxygen delivery, in turn allowing greater benthic degradation of the waste stream. We hypothesize that the
non-linear increase in oxygen delivery with increasing
flow was the major cause of the inability to predict
impacts across a variety of sites.
As _O2_ _supply_ is derived from an assumption that
impacted sediments are constrained to oxygen delivery by Fickian diffusion and that this rate is under the
control of a few key environmental variables, it is likely
that the calculation of _O-,_ _supply_ will be robust across
a variety of geographical or hydrological regions. This
may or may not be the case for _O2_ demand. The calculation of _0,_ demand is based on an empirical relationship developed for a series of sites from coastal Maine
and none of the sites used showed significant accumulation of organic wastes beneath the pens. Data from
Hansen et al. (1991) suggests that a different (-0.5:l)
molar oxygen demand may be needed for longestablished, facilities wlth visible waste accumulation.
Regardless, if an accurate a _prlon_ prediction of benthic
carbon flux can be made for proposed net-pen sites,
then this model will be a useful tool for predicting
levels of benthic impact. Studies of ZC02 flux rates
suggest that oxygen supply to the sediments and its
role in regulating sediment sulfide concentrations
might be useful in predicting carbon sedimentation
rates at \vh.ich accumulation of waste deposits would
occur This model may have general applicability to
other types of organic enrichment if correlative studies
linking carbon sedimentation rates to benthic O2 flux
rates can be performed (as was done in this study) or if
organir matter decay rate constants are known or can
be determined for the introduced organic material.
This model synthesizes the understanding that sediment oxygen delivery and sediment oxygen consumption both play a role in determining benthic commu

nity structure and, if these 2 parameters are measured
and comparcld, then the level of impact can be predicted for net-pen aquaculture. Key parameters become benthic carbon flux and oxygen delivery rates;
comparison of these rates reveal ivhether the available
carbon will be consumed aerobically with minimal
environmental impact or anaerobically ind.ucing environmental impact.
