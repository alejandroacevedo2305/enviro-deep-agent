Fork Lift Trucks

#### Made with heart in every detail
# SMARTER WHERE IT MATTERS

Konecranes has been manufacturing, selling and
supporting heavy-duty fork lift trucks for some 60
years. The first truck we ever made and delivered,
back in the 1950s, was a fork lift truck. Buy
one from us today and you will get the latest
technology, the lowest Total Cost of Ownership,
and a fork lift truck made with heart.

We claim the lowest Total Cost of Ownership with our
fork lift trucks, understood as an equation running
over a time period of years as shown below. When
you’re shopping around the suppliers and comparing
prices, our truck will probably not be the cheapest.
But it will provide the best value over time.

Close to you
We sell our lift trucks around the world in two

main ways: directly via our own sales and service
organizations in about ten countries, and indirectly
via distributors in more than 80 countries. In both

cases, our fork lift trucks are fully supported with
spare parts and personalized service. Konecranes
has the widest service reach of any company in the
lifting business. And our distributors are some of the
most respected in the business.

Service made easy
To reduce lifetime running and maintenance costs
we have extended the service interval of the engine
by 500 hours, the gearbox by 1000 hours and the
hydraulics by 4000 hours.

Our HLL ultra-fine filter system extends the hydraulic
oil change interval from 4000 up to 12000 hours. In
practice, you will use up to 80% less hydraulic oil than
with a conventional hydraulic system.

Genuine Konecranes parts are the best protection
for your investment. They pay off in truck
performance and uptime.

1 Powerful engines
Certified low-emission engines provide
extra high torque at low revs, reduced
fuel consumption and low noise levels.
We offer a variety of engines for EU

stage 2/3a/3b and EPA Tier 2/3/4i.

2 ErgoCab, probably the best cabin

on the market

Every detail has been carefully designed

for comfort and safety. Controls,

displays, ventilation and seating work

to boost driver productivity. Excellent

visibility in all directions.

3 Empower the truck for your operation

Select the right lifting mast from our

wide range. Choose between Duplex

(with or without free lift) and Triplex

(with free lift).

4 Smart load-sensing hydraulics

They sense the load and adapt the

lifting power to the weight of the load.

The truck provides maximum power only

when really needed, so it consumes less

fuel while reducing emissions and noise.

#### ErgoCab
# TRULY SPACIOUS, REMARKABLE VISIBILITY

Customized precisely as you need.

Step inside and you will find that ErgoCab is truly spacious:
there is plenty of room for the driver and any extra equipment
you might require. “Large” is the standard size. XL and XXL are
available as options.

You will also be struck by the remarkable visibility. The windows
are very large. There are no corner posts, and the roof crossmember is very strong but thin. We have done everything
possible to ensure clear sightlines to the key working areas,
both in the front, to the sides and to the rear.

You can customize ErgoCab precisely as you require for your
container handling operation. Select the joystick, joystick panel,
steering wheel, driver’s seat and instrumentation that you
need. The cabin can be raised from the standard position by
250 up to 700 mm if required.

1 Remarkable visibility

Visibility is very difficult to measure

objectively: you just know it when you

see it. Sit down in ErgoCab, see what

visibility from a lift truck cabin can be.

2 Intelligent Electronic Machine Control

Our EMC Master system gives the

driver real-time information on truck

performance including full monitoring

of the engine, transmission, hydraulics

and lifting controls.

3 Left armrest mini-steering options

Optional, ergonomic steering solutions

that improve productivity.

4 Ergonomic instrumentation

Whatever extra equipment you

need, we can install it as part of an

ergonomic instrumentation layout.

ErgoCab is truly spacious.

5 Comfort

An excellent seat with compressor

suspension, powerful cabin heating and

ventilation, air conditioning - the driver

is provided with every possible comfort.

6 Lifting controls

Available as standard, the lifting levers

offer super-smooth touch control at

every point of a handling operation.

Fork Lift Trucks

#### A world of options
# BOOSTING SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY

Konecranes invests significantly in fork lift truck
R&D to be the first to offer new technologies
that improve performance and safety. We also
ensure that our fork lifts are fully compliant
with current emissions regulations, anticipating
their evolution as a normal part of our product
development process.

Emissions-compliant diesel engines
We offer a wide range of powerful Volvo, Scania
and Cummins engines certified according to EU
stage 2/3a/3b and US EPA Tier 2/3/4i. For EU
stage 2/3a and US EPA Tier 2/3 compliance we
can offer additional two-way catalyzers or particle
filters (including a catalyzer) to reduce exhaust
emissions.

EMC Master

Our Intelligent Electronic Machine Control
system, EMC Master, provides the following
functions as standard:

- Full truck monitoring

- ECO-Drive and fuel management

- Productivity counter management

- Driver log-in (20 drivers)

The following functions are optional:

- Electronic weight scale

- Mini-wheel steering

- Mini-lever steering

- Auto engine shut-down

- Auto parking brake

- Auto tilt-to-zero of lift mast

- Drive speed limitation (unloaded/loaded)

- Data logging of alarms and errors

- Remote Access Service (via GSM)

NearGuard warning system
The award-winning NearGuard warning system
is based on Radio Frequency Identification
Detection (RFID) technology. The system consists
of 2-4 receivers mounted on the lift truck

and RFID tags attached to obstacles and/or
employees working in the lift truck’s operating
area. When the lift truck is driven in close

proximity to a tagged obstacle or employee, the
driver sees a flashing warning indicator on the
EMC control system’s color display. NearGuard
brings a powerful new dimension to lift truck
safety and infrastructure protection.

Tire pressure monitor
Under-inflated tires can increase fuel consumption
by as much as 15% while impairing stability and
drivability. Our tire pressure monitor makes it
easy to keep your lift truck tires properly inflated.
It’s installed in minutes. If you combine it with
the drive speed limitation provided by EMC
Master you can extend the life of your tires
even further.

Fire alarm and suppression system
We offer an effective fire alarm and suppression
system that can be activated either manually
or automatically. When the lift truck is in use, the
system discharges in three ways: manually from
inside the cabin; manually from outside via a
mudguard trigger; automatically by sensors in the
engine compartment. When the fork lift is not in
use, i.e. when the master power switch is turned
off, the system discharges automatically when
the fire alarm goes off.

Other safety options

- Parking Distance Control (PDC): with sensors for
driving in reverse

- Breath Analyzer: an alcohol test unit which
requires the driver to take a breath test before
starting the lift truck

- Camera Supervision System: can be mounted
as a reversing camera on the rear of the lift
truck, or as a forward camera mounted on for
example the mast
