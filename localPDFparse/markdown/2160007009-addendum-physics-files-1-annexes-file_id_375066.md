Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant (HTP) in Los
Angeles started a collaboration to determine the efficacy of biological waste air treatment techniques for
H 2 S and VOC removal. This project involved practical
on-site research with pilot-scale biofilters and biotrickling filters at the headworks of HTP to directly compare
and evaluate their performance [1-3]. As part of this
project, a literature survey was conducted to evaluate
the simultaneous removal of odor and VOCs by biological technologies at POTWs and other facilities with
similar composition of waste air. The findings are reported herein. Subsequently, HTP and other POTWs in
Southern California have started wider implementation
of biological techniques for the control of their odorous
exhausts.
The principles of biological waste air treatment and
the advantages over chemical and physical techniques
have been extensively reviewed [4-12]. Biological
waste air treatment is an established technology, although still in development with research on, for instance, the use of new media and designs [13-15],
microbial structure analysis [16], and modeling of H 2 S
and VOC removal [17-19]. The literature also provides
many laboratory studies on pollutant removal in biofilters and biotrickling filters (Tables 1 and 2). Nearly all
of these studies address the removal of single pollutants under constant operating conditions. Such conditions are highly unusual at POTWs and other facilities.
For instance, the headworks ventilation air at HTP and
most other POTWs is a complex mixture of H 2 S and
other reduced sulfur compounds (such as carbon disulfide, dimethyl sulfide, and methyl mercaptan), aromatic hydrocarbons (such as toluene, benzene, and
xylenes), chlorinated hydrocarbons [such as methylene
chloride, chloroform, trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)], and possibly nitrogen compounds. The actual composition and individual concentrations often varies subtsantially over time. At HTP,
H 2 S is the major component with concentrations in
general between 5 and 50 parts per million (ppm),
depending on the time of day. Other pollutants are
present at lower concentrations, typically between 0
and 150 parts per billion (ppb). Apart from fluctuations
in the waste air composition, the performance of fullscale biofilters and biotrickling filters in the field may
be affected by unsteady conditions (such as temperature and relative humidity) and discontinuous pollutant
supply, system maintenance, or breakdowns [20].
A large number of biofilters have been installed
throughout the world. In the United States alone, the
number of biofilters installed at POTWs by seven major
vendors is estimated to exceed 300. However, performance data are often published in sources difficult to
access or not published at all, which makes an overall
assessment of the technology difficult. In addition,
biotrickling filtration is a relatively new technique, and
experiences with biotrickling filters have mainly been
at the pilot-scale.
In this paper we present an overview of field experiences with biofilters and biotrickling filters. The main
focus is on biological treatment of VOC-containing
odorous waste air at POTWs in the United States, but
other facilities with similar composition waste air have

been included as well. Reactor design and pollutant
removal efficiencies are summarized in tables for easy
reference, for a perspective on the current state of the
literature, and to allow a direct comparison between
different projects. Readers are encouraged to consult
the original references for additional details.

APPROACH AND DEFINITIONS
The following sources were used for this survey:
scientific journals, conference proceedings, progress
reports, and review articles discussing case studies. The
latter included documents provided by vendors supplying biofilters and biotrickling filters. This survey
covers the developments from about 1990 up to 2004.
The results are grouped in tables as follows:

 - Tables 1 and 2: Examples of laboratory research with
biofilters and biotrickling filters, respectively, treating odorous compounds and VOCs that are often
found in waste air from wastewater treatment.

 - Tables 3 and 4: Projects with on-site foul air treatment in biofilters with a general description of biofilter design (Table 3) and a summary of pollutant
removal efficiencies (Table 4).

 - Tables 5 and 6: Projects with on-site foul air treatment in biotrickling filters with a general description
of biotrickling filter design (Table 5) and a summary
of pollutant removal efficiencies (Table 6).
Although Tables 3 to 6 primarily contain examples
with pilot-/full-scale reactors, bench-scale experiments
were also included. The only criterion for selection into
Tables 3 to 6 was that the reference should deal with
field experiments or full-scale applications treating
waste air from existing operations at wastewater treatment or other facilities.
Table entries include reactor design and operation
and performance parameters. Design and operation of
biofilters are described by the composition of the waste
air and the observed range of concentrations of individual pollutants, the reactor dimensions, the type of
packing, the empty bed gas residence time (EBRT), and
pretreatment of the waste air. For biotrickling filters,
data concerning liquid trickling and/or recirculation
and pH control are also provided.
The performance is described by the removal efficiency (RE) and/or the elimination capacity (EC) at the
specified EBRT. These three parameters are defined as
follows:

constant, but fluctuate within certain ranges (either
intentionally in laboratory studies, or by nature of field
operation). Consequently, large fluctuations in the RE

parameter ranges, rather than average values.

Laboratory studies have demonstrated the biodegradation of a wide range of pollutants in biofilters and
biotrickling filters. Selected examples are presented in
Tables 1 and 2. These tables illustrate that most pollutants present in POTW waste air can be removed in
biofilters and biotrickling filters. Efficient removal--as

single pollutants in synthetic waste air streams--has
been demonstrated for odorous sulfur and amino-nitrogen compounds, (oxygenated) aliphatics, aromatics,
and chlorinated compounds. The removal of poorly
biodegradable compounds (such as chlorobenzenes,
MTBE), compounds that require cometabolism (TCE),
or anaerobic conditions (PCE) has also been observed.
The elimination capacity of the VOC undergoing
treatment depends on many factors related to the design and operation of the bioreactor, as well as the
properties of the pollutant. In particular, the water
solubility and pollutant Henry coefficient are important

[45]. For easily biodegradable and hydrophilic VOCs,
ECs of up to nearly 150 gm [] [3] h [] [1] can be obtained.
Hydrophobic VOCs such as alkanes are usually removed slower because of mass transfer limitations [46].
In addition, the EC can also be limited by the biological
reaction rate, that is, in the case of poorly biodegradable and/or toxic pollutants. Interestingly, some poorly
biodegradable VOCs such as MTBE require a long
start-up phase (months rather than days) before signif

icant removal is observed, but once the reactor reaches
steady state, the EC is comparable to that of more easily
biodegradable pollutants [36].
Depending on the inlet concentration and EBRT,
removal efficiencies of individual compounds in biofilters and biotrickling filters can be near 100%. By comparing Tables 1 and 2, one can observe that biotrickling
filters are in general operated at a shorter EBRT and at
relatively high inlet concentrations. The maximum EC
reported from laboratory studies was the highest in
biotrickling filters, possibly as a result of better control
of reaction conditions and higher biomass content,
although it should be noted that the maximum EC is in
general observed at relatively high pollutant concentrations when the removal efficiency is  100%. Nearcomplete pollutant removal is usually observed only at
lower inlet concentrations and longer EBRTs. Finally,
comparison of the studies in Tables 1 and 2 is very
difficult because many of the systems were not tested
to failure. Thus, maximum loading rates were not determined because removal may have been impacted by

Environmental Progress (Vol.24, No.3) October 2005 257

reactor configuration or operation and because the
rates of removal are highly pollutant/substrate dependent.

**Field Experiences with Biofilters**
Table 3 presents an overview of projects and fullscale applications of biofilters. Most of those listed in
Table 3 have been installed at POTWs, with waste air
containing odorous sulfur compounds as major components. Some are at livestock and composting facilities, which emit relatively high concentrations of odorous nitrogen compounds.
A great variety of packing materials have been used
in biofilters, such as peat, compost (from various
sources), bark, and wood chips. Packing materials are
selected to provide high specific surface area, high
porosity, and compressive strength. Many materials
provide satisfactory support for bacterial growth and
this consideration is generally not a problem. “Natural”
packings such as compost, peat, and soil have been
widely used. Compost provides a rich community of
microorganisms as well as some mineral nutrients.
Both compost and peat decompose with time, causing
deterioration of the bed structure and increases in head
loss. Adding a bulking agent such as vermiculite, perlite, or woodchips considerably extends the life of
natural packings. To keep the pressure drop across the


biofilter to a certain maximum ( 10 cm water column),
the vast majority of biofilters contain a packed bed with
a height typically less than 1.2 m. Because of this
restriction, biofilters in general require a larger footprint than that of biotrickling filters. Still, it has been
reported that some biofilters operated at EBRTs longer
than 1 min were constructed with bed height as high as
2.4 m, without significant bed compaction or pressure
drop problems.
Moisture content of the packing has been identified
as the most critical parameter to control in biofilters

[68]. Indeed, many references listed in Table 3 mention
system upsets causing excessive drying of the packed
bed and declining performance. Although the relative
humidity of the air undergoing treatment is often  80%
at POTWs, the waste air is frequently humidified in
packed towers before entering the biofilter. Most applications also have a sprinkling system for direct additional water supply onto the packed bed. Prehumidification in spray towers also removes particulate matter
from the waste air, thus preventing clogging of the
packed bed. An alternative would be the use of cyclones, electrostatic precipitation separators, or venture
scrubbers, although these are expensive. Waste air
from composting facilities frequently has temperatures
greater than the optimum of most microorganisms (1535° C). In those cases, cooling may be achieved by
evaporative cooling after addition of dilution air or by
using heat exchangers. Both options substantially increase the overall treatment costs.
Performance data of biofilters at industrial applications are summarized in Table 4. Concentrations of
individual pollutants are in general much lower than
those of substances used in the laboratory studies (Table 1), especially those of the VOCs. For this reason and
the fact that gas flow rate values are much more vari

able, only removal efficiencies are presented. Calculated elimination capacities for individual pollutants
would be small fractions of what is attainable in the
laboratory. Biofilters at industrial applications are operated at EBRTs from 20 to 200 s, which is comparable
to that of laboratory studies. Removal of H 2 S, the major
component in most odorous, industrial waste air, is in
general between 90 and 100%, indicating that significant odor reduction can be obtained by treatment in
biofilters. The few studies that include odor panel analysis confirm this: the observed odor reduction is often
 80%. Removal of odorous compounds other than H 2 S
(such as DMS, DMDS, and MM) is often lower, with
reported removal efficiencies ranging from about 20 to
100%. A few studies have also focused on the removal
of VOCs (see, for example, Deshusses _et al._ [1], Ergas _et_
_al._ [49], Webster _et al._ [55], and Wolstenholme & Finger

[57]). These seem to indicate that biofilters for H 2 S and
odor treatment are also capable of removing a broad
range of VOCs. However, VOC removal efficiencies are
generally  90% (sometimes as low as 20%, although
usually with a wide range of variation), even for easily
biodegradable VOCs such as acetone and toluene.

**Field Experiences with Biotrickling Filters**
As a relatively new technique, field experience with
biotrickling filters has been principally through feasibility studies with pilot-plant installations (Table 5).
Various types of packing materials have been used:
random dump plastic packing, lava rock, structured
packing, and open-pore polyurethane foam. The high
porosity of these packings causes less headloss compared to that of biofilters with organic packings, even
though biotrickling filters are operated at a higher gas
velocity. A distinctive feature of biotrickling filters is the
continuous trickling of liquid over the packing, which
allows for improved control of nutrient addition, pH,
acid product neutralization, end product removal, and
(potentially) temperature. In the case of odorous waste
air containing reduced sulfur compounds, production
of sulfuric acid with declining pH and/or accumulation
of sodium sulfate (after neutralization with caustic
soda) is an important design parameter. However, most
references cited in Table 5 provided limited information on parameters related to liquid recirculation, pH
control, nutrient supply, and water demand.
Performance data for biotrickling filters (Table 6)
indicate that these reactors are capable of efficient
removal of high concentrations of H 2 S at relatively low
EBRTs. Thus, biotrickling filters appear to be a good
option when the gas to be treated contains high concentrations of H 2 S and possibly other reduced sulfur
compounds. Relatively few data are available on the
removal of DMS, DMDS, and MM or the overall odor
reduction by biotrickling filters, and only a few studies
have addressed the removal of VOCs. The studies that
included VOCs indicate that, although H 2 S removal
may be faster in biotrickling filters, the VOC removal is
in general lower than that in biofilters.

be found at POTWs and other facilities. Comparing the
two systems, biotrickling filters appear to perform better when the waste air contains high H 2 S concentrations, when the objective is to remove H 2 S at the
highest volumetric elimination rate, or when extremely
short residence times are considered. For example, a
recent study has demonstrated that biotrickling filters
can effectively remove H 2 S at an EBRT as low as 1.6 s,
which is the normal gas contact time in chemical scrubbers at POTWs [78]. Biofilters tend to be used for
applications with lower H 2 S loadings because of the
concerns of inhibition of H 2 S removal and packing
deterioration by sulfuric acid production over the long
term. However, there are examples of successful biofilters operated at low pH and high H 2 S concentrations
in Tables 1 and 4.
Caution is needed in interpreting the results in the
tables because the varying methodologies used in the
respective studies raise difficulties for making comparisons and many questions raised by careful examination of the data cannot be answered from just reading
the cited references. Likewise, comparing the biofilter
results in Tables 3 and 4 with each other and with the
biotrickling filter results in Tables 5 and 6 is hampered
by the large variety of materials used as packings in
biofiltration and biotrickling filtration studies. This survey must thus be considered preliminary because of
the lack of data from comparable systems. However,
the potential of biofilters and biotrickling filters for the
combined removal of H 2 S/odor and VOCs is evident.
Simultaneous removal of VOCs, including aliphatics,
aromatics, and chlorinated compounds, has frequently

been observed, and therefore one can reasonably affirm that biofilters and biotrickling filters are a positive
development toward the control of air toxic releases
from POTWs. Although only a few studies have investigated the cotreatment of VOCs and H 2 S, they seem to
indicate that biofilters can achieve VOC removal efficiencies higher than those of biotrickling filters. This
can be plausibly explained by considering the low
solubility of most VOCs in water. The water layer in a
biotrickling filter would be expected to act as a barrier
separating these gases from the degrading microorganisms. Hydrophilic VOCs, such as ethanol and acetone,
may be more suited to treatment in biotrickling filters
than in biofilters. Further work will be needed to determine mass-transfer limitations of VOCs at low concentrations in biotrickling filters and whether any other
mechanism also contributes to the observed behavior.
Making all allowances for these uncertainties, the
literature strongly indicates that for both biofilters and
biotrickling filters, VOC removal is the limiting process
when treating complex odorous waste air containing
both H 2 S and VOCs. The design and operation of such
bioreactors should therefore aim at maximizing VOC
removal. One can reasonably speculate that, in most
cases, this may result in improved odor removal, although further proof in the field is required. In both
biofilters and biotrickling filters, VOC removal is not
complete, although the VOC load and elimination capacity in field applications is orders of magnitude
smaller than the maximum elimination capacity observed in the laboratory. Inhibition of VOC removal by
the presence of H 2 S is unlikely. Laboratory studies

showed that toluene [79] and MTBE [1] removal in
single-stage biotrickling filters for cotreatment of H 2 S
and the VOC were not affected by H 2 S in concentrations up to at least 150 ppm. Likewise, Sologar _et al._ [18]
did not observe significant interaction effects between
H 2 S and methanol during cotreatment in a biotrickling
filter. H 2 SO 4 production from sulfide oxidation and
decreasing pH potentially interfere with VOC biodeg

radation, given that most VOC degrading microorganisms prefer a neutral pH, although VOC removal at low
pH in bioreactors treating VOC/H 2 S mixtures has been
observed [78-81]. Low pH might indeed have been the
cause of poor VOC removal in some of the applications
described in Tables 3 to 6, especially in biofilters where
controlling the pH is more difficult to achieve than in
biotrickling filters. On the other hand, VOC removal in

Environmental Progress (Vol.24, No.3) October 2005 263

field biotrickling filters operated at a neutral pH was
lower than expected (for example, see Deshusses _et al._

[1] and Torres _et al._ [72]). This indicates that factors
other than the presence of H 2 S or low pH could be
involved. One factor of particular importance could be
the relatively low concentration of the VOCs. Whereas
a greater than 99% removal rate of 50-2000 ppm VOC
can easily be achieved in the laboratory (Tables 1 and
2), as well as in full-scale systems in VOC remediation
(Tables 4 and 6), resulting outlet concentrations are still
5-20 times higher than the concentrations present in
the waste air of POTWs. Removal of such low concentrations (10-1000 ppb v ) has received scant attention in
biological waste air treatment research, and it poses
additional challenges to effective treatment. One point
of concern is that VOC concentrations are too low to
sustain an active, heterotrophic population degrading
the VOCs [82]. This may be of particular importance in
biotrickling filters, in that the packing, contrary to compost, does not initially contain a native population of
microorganisms and alternative substrates that can be
used to sustain heterotrophic organisms.
Waste air from liquid processes at POTWs typically
contains relatively high concentrations of H 2 S, whereas
waste air from solids-handling processes can be highly
odorous and have a more complex composition [8385]. We believe that there are many opportunities for
using biofilters and biotrickling filters as a replacement
of the chemical scrubbers that are currently used for
these waste air streams at many POTWs.

CONCLUSIONS
This survey confirms the feasibility of biofilters and
biotrickling filters as effective H 2 S and odor-treatment
technologies for waste air from POTWs. Biological
treatment also holds promise for removing VOCs,
thereby potentially reducing the overall toxicity and
carcinogenicity of the waste air. This may be significant
to POTWs because they could receive credit toward

overall removal of cumulative VOCs by regulatory
agencies. However, VOC removal in field applications
is lower than what has been achieved in the laboratory.
This indicates that for effective treatment of complex
odorous air streams the design and operation should
emphasize VOC removal as the rate-limiting parameter.
