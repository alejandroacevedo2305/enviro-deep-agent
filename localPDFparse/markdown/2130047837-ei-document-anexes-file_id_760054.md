**Applications**
Amasil NA is a partly buffered formic acid.
Therefore, the product is only irritant, easier to
handle and with a reduced odour compared
to pure formic acid.

Based on the very high content of formic acid
and sodium formate, Amasil NA is an excellent
preservative to inhibit bacteria and yeasts in
feed­stuffs. Thus Amasil NA is recommended
to improve feed hygiene by reducing micro­
organisms like Salmonella, E. coli or Cam­
pylobacter in pig and poultry feed and single
feed components (Dosage 6-12 kg/t feed).
Amasil NA can also be used as feed acidifer i
(Dosage 6-12 kg/t feed).

A special application field is silage treatment.
Amasil NA reduces pH and improves silage
fermentation under wet and difficult conditions
(low dry matter, high protein content of grass
silages). Recommended dosage for silage
treatment is 3.0-4.5 l/t silage.

Recommended materials for storage are up to
60°C austenitic chromium/nickel and chromium ­/
nickel/molybdenum steels materials Nos.:
1.4541 and 1.4571.
