PROCEDURES IF MATERIAL IS RELEASED OR SPILLED:

LAND SPILL: Shut off source taking normal safety precautions. Take
measures to minimize the effects on ground water. Recover by
pumping or contain spilled material with sand or other suitable
absorbent and remove mechanically into containers. If necessary,
dispose of adsorbed residues as directed in Section 13.
WATER SPILL: Confine the spill immediately with booms. Warn other
ships in the vicinity. Notify port and other relevant authorities.

Remove from the surface by skimming or with suitable absorbents. If
permitted by regulatory authorities the use of suitable dispersants
should be considered where recommended in local oil spill
procedures.
ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS: Prevent material from entering sewers, water
sources or low lying areas; advise the relevant authorities if it
has, or if it contaminates soil/vegetation.
PERSONAL PRECAUTIONS: See Section 8

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
HANDLING: High pressure injection under the skin may occur due to the
rupture of pressurized lines. Always seek medical attention. No
special precautions are necessary beyond normal good hygiene
practices. See Section 8 for additional personal protection advice
when handling this product.
STORAGE: Keep containers closed when not in use. Do not store in open or
unlabelled containers. Store away from strong oxidizing agents and
combustible materials. Do not store near heat, sparks, flame or
strong oxidants.
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS: Prevent small spills and leakages to avoid slip

hazard.

EMPTY CONTAINER WARNING: Empty containers retain residue (liquid and/or
vapor) and can be dangerous. DO NOT PRESSURIZE, CUT, WELD, BRAZE,
SOLDER, DRILL, GRIND OR EXPOSE SUCH CONTAINERS TO HEAT, FLAME,

SPARKS, STATIC ELECTRICITY, OR OTHER SOURCES OF IGNITION; THEY MAY
EXPLODE AND CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH. Do not attempt to refill or clean
container since residue is difficult to remove. Empty drums should
be completely drained, properly bunged and promptly returned to a
drum reconditioner. All containers should be disposed of in an
environmentally safe manner and in accordance with governmental
regulations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE LIMITS:

When mists/aerosols can occur, the following are recommended: 5 mg/m3
(as oil mist)- ACGIH Threshold Limit Value (TLV), 10 mg/m3 (as oil mist)

- ACGIH Short Term Exposure Limit (STEL), 5 mg/m3 (as oil mist) - OSHA
Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL)

VENTILATION: If mists are generated, use adequate ventilation, local
exhaust or enclosures to control below exposure limits.
RESPIRATORY PROTECTION: If mists are generated, and/or when ventilation
is not adequate, wear approved respirator.
EYE PROTECTION: If eye contact is likely, safety glasses with side
shields or chemical type goggles should be worn.
SKIN PROTECTION: Not normally required. When splashing or liquid contact
can occur frequently, wear oil resistant gloves and/or other

11. TOXICOLOGICAL DATA

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
---ACUTE TOXICOLOGY--
ORAL TOXICITY (RATS): Practically non-toxic (LD50: greater than 2000
mg/kg). ---Based on testing of similar products and/or the
components.
DERMAL TOXICITY (RABBITS): Practically non-toxic (LD50: greater than

2000 mg/kg). ---Based on testing of similar products and/or the
components.
INHALATION TOXICITY (RATS): Practically non-toxic (LC50: greater than 5
mg/l). ---Based on testing of similar products and/or the
components.
EYE IRRITATION (RABBITS): Practically non-irritating. (Draize score:
greater than 6 but 15 or less). ---Based on testing of similar
products and/or the components.
SKIN IRRITATION (RABBITS): Practically non-irritating. (Primary
Irritation Index: greater than 0.5 but less than 3). ---Based on
testing of similar products and/or the components.
OTHER ACUTE TOXICITY DATA: Although an acute inhalation study was not
performed with this product, a variety of mineral and synthetic
oils, such as those in this product, have been tested. These
samples had virtually no effect other than a nonspecific
inflammatory response in the lung to the aerosolized mineral oil.
The presence of additives in other tested formulations (in
approximately the same amounts as in the present formulation) did

not alter the observed effects.

---SUBCHRONIC TOXICOLOGY (SUMMARY)--No significant adverse effects were found in studies using repeated
dermal applications of similar formulations to the skin of
laboratory animals for 13 weeks at doses significantly higher than
those expected during normal industrial exposure. The animals were
evaluated extensively for effects of exposure (hematology, serum
chemistry, urinalysis, organ weights, microscopic examination of
tissues etc.).

---REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY (SUMMARY)--No teratogenic effects would be expected from dermal exposure, based on
laboratory developmental toxicity studies of major components in
this formulation and/or materials of similar composition.

---CHRONIC TOXICOLOGY (SUMMARY)--Repeated and/or prolonged exposure may cause irritation to the skin, eyes
or respiratory tract. Overexposure to oil mist may result in oil
droplet deposition and/or granuloma formation. For mineral base
oils: Base oils in this product are severely solvent refined and/or
severely hydrotreated. Chronic mouse skin painting studies of
severely treated oils showed no evidence of carcinogenic effects.
These results are confirmed on a continuing basis using various
screening methods such as Modified Ames Test, IP-346, and/or other
analytical methods. For synthetic base oils: The base oils in this
product have been tested in the Ames assay and other tests of
mutagenicity with negative results. These base oils are not
expected to be carcinogenic with chronic dermal exposures.

---SENSITIZATION (SUMMARY)--Not expected to be sensitizing based on tests of this product,
components, or similar products.

12. ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENVIRONMENTAL FATE AND EFFECTS:

In the absence of specific environmental data for this product, this
assessment is based on information for representative products.
When released into the environment, adsorption to sediment and soil
will be the predominant behavior. Available ecotoxicity data (LL50
>1000 mg/L) indicates that adverse effects to aquatic organisms are
not expected from this product. Bioaccumulation is unlikely due to
the very low water solubility of this product, therefore
bioavailability to aquatic organisms is minimal. This product is
expected to be inherently biodegradable.
