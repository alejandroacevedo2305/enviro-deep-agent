# ROCK VALVETM STATIONARY CONCRETE PUMPS

SP 500 / SP 750-15 / SP 750-18 / SP 1000

SP 1000HP / SP 1250 / SP 2000

# THE CONCRETE, SHOTCRETE OR GROUT PUMP

- Output from 35 to 118 cubic yards per hour

- Pressure from 870 psi to 1568 psi

- Maximum Aggregate Size from .5" to 2.5"

_This open loop, all-hydraulic concrete pump sets the standard for fuel-efficiency,_
_reliability and performance. Twin circuit hydraulics combine with standard dual_
_shifting cylinders, agitator and Rock ValveTM to provide smooth pumping of harsh_
_mixes, shotcrete and grout._

_Convenient control panel includes electric_
_switches for on/off, forward/reverse and_
_agitator on/off. Tachometer and hour meter_
_are also located here along with E-stop,_
_fuse panel and ignition switch._

Invest in an all-hydraulic concrete pump that incorporates big pump features

into a compact, economical package. The SP Series pumps are excellent entry

level, all-around performers as well as seasoned professional machines pumping

grout, shotcrete and structural concrete with output up to 118 yards per hour

and pumping pressure up to 1568 psi. At the heart of these concrete pumps

is the Rock ValveTM which is used on all of the Schwing boom pumps. With the

lowest cost per yard of operating costs, the Rock ValveTM is your guarantee of

profitable pumping of the harshest mixes. This is the only sequencing valve that

is completely rebuildable adding to long term reliability and maximum utilization.

One call to Schwing puts you in touch with pumping expertise and a full range of

accessories so you are ready for new pumping challenges and profits. Because

your SP model is patterned on larger Schwing models, you are guaranteed

legendary reliability that has been proven on thousands of projects. Whether

your pump is your livelihood or part of a larger equipment fleet, purchase with

the confidence that only a Schwing can provide.

_Remote control (cable or optional radio_
_remote) frees the operator to monitor the_
_end hose and the pump. Critical functions_
_including on/off and forward/reverse are_
_at your fingertips._

_Fuel efficient CAT_ _®_ _diesel engines are an_
_example of the high quality components on our_
_stationary pumps. This engine was designed_
_for construction applications and is up to the_
_reliability standards of a Schwing pump._

_The Rock ValveTM cleans out faster, pumps_

_harsher mixes and wastes less concrete_

_than other pumps. The standard hopper_
_agitator keeps harsher mixes flowing to the_
_Rock ValveTM for trouble-free pumping._
