People’s expectation toward individual mobility requires more than just a convenient means of transportation. The old understanding of cars has become

outdated. A car represents individuals’ lifestyles, and it became an integral part of their lives. At the same time, the automobile industry has experienced

seismic change. Hyundai Motor Company has grown rapidly to become one of the largest automakers, backed by world class production capability and

superior quality. We have now reached a point where we need a qualitative approach to bring bigger ideas and relevant solutions to our customers.

This is an opportunity to move forward and we have developed a new brand slogan that encapsulates our willingness to take a big leap. Led by our new

slogan and the new thinking underlying it, we will become a company that keeps challenging itself to unlock new possibilities for people and the planet.
