## Fire-fighting measures

**Flammability of the product** **:**

**Extinguishing media**

Combustible liquid. In a fire or if heated, a pressure increase will occur and the
container may burst, with the risk of a subsequent explosion. The vapor/gas is heavier
than air and will spread along the ground. Vapors may accumulate in low or confined
areas or travel a considerable distance to a source of ignition and flash back.

**Suitable** **:** Use dry chemical, CO 2, water spray (fog) or foam.

**Not suitable** **:** Do not use water jet.

**Special exposure hazards** **:**

Promptly isolate the scene by removing all persons from the vicinity of the incident if
there is a fire. No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without suitable
training. Move containers from fire area if this can be done without risk. Use water
spray to keep fire-exposed containers cool.

**Hazardous thermal**
**decomposition products**

**Special protective**
**equipment for fire-fighters**

**:** carbon dioxide,carbon monoxide,sulfur oxides

**:** Fire-fighters should wear appropriate protective equipment and self-contained breathing
apparatus (SCBA) with a full face-piece operated in positive pressure mode.

## Accidental release measures

**Personal precautions** **:**

No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without suitable training.
Evacuate surrounding areas. Keep unnecessary and unprotected personnel from
entering. Do not touch or walk through spilled material. Shut off all ignition sources. No
flares, smoking or flames in hazard area. Do not breathe vapor or mist. Provide
adequate ventilation. Wear appropriate respirator when ventilation is inadequate. Put
on appropriate personal protective equipment (see Section 8).

**Environmental precautions**

**Methods for cleaning up**

**:** Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains
and sewers.

**Small spill** **:**

**Large spill** **:**

Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Absorb with an inert material.
Use spark-proof tools and explosion-proof equipment. Dispose of via a licensed waste
disposal contractor.

Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Approach release from
upwind. Dike spill area and do not allow product to reach sewage system or surface or
ground water. Notify any reportable spill to authorities. (See section 12 for environmental
risks and 13 for disposal information.) Contain and collect spillage with noncombustible, absorbent material e.g. sand, earth, vermiculite or diatomaceous earth and
place in container for disposal according to local regulations (see section 13). Use
spark-proof tools and explosion-proof equipment. Dispose of via a licensed waste
disposal contractor. Contaminated absorbent material may pose the same hazard as
the spilled product. Note: see section 1 for emergency contact information and section
13 for waste disposal.

**If RQ (Reportable Quantity) is exceeded, report to National Spill Response Office at 1-800-424-8802.**

**Chronic toxicity Remarks**

1) Light aromatic naphtha

Solvent naphtha (petroleum), light aromatic is a component of this product. Solvent naphtha (petroleum), light aromatic
may cause damage to the peripheral nerves, resulting in numbness or tingling of the extremities with chronic (long term)
exposure to high concentrations. (Micromedex) Rats exposed for 4 months to 1700 ppm of a solvent similar to this product
showed evidence of mild damage to the liver, lungs and kidneys. These effects were not seen in rats exposed for one year
to 350 ppm of another similar solvent. Rats exposed to vapors of a similar solvent during pregnancy showed
embryo/fetotoxicity at concentrations producing maternal toxicity.

In response to a TSCA test rule, several studies of a solvent similar to this product were completed. Mutagenicity studies
and a rat inhalation neurotoxicity study were negative. In a mouse developmental effects study, reduced fetal body weight
was seen but no teratogenicity. A rat reproductive effects study demonstrated toxicity but little effect on reproductive
parameters. (Vendor MSDS)

Ingestion has produced Central Nervous System effects in laboratory animals. (EPA/OTS 87-8214199 and 88-920000348)

2) 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene

1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene, also know as pseudocumene, is a component of this product. Chronic pseudocumene exposure
may provoke bronchospasm with cough and wheezing (Plunkett, 1976; ACGIH, 1991; Battig et al, 1956). Respiratory
distress was noted in experimental animals following sub acute inhalation exposure (Gage, 1970). Nervousness and

**6/29/2012.** T3032 _**6/11**_

anxiety were noted with chronic occupational exposure (Battig et al, 1956; ACGIH, 1991).

At the time of this review, no studies were found on the potential adverse reproductive effects of pseudocumene in
humans, but trimethylbenzenes (including pseudocumene) can cross the placental barrier (Clayton & Clayton, 1994; Doroty
et al, 1976). In an experimental animal study, offspring born to pregnant rats exposed to pseudocumene were healthy at
birth and grew normally (Cameron et al, 1938).

Blood effects such as anemia and delayed clotting time have been noticed in workers chronically exposed to a solvent
containing trimethylbenzene. The blood effects, however, may have been due to a contaminant in the solvent such as
benzene (a known blood toxin).

3) 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene

1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene (Mysitylene) is a component of this product. Chronic asthmatic-like bronchitis may be a delayed
chronic hazard (EPA, 1985; Laham, 1987; HSDB, 1997). Nervousness, tension, and anxiety have been noted in chronically
exposed workers with exposure to a mixture of solvents including mesitylene (HSDB, 1997). Elevated alkaline phosphates
and SGOT(liver enzymes) levels have been noted in chronic animal inhalation studies (Clayton & Clayton, 1994). These
effects have not been reported in exposed humans. (Reprotext)

Thrombocytopenia (a lack of platelets in the blood) with bleeding from the gums and nose and mild anemia may occur with
chronic exposure to mesitylene as a component of the commercial solvent mixture, "Fleet-X-DV-99" (Plunkett, 1976;
Finkel, 1983; HSDB, 1997). Coagulation (clotting of the blood) times were delayed by about 40% in a group of workers
chronically exposed to a mixture of solvents containing about 30% mesitylene (Laham, 1987). These hematological
disorders may have been due to a contaminant, such as benzene (Hathaway et al, 1996). Thrombocytosis (an increase of
platelets in the blood) and thrombocytopenia have been noted in rabbits (Clayton & Clayton, 1994). (Reprotext)

1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene has been positive in a mutagenicity assay (Lewis, 1992). (Reprotext)

4) Xylene

Xylene (mixed isomers) is a component of this product. Effects of chronic exposure to xylene are similar to those of acute
exposure, but may be more severe. Chronic inhalation reportedly was associated with headache, tremors, apprehension,
memory loss, weakness, dizziness, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst, anemia, mucosal
bleeding, enlarged liver, and hyperplasia, but not destruction of the bone marrow (Clayton & Clayton, 1994; ILO, 1983).
Some earlier reports of effects of chronic exposure to xylene have been questioned, as exposures were not limited to
xylene alone.

Effects on the blood have been reported from chronic exposure to as little as 50 mg/m3 (Pap & Varga, 1987). Repeated
exposure can damage bone marrow, causing low blood cell count and can damage the liver and kidneys (NJ Department
of Health, Hazardous Substance Fact Sheet). Chronic xylene exposure (usually mixed with other solvents) has produced
irreversible damage to the CNS (ILO, 1983). CNS effects may be exacerbated by ethanol abuse (Savolainen, 1980).
Xylene may damage hearing or enhance sensitivity to noise in chronic occupational exposures (Morata et al, 1994),
probably from neurotoxic mechanism. Tolerance to xylene can occur over the work week and disappear over the
weekend. (ACGIH, 1992).

Inhalation exposure has produced fetotoxicity and postnatal developmental toxicity in laboratory animals. (API, 1978,
Kensington, MD, EPA/OTS Document No. 878210350 and Hass, U., et al, 1995, Neurotoxicology and Teratology 17: 341349 and 1997, Neurotoxicology 18: 547-552) Xylene has been shown to cause teratogenic effects in mice at does that are
toxic to the mother. (Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health 9:97:105)

Inhalation of hexane has synergistically enhanced the hearing loss caused by inhalation exposure to xylene in laboratory
animals. (Nylén, P., 1996, Food and Chemical Toxicology, 34: 1121-1123 and Nylén, P. and Hagman, M., 1994,
Pharmacology & Toxicology, 74: 124-129)

Xylene has tested positive as a dermal sensitizer. [Altman, A.T. (1977) Archives of Dermatology 113: 1460 and Palmer,
K.T. and Rycroft, R.J. F. (1993) Contact Dermatitis 28: 44]

5) 1,2,3-Trimethylbenzene

Not available.

**6/29/2012.** T3032 _**7/11**_

6) Trimethylbenzene

Trimethylbenzene is a component of this product. Inhalation of vapors in the 5,000 to 7,000 ppm range can cause central
nervous system (CNS) depression. Symptoms include nausea, headache, weakness, dizziness, sleepiness, loss of
coordination, loss of judgment, loss of consciousness, coma, or death (Reprotext).

Blood effects such as anemia and delayed clotting time have been noticed in workers chornically exposed to a solvent
containing trimethylbenzene. These blood effects, however, may have been due to a contaminant in the solvent such as
benzene (a known blood toxin).

7) Cumene

Cumene is a component of this product. Workers chronically exposed to cumene vapors for 7 to 10 years had increased
calcium salt concentrations, alterations of enzymatic activity, lipid metabolism, liver and hepatobiliary functions, and
difficulty performing voluntary movement (Putalova, 1979).

Hyperemia (the presence of an increase in the amount of blood), and congestion were noted in the lungs, liver, and kidneys
of experimental animals following repeated exposure; increased kidney weight was observed with high doses (Snyder,
1987; Werner et al, 1944; Fabre et al, 1955; Wolf et al, 1956; Cushman et al, 1995).

Renal (kidney) proximal tubular cell hypertrophy (an increase in the size of the cell), hyperplasia (an increase in the number
of cells in a tissue or organ, excluding a tumor), and hyaline drop formation (fibroid formation) have also been noted in
experimental animals (ACGIH, 1991; Clayton & Clayton, 1994; Cushman et al, 1995).

Increased fetal death and teratogenicity were reported in the offspring of pregnant rats exposed to the "maximum
permissible" concentration of cumene vapor for 4 months (Serebrennikov & Ogleznev, 1978).

8) Ethylbenzene

Ethylbenzene is a component of this product. Prolonged exposure may result in CNS, upper respiratory tract, blood, and
liver disorders (ILO, 1983). Chronic exposures higher than 100 ppm produced fatigue, headache, drowsiness, and mild
eye and respiratory irritation (Hathaway et al, 1991). Benzene and some alkylbenzene compounds can suppress the bone
marrow, but no original studies were found showing this effect with ethylbenzene (Reprotext).

Slight liver and kidney changes occurred in rats exposed to 600 ppm for up to 16 weeks (Elovaara et al, 1985; Heinonen et
al, 1983). The level of exposure, not the duration, affected the metabolism of ethylbenzene in rats (Engstrom et al, 1985).
(Reprotext)

Ethylbenzene was weakly positive for inducing sister chromatid exchanges in human white blood cells in culture (Norppa &
Vainio, 1983) and produced mutations in mouse lymphocytes. (RTECS)

Ethylbenzene caused retarded skeletal development, extra ribs, tail misplacement, and decreased weight gain in fetal rats
exposed to a high dose of 2,400 mg/m(3) which was also toxic to the mothers (Tatrai et al, 1982). However, much lower
doses of less than 100 ppm produced skeletal abnormalities, affected female fertility, were fetotoxic, and caused smaller
litter sizes in rats. (RTECS) It has been detected in human umbilical cord (fetal) blood (Clayton & Clayton, 1982), and
would thus be available to the fetus. (Reprotext)

Ethylbenzene is classified by the International Agency for Research (IARC) as a Group 2B carcinogen (possibly
carcinogenic to humans). This classification was based on sufficient evidence in animals, but inadequate evidence for
cancer in exposed humans.

The National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded there is clear evidence to support the carcinogenicity of ethylbenzene in
male rats and some evidence in female rats and male and female mice. These observations were based on 2 year
inhalation studies in which the test animals were exposed to 0-750 ppm ethylbenzene. The carcinogenic activity was
observed primarily in the groups exposed to 250 and 750 ppm. The OSHA and ACGIH 8 hour TWA exposure for
ethylbenzene is 100 ppm (NTP TR-466).

In two studies of workers potentially exposed to ethylbenzene, no cancer incidence or mortality was observed (IARC
Monograph 77).
