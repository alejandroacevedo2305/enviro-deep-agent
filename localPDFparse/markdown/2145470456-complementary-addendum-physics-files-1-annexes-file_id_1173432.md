#### COMPONENTS & SPECIFICATIONS

.

Anti-Two-Block (A2B)
A limit switch and an actuation weight on load lines
are provided to prevent two-blocking of the hook block
and the overhaul ball. When the lifting hook reaches its
maximum height, a limit switch will activate the buzzer on
the control panel, meanwhile the indicator light will blink
and automatically stop the lifting operation of hook block.

Backup Alarm
A backup alarm will operate when the machine is placed
in reverse.

Crane Level Indicator
A bubble level displaying the machine angle is mounted
in the operators cab.

Boom Angle Indicator
An angle indicator is mounted on the side of the base
section to show the boom angle. The boom angle is also
displayed on the LML console.

Boom Length Indicator
A cable reel is provided to measure the boom length and
it is displayed on the LML console.

Load Holding Valves
Load holding valves are provided on all cylinders that
support the load to prevent uncontrolled lowering of the
boom in the event of a hydraulic system failure (e.g.,
supply hose rupture).

Load Moment Limiter (LML)
A Load Moment Limiter (LML) system is supplied to
monitor the hook load and compare it with the rated load
for the configuration selected by the operator.

Outrigger Jack Integral Holding Valve
All four outrigger jacks are supplied with an integral
holding valve to prevent cylinder retraction in the event of
a hose failure.

Outrigger Position Sensor
Each outrigger beam is supplied with a position sensor to
monitor the extension of the outrigger beams.

Hoist Drum Rotation Indicator

All drums are equipped with an electric drum
rotation indicator device that will vibrate the

operator’s joystick as the drum rotates.

Horn
The crane is supplied with a horn for the operator to
warn personnel in the vicinity of the crane..

Drum Brake

All hoist drums are equipped with a spring
applied hydraulic released brake. The brake will
automatically apply when the control handle returns
to neutral.

Function Cut-Out

If the arm rest is raised, all crane functions for
operating the superstructure will be deactivated.

Lighting
Equipped with driving lights in front of machine,
stop turn & tail lights in the rear of the machine,
operator’s cab interior light, and a spot light
mounted on the front of the cab.

Rearview Mirror
Externally installed on the left of the operator’s cab
for monitoring the rear of the machine.

Swing Lock
Mechanical pin lock to lock the crane in front
positions.

Seat Switch
The operator must be seated for all machine
functions to work.

Third Wrap Indicator
A roller riding on the hoist wire rope will actuate
a switch to warn the operator when 3 wraps are
remaining. The system will sound a buzzer and an
alarm indicator will be displayed on the instrument
cluster and automatically stop the drum movement.

NOTES TO ALL ON TIRE CAPACITY CHARTS:
1. Capacities are in pounds and do not exceed 75% of
tipping loads as tested in accordance with SAE J765.
2. Capacities are applicable to machines equipped
with 20R25 - ** Bridgestone radial tires at 75 psi cold
inflation pressure.
3. Capacities appearing above the bold line are based
on structural strength and tipping should not be relied
upon as a capacity limitation.
4. Capacities are applicable only with machine on firm
level surface.
5. On tire lifting with the boom extensions is not permitted.
6. For pick and carry operation, boom must be centered
over the front of the machine with the swing lock
engaged and the load restrained from swinging.
7. Axle lockouts must be functioning when lifting on tires.
8. All lifting depends on proper tire inflation, capacity
and condition. Capacities must be reduced for lower
tire inflation pressures. See lifting capacity information
for tire used. Damaged tires are hazardous to safe
operation of crane.

- This rated load is with the boom at the maximum boom angle.

WARNING: Operation of this machine with heavier loads than the capacities listed is strictly prohibited. Machine tipping with boom
extension occurs rapidly and without advance warning.

1. Capacities above the bold line are based on the structural strength of the boom extension.
2. The capacities listed are with the outriggers fully extended and vertical jacks properly set only.
3. The boom extension may only be used for single line lifting service.
4. Use only the load which corresponds to the boom extension length and offset angle as the machine is configured.
5. For main boom lengths less than fully extended with the boom extension erected, the boom extension rated loads are
determined by the boom angle not the radius.
6. For boom angles not shown, use the rating of the next lower boom angle.
7. The boom angle is defined as the angle above or below the horizontal line of the longitudinal axis of the boom base section
after lifting the rated load.
8. When lifting over the main boom nose with the boom extension erected, the outriggers must be fully extended and the proper
load reduction must be used.
9. Do not lower the boom below the Minimum Boom Angle with the extension erected. Fully retract the boom to lower the boom
below the Minimum Boom Angle.
