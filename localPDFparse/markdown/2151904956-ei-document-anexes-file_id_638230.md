1 For ambient and altitude capabilities consult your Cat dealer. Air flow restriction (system) is added to existing restriction from factory.

2 UL 2200 Listed packages may have oversized generators with a different temperature rise and motor starting characteristics. Generator
temperature rise is based on a 40 degree C ambient per NEMA MG1-32.
3 Emissions data measurement procedures are consistent with those described in EPA CFR 40 Part 89, Subpart D & E and ISO8178-1 for
measuring HC, CO, PM, NOx. Data shown is based on steady state operating conditions of 77oF, 28.42 in HG and number 2 diesel fuel
with 35o API and LHV of 18,390 btu/lb. The nominal emissions data shown is subject to instrumentation, measurement, facility and engine
to engine variations. Emissions data is based on 100% load and thus cannot be used to compare to EPA regulations which use values
based on a weighted cycle.

### RATING DEFINITIONS AND CONDITIONS

**Meets or Exceeds International Specifications:** AS1359,

CSA, IEC60034-1, ISO3046, ISO8528, NEMA MG 1-22,

NEMA MG 1-33, UL508A, 72/23/EEC, 98/37/EC,

2004/108/EC
**Standby** - Output available with varying load for the

duration of the interruption of the normal source power.

Average power output is 70% of the standby power

rating. Typical operation is 200 hours per year, with

maximum expected usage of 500 hours per year.

Standby power in accordance with ISO8528. Fuel stop

power in accordance with ISO3046. Standby ambients

shown indicate ambient temperature at 100% load which

results in a coolant top tank temperature just below the

shutdown temperature.

**Ratings** are based on SAE J1349 standard conditions.

These ratings also apply at ISO3046 standard conditions.
**Fuel rates** are based on fuel oil of 35o API [16o C (60o F)]

gravity having an LHV of 42 780 kJ/kg (18,390 Btu/lb)

when used at 29o C (85o F) and weighing 838.9 g/liter

(7.001 lbs/U.S. gal.). Additional ratings may be available

for specific customer requirements, contact your Cat

representative for details. For information regarding Low

Sulfur fuel and Biodiesel capability, please consult your

Cat dealer.
