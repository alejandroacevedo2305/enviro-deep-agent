Your permit conditions

**1. Introduction**

This document is part of a suite of guidance notes issued by the Environment Agency [1] .
These notes are designed to help both holders and potential holders of permits understand
how to apply for, vary and comply with their permits. This document supersedes the previous
draft H4 guidance and the Environment Agency’s internal guidance on the management of
odour at waste facilities.

The top level in this suite is _[How to Comply with your Permit](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/32320.aspx)_ which covers a large proportion
of what an operator needs to know. There are then notes that cover issues specific to
particular business sectors, and “horizontal” notes that go into more detail on particular topics
[such as risk assessment, noise or odour. H4 is one of these “horizontal” topic notes. Click](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/36414.aspx)
[here](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/36414.aspx) [2] to see a complete list of the sector and “horizontal” notes, which are all available from
our website.

[The Environmental Permitting Regulations](http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/permitting/) (the “EP Regulations”) require the control of
pollution including odour. This guidance covers our regulatory requirements with regard to
odour, advice on the management of odour and the aspects that should be dealt with in an
odour management plan (OMP). This guidance does not apply to UWWTD [3] facilities (unless
they are subject to the IPPC Directive), standalone water discharges, groundwater
authorisations, radioactive substance activities or any other activity which is not subject to an
odour condition in a permit.

If you are making a new application you should first refer to the Environmental Permitting
[application form which will lead you through the necessary steps. Click here](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/32318.aspx) [4] for the
application form and guidance. [5]

Your permit conditions

**2. Your permit conditions**

For an explanation of how our approach to permitting delivers the requirements set out in
legislation see _[RGN4 - Setting Standards in Environmental Permits.](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/36419.aspx)_

Depending on its age, your permit may express an odour condition using different terms. For
example, the permit may state that the operator must not cause nuisance, annoyance,
offensive odours, offence to man’s senses, interference with amenities, pollution etc. It may
require the use of Best Available Techniques (BAT), appropriate measures, due diligence or
all reasonable precautions to minimise odour.

The relevant legislation also uses a variety of terminology. For example, the Landfill
Directive says “ _Measures shall be taken to minimise nuisances and hazards arising from the_
_landfill through emissions of odours_ ”, whereas the IPPC Directive includes odour in the
definition of pollution and says “.... _.all the appropriate preventive measures are taken against_
_pollution .....”._

Whichever form of words is used in the permit we will treat it as having the same meaning as
explained in Section 3. Accordingly, in this Guidance when we refer to the obligation not to
cause pollution and the requirement to use appropriate measures we intend these
expressions to encompass all the terms referred to above that may be found in the various
odour conditions.

In other words, appropriate measures will be those that are required by the relevant
legislation. For example, for IPPC installations, they will be BAT as defined in the IPPC/IED
Directives or for waste sites they will be the “relevant objectives” as defined in the Waste
Framework Directive. In most cases, however, the standard that is required for the control of
odour will be the same.

We would not require you to go beyond appropriate measures unless serious pollution was
being caused. However, appropriate measures may require more measures to be taken
where the risk of pollution is greater. Furthermore, there may be circumstances where you
may choose to apply innovative methods which are not yet recognised as BAT, but which
you consider to be necessary to solve a particular problem.

**2.1 The Conditions**

The current form of odour condition used in our environmental permits is shown below and
usually consists of two elements:

 - the odour boundary condition, which specifies the outcome which the operator must
achieve (i.e. no pollution beyond the site boundary); and

 a condition requiring compliance with an OMP (where activities are considered likely
to give rise to odour)

There may also be specific operational conditions relating to odour control which require
certain techniques or specify emission limits.

_**The Odour Boundary Condition**_

_Emissions from the activities shall be free from odour at levels likely to cause_
_pollution outside the site, as perceived by an authorised officer of the Agency, unless_
_the operator has used appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, those_

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 3

Your permit conditions

_specified in an approved odour management plan, to prevent or where that is not_
_practicable to minimise the odour._ _[6]_

You must employ the appropriate measures necessary to prevent the odour pollution or
minimise it when prevention is not practicable. The measures that are appropriate will
depend on your industry sector and your site-specific circumstances and will take costs and
benefits into account.

The underlined portion of the odour boundary condition ensures that operators will not be in
breach of that condition provided they are using appropriate measures. However, even if the
operator is using all appropriate measures, if we consider the residual odour is at such a
level that it is unreasonable it will be necessary for the operator to take further measures to
reduce odour pollution or risk having to reduce or cease operations. Where the residual
odour pollution is, or is likely to be, unacceptable we will work closely with operators to help
them find solutions that will avoid this eventuality.

The condition and the benchmarks given in this guidance are based on odour levels at the
boundary. If there are no receptors close to the boundary we will normally permit a facility
that meets the criteria at the nearest receptor.

However even where the facility has not caused odour problems in the past the operator may
have to take action to prevent or, where that is not practicable, minimise actual or potential
odour pollution if circumstances change e.g. a new residential development is built near to
the site boundary. You may decide to design to the tighter (boundary) standard to futureproof your investment.

Figure 1 illustrates this approach.

**Figure 1- Three levels of odour**

**Unreasonable** **odour** amounting to serious pollution is being or is likely to be
caused (regardless of whether appropriate measures are being used).

You must take further action or you may have to reduce or cease operations.
The Environment Agency would not issue a permit if it considered that you
were likely to be operating at this level.

**Odour** pollution is or is likely to be caused beyond boundary.

**Your duty** is to use appropriate measures to minimise odour.

**You are not in breach** if you are using appropriate measures.

If appropriate measures are being used, residual odour will have to be
tolerated by the community. For some activities appropriate measures will
achieve no smell beyond the boundary.

**No odour** beyond the boundary or likely to be

= no pollution = no action needed

From consideration of Figure 1 it will be evident that, in any particular case, we have to
decide:

**Step 1** : whether or not unreasonable odour pollution is being or is likely to be caused, even if
appropriate measures are used, and

6 If an existing permit contains an odour boundary condition without the appropriate measures defence, we shall act as though
it were present. An operator may have a non-chargable variation to include this provision, although this is not necessary to
provide protection. The provision will be added when a permit comes up for review or variation for any other reason.

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 4

Your permit conditions

**Step 2:** if the odour pollution is not or is not likely to be at the unreasonable level, whether
appropriate measures are being used

Section 3 describes how to go about assessing these two steps.

An OMP (where required) plays a part in identifying the appropriate measures for a particular
site. However, an OMP may not contain all the appropriate measures that need to be used,
particularly if it has not been recently reviewed or circumstances have changed.

_**The Odour Management Plan Conditions**_

For the activities listed in Annex 2 of _[How to Comply with your Permit](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/32320.aspx)_ which are likely to give
rise to odour problems an OMP has to be submitted for approval as part of the permitting
process. There is a general operational condition (2A), in such permits, that requires the
operator to comply with this plan and to submit revisions of the plan in the future, should this

prove necessary.

# 2A (a) The activities shall, subject to the conditions of this permit, be operated

_**using the techniques and in the manner described in the documentation**_
_**specified in Schedule 1, Table S1.2, unless otherwise agreed in writing by**_
_**the Environment Agency.**_

# _(b) If notified by the Environment Agency that the activities are giving rise to_

_**pollution, the operator shall submit to the Environment Agency for**_
_**approval within the period specified, a revision of any plan specified in**_
_**Schedule 1, Table S1.2 or otherwise required under this permit, and shall**_
_**implement the approved revised plan in place of the original from the date**_
_**of approval, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Agency.**_

Permits for sites carrying out activities that have a low odour risk will contain condition 2B
below, which allows us to require an OMP should there be an unexpected odour problem
after the permit has been granted.

**2B.** _The operator shall:_

# _(a) if notified by the Environment Agency that the activities are giving rise to_

_**pollution outside the site due to odour, submit to the Environment Agency**_
_**for approval within the period specified, a new or revised odour**_
_**management plan;**_

# _(b) implement the approved odour management plan, from the date of_

_**approval, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Environment Agency.**_

The provisions of your OMP are treated as part of your permit and must be complied with.
Compliance with your approved OMP will usually be an excellent way of showing that your
process is being properly controlled.

All OMPs should, as a minimum, include the information contained in Appendix 4.:It should
clearly demonstrate your competence and commitment to controlling odour pollution. It
should be apparent that you understand how your process could give rise to odour pollution
and that you have the capability to manage that risk effectively.

You should review the effectiveness of your odour control measures at least once a year.
This interval may be shorter if there have been complaints or relevant changes to your
operations or infrastructure.

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 5

Your permit conditions

Information as to the appropriate measures we would normally expect an operator to have
taken is provided in Section 4 [and in sector guidance. For some sectors we have also](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/32320.aspx)
prepared example or template OMPs.

**2.2** **Approval of odour management plans**

When we approve your OMP we will agree the scope and suitability of key measures but this
should not be taken as confirmation that the details of equipment specification design,
operation and maintenance are suitable and sufficient. That remains your responsibility.

If we consider your OMP is deficient in certain aspects or it does not contain all the
necessary appropriate measures we will ask you to amend it to include these. If you decline
to do so we may:

 - approve your plan subject to additional requirements or provisos (we would only do
this for minor aspects);

 approve your OMP in as far as it goes but set out in writing the ways in which we
consider it to be deficient and, in particular, which additional appropriate measures
you should be taking. If an odour pollution incident occurs as a result of your failure
to take any of these additional appropriate measures then it will be more difficult for
you to demonstrate that you were using appropriate measures in any subsequent
enforcement action;

 - impose a requirement on you. However we would only do this by a method that you
will have the right to appeal, e.g. a permit condition or enforcement notice;

 where the OMP is submitted as part of an application, we may consider it necessary
to refuse that application.

We recognise that no OMP can cover every eventuality and even if you are taking all the
appropriate measures specified
in your approved OMP, odour **Example: breach of the odour condition despite**

major release. The inset box gives a specific example of such a situation.
If you need to carry out rapid action to solve an odour problem, it is possible that your actions
may contravene something in your OMP. Clearly the priority is to take the necessary action
to solve the problem. You should do this and bring the OMP up to date after the event.

Assessing the level of odour pollution and
appropriate measures

**3. Assessing the level of odour pollution and appropriate measures**

As stated in Section 2, whichever terms are used in the odour condition in your permit (e.g.
nuisance or annoyance) we will interpret these as meaning pollution.

Pollution is an emission which may be harmful to human health or the quality of the
environment, cause offence to a human sense or impair or interfere with amenities or other
legitimate uses of the environment. [7]
A final determination as to whether there has been a permit breach will involve an
assessment of the level and effect of the emissions and the appropriateness of the measures
being employed.

Referring to Figure 1, there are two key steps in assessing the level of odour pollution and
appropriate measures.

**Step 1: Is there serious pollution?**

Whether or not odour emissions amount to serious pollution depends on a number of factors.
There is no single method of reliably measuring or assessing odour pollution, and any
conclusion is best based on a number of pieces of evidence.

The **FIDOR** **[8]** acronym is a useful reminder of the factors that will determine the degree of
odour pollution

 - Frequency of detection;

 - **I** ntensity as perceived [9] ;

 - **D** uration of exposure;

 - Offensiveness [10] ;

 - Receptor sensitivity

**Frequency and duration** can be assessed from emissions and process control data, wind
direction data, complaints and odour diaries

**Exposure intensity** can be assessed from monitoring information for example:

 - sniff testing (which gives a judgement of intensity and offensiveness);

 - the use of a field dilution olfactometer;

 - complaints and odour diaries;

 - emissions or ambient air monitoring where feasible.

For new proposals the expected exposure arising from different options can be estimated
through, for example:

 - modelling to the standards given in Appendix 3;

7 The definition of pollution is set out in Regulation 2 of the EP Regulations.

8 The term FIDOL is sometimes used instead, in which the L stands for Location (of receptors).

9 **The intensity** of an odour is a logarithmic function of its concentration. So increasing the concentration of an odorous
chemical or mixture by a factor of 10 might increase its perceived intensity by a factor of about 2. Conversely, if a site causes
odour pollution, abatement equipment might need to remove ~90 per cent of the odour-causing substances in order to halve the
intensity of odour as perceived in the community. Adaptation means that the perceived intensity of an odour diminishes rapidly
with constant exposure.

10 **The offensiveness** of an odour includes its hedonic tone. Offensiveness takes account of exposure and the attributes that
determine nuisance sensitivity whereas hedonic tome is measured in a laboratory situation aimed simply at “like” or “dislike”..
The hedonic tones for common odours are in Appendix 2 Table A2.1.

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 7

Assessing the level of odour pollution and
appropriate measures

 - evidence of other similar operations carried out in similar circumstances - when
making these comparisons you should take into account the degree of relevance of
the comparative sites, in particular:

 - the comparative site may have different weather and dispersion conditions
(including topography);

 - odorous emissions can differ in frequency, intensity, duration or offensiveness
because of different feedstock materials, operating conditions or engineering
differences;

 - the quality of monitoring data at the comparative site may be poor or no such data
may be available;

 - the community affected by the proposed site may be more or less tolerant or
further away than that at the comparative site.

For some sectors example emission rates may be available, e.g. there are published
isopleths for pig farms.

All evidence will need to be carefully considered to ensure that sites are indeed comparable
and that measurement uncertainties have been taken into account.

**Offensiveness:** some odours are generally regarded as more unpleasant than others and
therefore need to be subject to greater control. For more information see Appendix 3.

**Receptor sensitivity** (Location) needs to be considered carefully

 Some receptors are more sensitive than others. Domestic residences, or a pub with
a beer garden are more likely to be sensitive than an industrial complex or passersby.

 Some individuals will be extremely tolerant of odours at high intensities while others
will be unable to tolerate an odour as soon as they identify it. Evidence that, for
example, only one person finds the odour unacceptable whereas most others,
similarly exposed, find it acceptable in that context (e.g. in a rural village) would be
relevant to the assessment of the degree of pollution.

 - There are a very small number of people (e.g. Addison’s sufferers), who have
conditions which put them well outside the normal range of sensitivities (see
Appendix 2 Figure A2.1) and make them able to detect very low concentrations of
odour. We would not expect an operator to design a system to satisfy those
individuals.

 - The degree of pollution increases with the size of the exposed population. Therefore,
the more people that are affected the greater will be the justifiable expenditure on
control measures. However, even if only a very small number of individuals are
affected, the seriousness of the exposure may require further control measures.

 - For new proposals, an assessment should be made of the sensitivity of existing and
likely future receptors e.g. complaints history, local development plans etc.

People living near odorous sites often express concerns about possible health impacts from
the odours they perceive. We will consult with the Health Protection Agency (HPA)/Public
Health Wales (PHW) in relation to public health issues as described in our joint Working
Together Agreement.

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 8

Assessing the level of odour pollution and
appropriate measures

**Step 2: Is the operator taking appropriate measures?**

Whether you are using all appropriate measures or BAT needs to be informed by a
combination of:

 - [BREFS (where available - click here for list);](http://eippcb.jrc.es/reference/)

 - the relevant sections of this guidance;

 - [more specific guidance including Environment Agency sector guidance notes (click](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/32320.aspx)
[here](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/32320.aspx) for list);

 - information on other techniques employed in the sector such as industry guidance,
and best practice.

When determining what the appropriate measures will be for a site we will factor in needs,
costs and benefits. In practice this means that the higher the level of pollution (assessed in
accordance with the criteria set out in Step 1 above), the more measures you will be
expected to take and the greater the justifiable financial investment will be.

In summary, and as outlined in Figure 1, this approach will result in the following scenarios:

 - Where no odour is detectable, or likely to be detectable, beyond the boundary of your
site there will be no pollution, and no further action in relation to odour pollution will be
required;

 - Where odour is detectable, it may or may not cause offence and our response will
depend upon the degree of pollution and the cost and practicability of any remedial

measures.

 - Where all appropriate measures are being used but are not completely preventing
odour pollution, a level of residual odour will have to be accepted.

 - Where the odour is serious, even if all efforts have been made to apply
BAT/appropriate measures, it may be necessary to suspend or revoke your permit in
full or in part.

The degree of residual odour that one would expect from an activity that is using all
appropriate measures (BAT) will vary from sector to sector, as it is easier to control odour in
some sectors than others. For some activities there should be no odour at all beyond the
boundary.

If you have, or are likely to have, an odour problem then you should set out in your odour
management plan the appropriate measures you intend to use. The following sections give
advice on how to do that.

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 9

Control measures

**4. Control measures**

Your OMP will need to consider the measures you will take to control odour. This guidance
provides a general explanation of how you should tackle odour issues and describes types of
control measures and plant that should be considered to prevent or abate pollution.
However, it does not consider the detail of plant design, operation or maintenance. We
expect operators to be knowledgeable of current appropriate measures in their sector. Some
of the current measures specific to particular sectors are given in sector guidance.

We advise you to take a systematic approach, considering all measures under each of the
following headings and giving priority to controls that can be used at the earliest possible
stage in the process:

 - Managing inventory

 Controlling evaporation

 - Containment and abatement

 - Dispersion

 - Reducing impacts

The most effective strategies may or may not involve large capital investment, but most
measures will need careful management. The ultimate action for you to take is likely to be
reducing or stopping odour-causing activities altogether, at least until circumstances change,
or you have resolved the problem.

Technology and BAT/appropriate measures are constantly changing. You should use the
latest and most effective control measures available for your industry sector. You should
base your decisions on the appropriate measures for your industry, taking costs and benefits
into account. . However, it is unlikely that we would expect you to upgrade your equipment
just because better plant comes along, as long as your existing measures are proving
effective.

**4.1** **Receipt and management of odorous materials**

Many feedstock materials, particularly putrescible wastes or animal by-products, can become
very odorous before they arrive at your site. You should liaise with your feedstock suppliers
about this. For example, for waste management facilities, your contracts may need to
specify:

 - which types of waste the processing plant or local authority collection teams will
receive, and which they will reject;

 - how long the waste can be held before it is delivered;

 - storage and treatment conditions;

 - any appropriate pre-treatment before the waste is dispatched;

 - transport conditions (refrigeration, for example);

 - the need to divert wastes if you have operational difficulties or you’ve exceeded your
capacity.

In any case you should:

 - treat odorous materials promptly in a way which reduces their odour potential;

 - keep odorous materials on site to a minimum, rotating stock where appropriate;

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 10

Control measures

 - generate as little extra odorous chemicals as possible by, for example, minimising
temperatures or maintaining aerobic conditions;

 - consider your housekeeping regime and select building materials which can be easily
cleaned.

If this is not enough, then you should have procedures in place so that you can identify and
reject highly odorous wastes.

Some sites will be specifically designed to manage odorous feedstock materials, or materials
over which they have more limited control. These sites will require much more robust
management controls.

**4.2** **Transfer of odorous chemicals to air**

You can control many odorous chemicals (at least partly) by reducing their rate of
evaporation. The methods to do so can be either chemical or physical. You can, for example:

 - lower the temperature by avoiding direct sunlight or otherwise reducing the water
evaporation rate and the release of dissolved odorous chemicals;

 - increase humidity in the immediate environment to reduce evaporation, as above;

 - reduce airflow over the surface of odour-releasing materials to reduce the rate of
evaporation;

 - control the acidity/alkalinity of a material to make specific smelly chemicals much
more soluble in water and less likely to evaporate, for example, acidic conditions (low
pH) can suppress the evaporation of alkaline chemicals such as ammonia.
Conversely, alkaline conditions (high pH) can suppress odorous acidic chemicals
such as propionic acid or acetic acid;

 - introduce temporary surface treatments to lower the surface temperature or create a
chemical barrier. Plain water is the simplest and is often helpful; these treatments
can also contain pH buffers as above or other chemicals to make odorous chemicals
more soluble. You should carefully assess any commercial treatments that claim to
suppress or break down odorous chemicals - one study found no relationship
between the cost of commercial surface treatment products and how well they work;

 - reduce the surface area of an odorous material; this will cut the rate of evaporation;

 - avoid disruptive activities such as shredding or screening, which dramatically
increase exposed surface area and emissions, unless adequate containment is
provided.

**4.3** **Containment of contaminated air**

If you cannot avoid producing significant levels of odorous air, you will need to contain the
emissions before treating them.

 Choose containment and treatment methods together so that you can coordinate the
most appropriate treatment with management of ventilation rates.

 - Localised containment lowers the volume of air required to be treated. It will normally
be much more cost effective than if you rely entirely on a large building for primary
containment.

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 11

Control measures

 - Where you are relying on containment to control continuous odour you should
maintain effective airflow by pressure control within the process plant or within
process buildings. ‘Air-lock’ entry and exit doors will enable the integrity to be
maintained. Complex air management systems which are affected by thermal lofting
or complex ducting arrangements will need to be designed by competent engineers.

 - Keep windows and doors on buildings used for containment shut. Pedestrian doors
should be self-closing.

 - Be aware that two openings on either side of a building can create a through-draft
and carry odours out.

 Consider all of the normal techniques for minimising VOC emissions from tanks and
pipework (see the section on fugitive emissions in _[How to Comply with your Permit](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/32320.aspx)_ ).

 Check pipes, valves and tanks regularly for leaks and damage.

In some cases air tight containment measures, such as pressure vessels in an anaerobic
digestion plant, will not require ventilation at all except to transfer gasses produced to an
engine. Any venting via a relief vale should be considered as an emergency and investigated
and managed to prevent recurrence.

**4.4** **End of pipe treatment**

There are many ways to treat air from contained sources. They are, in general, the same
techniques used for chemical abatement:

 - adsorption using activated carbon, zeolite, alumina (disposable or with regeneration);

 - dry chemical scrubbing - solid phase impregnated with chemical agents such as pH
modifiers, chlorine dioxide or permanganate;

 - biological treatment - trickling biofilters, soil bed biofilters, non-soil biofilters - (peat,
heather, wood bark, compost), bioscrubbers;

 - absorption (scrubbing) - spray and packed towers, plate absorbers (single pass or
recirculating);

 - thermal treatment - existing boiler plant, thermal or catalytic oxidation;

 - other techniques - odour treatment chemicals, condensation, plasma technology
(ozone), catalytic iron filters and UV.

A number of sources of information on such techniques are suggested in the Bibliography.

It is very common to use hybrid or combined methods. For example, many activated carbon
products are impregnated with dry chemical scrubbing reagents and ozone methods
sometimes work best after excess moisture have been reduced by condensation.

As with containment, it is typically cheaper and more effective to treat small quantities of
highly odorous air than it is to treat large volumes of less odorous air.

If a site has two odorous exhaust streams with very different chemical characteristics, it is
often cheaper and more effective to treat them separately.

Biofilters need careful and expert maintenance of their microbial health to maintain their
effectiveness.

You may find opportunities for abatement in existing plant and materials. Combustion plants
such as boilers or compost heaps, for example, can often treat low-volume high-odour

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 12

Control measures

streams. They can do this either on their own, as a primary treatment before a polishing step,
or before enhanced dispersion through an elevated stack.

Some processes are very dusty, and odour may be associated with the dust. Examples
include some pharmaceutical processes, poultry farms and animal feed mills. You might be
able to reduce odour by filtering out the dust or using mist eliminators for droplets. Some
forms of abatement equipment will need preliminary particulate control. Packed bed
scrubbers, for example, will need protection. You may be able to recycle the collected
particulate matter, particularly if it has some value.

Proprietary odour treatment chemicals can be effective within a process or abatement
chamber where effective mixing can take place. They may also work within a building such
as a waste reception hall or on in a farm building where there is sufficient time for mixing to
occur. These products may chemically react with the odorous components to remove them
or convert them to less odorous compounds that have a lower hedonic score and are
therefore less offensive. In ambient air they are less effective as there is very limited control
over mixing. Nevertheless they can be beneficial in some situations. Simple water misting,
surfactants or buffers may be as effective as more complex agents. Masking agents which
inhibit the recipients sense of smell should not be used. Perfumes are often perceived as
offensive as the original odour and are simply adding another pollutant to the air.

**4.5** **Transport and dispersion**

High stacks may be used to allow odorous emissions to disperse before they reach the
ground. Similarly, where it is possible to increase the physical distance to receptors, this can
also reduce exposure. Dispersion modelling (Appendix 4) can be used to assess the
benefits of these measures. Where feasible, some dispersion benefits may be realised
through arranging emissions points at locations which are further away from nearby
receptors.

You may be able to avoid peak impacts by timing your operations. For example, suspending
operations when there are inversion or cold drainage flow conditions or when the wind
direction is towards nearby residents, or by undertaking activities at a time of day when
residents are not present or are likely to be indoors. Where this is part of your control
strategy you should be monitoring weather and forecasts so that you are ready to take swift
action to avoid problems.

**4.6** **Engaging your neighbours**

It is really important for you to engage with the people who may be affected by your activities.
Many operators do this as a matter of course and have well-established procedures for
interfacing with the general public. However, some operators overlook this essential step.

Your neighbours are likely to perceive odours from your site quite differently from you or your
employees. For your neighbours, odours may:

 - cause annoyance;

 - reduce enjoyment of home and gardens;

 - reduce property values;

 - raise concerns about exposure to harmful emissions (e.g. bio aerosols);

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 13

Control measures

 - cause them to view your facility as a liability to the community, rather than an asset.

Engaging with, and becoming an active member of, the local community may enable
operators to mitigate the impact of their activities and increase tolerance of odours,
particularly where those odours are relatively transient.

Engagement can include a wide variety of activities, but communication is always a key
aspect. This means being a reliable source of information to the community and being
available to hear what they have to say. Exactly how you establish channels of
communication depends upon what you and the community are comfortable with.

Active participation in the community not only helps people to get to know you and your staff,
but also helps people to understand what you do and, possibly, even view you as an asset.
Some of your employees may live in the surrounding community and can be important as
ambassadors for your business.

**4.7** **Responding to complaints**

Your odour management plan should show how you respond to complaints.

You should investigate any complaints promptly and take appropriate remedial action. You
should tell the complainant and any one else likely to have been affected by what you have
done. You should record the details of the complaint and the actions you have taken. An
example of complaint recording is given in Appendix 1.

If you need to substantiate the odour, a record form and advice for sniff testing are also given
in Appendix 1. However, if you and your staff have become accustomed to the odour
through exposure the results may be unreliable. (see adaptation in Appendix 2).

When investigating a complaint you should work through the following questions:

 Is the process under control? (Have you received exceptionally odorous wastes?
Has a normally aerobic composting activity become anaerobic? Have putrescible
wastes been left standing for too long before processing?)

 Have odour containment measures failed? (Has a door been left open? Have
odorous materials been stored outside a containment area? Have adverse
conditions, such as weather, overwhelmed containment structures?)

 Have treatment measures failed? (Has a carbon scrubber become saturated? Has a
biofilter been temporarily overloaded? Does a wet scrubber need maintenance?)

 Have dispersion methods failed? (Have stable atmospheric conditions failed to
disperse an odorous plume? Have your neighbours been exposed to emissions
because of unfavourable night-time cold drainage flow conditions?)

 - If the odour is associated with hazards, such as treatment of hazardous materials, is
there any possibility of health risk to the local community?

You should keep auditable records of any investigations you carry out. These records will be
invaluable to you in analysing incidents and stopping them from happening again. They may
in any event be required as part of your OMP or permit conditions.

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 14

Control measures

**4.8** **Ceasing or reducing operations**

Sometimes, your investigation will show that you need to stop some activities immediately or
take some other remedial action. You should be ready for this. Plan effective and
proportionate remedial measures and develop contingency plans to apply them. If you think
that a particular activity will cause odour problems, then in most cases you should suspend
that activity until effective controls are in place. The main exceptions to this would be when
to stop one activity would cause even greater odour problems e.g. delaying turning a
composting windrow may make anaerobic conditions worse, or where to cease operating
immediately would give rise to health or welfare issues e.g. in the intensive farming sector.

**4.9** **Actions when problems arise - your accident management**
**plan**
Your permit may require you to maintain an accident management plan in which you may
choose to address odour-related accidents. If you also have an OMP it may be more
appropriate to cover odour-related accidents in that document, identifying the appropriate
response to a situation and who is responsible for taking preventative action after an
incident.

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 15

Monitoring

**5 Monitoring**

You need to assess your odorous substances emissions so that you can work out how
effective your control measures are. What you do in terms of monitoring will need to reflect
the actual or potential impact on the local community. The following includes a brief
overview of available monitoring methods and their applicability.

**5.1** **Your monitoring plan**

You should be clear about reasons for monitoring in order to identify how best to carry it out.
You may want, for example, to:

 - assess impact (using complaints, community questionnaires, interviews and field sniff
testing);

 - assess exposure (using field surveys, field dilution olfactometry, surrogate
monitoring);

 - investigate sources and pathways (using fence line monitoring, meteorological
monitoring);

 - measure releases (using dynamic dilution olfactometry, surrogate monitoring,
assessment against emission limit values);

 - control processes (using temperature, oxygen levels, pH, moisture).

Monitoring can take several different forms:

 - sniff testing (to check ambient air on or off site);

 - meteorological monitoring - very simple, low risk, sites may get away with indirect
(e.g. local airfield met data) or observation methods, most, though, will require
appropriately configured on-site data-logging instruments;

 - complaints (direct complaints, as well as those made to the Environment Agency or a
third party such as a local authority);

 - odour diaries;

 surrogate chemicals or process parameters (e.g. H2S, ammonia, odourless methane
as an indicator of odorous landfill gas etc, pH and flow in a scrubber);

 - emissions monitoring if there is a point of discharge;

 - grab samples of source emissions that are subsequently diluted to the odour
threshold in a laboratory setting (i.e. BSEN 13725 Dynamic Dilution Olfactometry);
ports may be necessary in order to obtain representative samples from stacks but
these ports should never be used directly for sniffing unless the odour levels are
moderate and the stack is known to contain healthy, breathable air.

Your monitoring plan should include:

 - why and how monitoring will take place, for example:

 - steady state monitoring to confirm that odour is under control - regular sniff tests
and if appropriate, continuous monitors or process surrogates;

 assessment against any emissions limits in your permit or OMP;

 - if an odour problem arises, the monitoring you will carry out to establish what
needs to be done;

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 16

Monitoring

 - if you have put a solution in place, the monitoring that you will do to confirm that it
has resolved the problem;

 - how to interpret the results including, whenever feasible, trigger values for further
monitoring or remedial action;

 - if the terrain is complex, or if odours come from many places, how monitoring will
handle this;

 - record-keeping and reporting.

**5.2** **Issues to take into account in any ambient air monitoring**

Whether using sniff testing or taking samples you should take account of the points set out
below.

 - It is often difficult for investigators to witness odour incidents that are episodic and
short-lived.

 - Emissions are greatly diluted from their point of release, and are often below
detection limits of instruments but can still be detected by people.

 - Peaks in exposure may be due to changing dispersion conditions (wind direction,
turbulence) or variable emissions (doors opened).

 - Emissions from elevated stacks may reach the ground beyond the monitoring point.

 - It can be difficult to work out where an emission comes from or to distinguish it from
other sources.

While chemical detection can be improved by sampling more air and concentrating this on a
sorption device, this only provides average concentrations. These bear little relevance to the
peak events that can cause annoyance / offence etc. The variable nature of many odour
exposure scenarios and the short term of some sampling methods mean that it is much
easier to demonstrate exposure than to conclude that no exposure has taken place.

**5.3** **Complaints monitoring**

Complaints are a direct indication that odours may be causing pollution. Accordingly,
responding to them is an important aspect of site management, as described in Section 4.7
above.

As with other aspects of a monitoring strategy, thought should be given to how this
information is gathered, managed and understood. The best approach to take will be
influenced by the nature of complaints as well as fundamental characteristics of our sense of
smell. Further discussion on the sense of smell and annoyance can be found in Appendix 2
and several related references in the bibliography. The following points should be noted
when assessing complaints information:

 - Op erators may receive complaints directly from community members, or indirectly
from the Environment Agency or a Local Authority.

 Complaints may be received immediately following an odour incident, or some time
later.

 Community members may have concerns about other issues such as flies, dust and
noise. Complaints may therefore relate to more than just odour.

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 17

Monitoring

 - Odours may cause people to become concerned about the potential for exposure to harmful emissions
such as chemicals or bio-aerosols. These concerns may be amplified where they or
their family members have health problems.

 - It is normal for odours to cause an emotional response.

 - People can usually give a good account of their experience of odour. However,
depending upon the number and type of odour sources in the area, they may or may
not be able to correctly identify the source.

 - With pr actice, most people have an inherent ability to recognise a very large number of
individual odours. However, the experiences and descriptions of specific odours may
vary considerably from one person to another

 - Most people have a very limited vocabulary to describe odours.

Consideration also needs to be given to how odour complaints can be used to assess the
magnitude of odour exposure and annoyance in the community. Such an assessment is
complicated on the one hand by factors which may suggest an overestimate of annoyance,
and on other factors which will suppress complaints, for example:

 - complaints may be partly motivated by other issues such as litigation or neighbour
disputes about other issues;

 - there may be concerns about other pollutants such as flies, dust or noise;

 - people may not know who to complain to;

 - people may be concerned about the potential for retaliation, labelling, reduced house
prices or other adverse consequences arising from complaints;

 - there may be a perception that nothing will be done about the complaint.

A complaints monitoring strategy should therefore seek to include an understanding of those
factors which might lead to an over or underestimate of impact and seek to reduce these
influences wherever possible. For example, community outreach activities can help to
overcome some of the factors which inhibit complaints and foster good community relations
thereby resulting in complaints records which more accurately reflect odour pollution impacts.
To the extent these influences cannot be completely removed, efforts should be made to
understand them and take them into account.

If operators feel that complaints are motivated by issues other than odour concerns then they
should raise this with the local Agency officer.

**5.4** **Sniff testing**

Sniff testing is a common form of odour monitoring. While the factors mentioned in this
section need to be taken into account in order to minimise inconsistencies, it can provide
good evidence of an odour problem. Monitoring results will be improved if observers have
been trained and understand their own sensitivities.

Example forms and advice for sniff testing and other useful forms are given in Appendix 1.

Never put yourself or others at risk by attempting to sniff potentially hazardous emissions and
always be mindful of physical hazards associated with sniff testing locations.

Self-monitoring by operators using this method may not be ideal because staff working at the
site get used to (i.e. they adapt to) odours from the site and this adaptation means that they
may not be able to assess the level of odour objectively. More information on adaptation

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 18

Monitoring

can be found in Appendix 3. You should therefore consider using independent contractors or
even members of the community.

The points in Section 5.2 also need to be taken into account.

More objectivity may sometimes be brought to sniff testing by the use of aids such as a field
dilution olfactometer. The only device currently available is the Nasal Ranger. This device
can assist investigators in assessing the concentration of odours in ambient air. The
investigator breathes filtered air through the device while they manually adjust the amount of
unfiltered ambient air until the odour is just detectable. This results in a crude field
measurement of odour concentration in dilutions to threshold. Some authorities use
detection requiring more than 7x dilution to indicate unacceptable exposure. Our view is that
this may prove to be useful evidence when assessing how much pollution there is - see Step
1 in Section 3.

Such instruments will be subject to some of the same limitations as sniff testing:

 - olfactory sensitivity of the user;

 - short term adaptation;

 - the need for the tester to be physically present during peak exposures;

 - requires good usage technique;

 - rapidly fluctuating odours may change in the time it takes to carry out the
assessment;

 - users distracted by what is happening around them can sometimes not detect even a
strong smell.

Nevertheless, when used appropriately by competent individuals, the method can provide
more objective results which tend to underestimate the actual exposure. This tendency to
underestimate means that results should normally be interpreted as a minimum odour
concentration level.

**5.5** **Odour diaries and community surveys**

You may recruit community members to take part in monitoring. Designated residents could,
for example, do walk-over surveys (offsite), either on a regular basis or in response to
complaints. Community surveys can give you a useful snapshot of the level of odour
annoyance. Open surveys, where you make it clear what you are trying to achieve, are
easier to design. The responses you get may, though, be vulnerable to bias. It is more
difficult and expensive to design and carry out disguised surveys (in which you try to gather
information about odour impact indirectly). A considerable amount of planning needs to go
into any survey. You need to make sure that the individuals and companies who carry out
your surveys are competent to do so, so that there’s as little bias as possible in the results.

Members of the community could also keep odour diaries (Example templates for odour
diaries and other useful forms are given in Appendix 1). You could ask key individuals, in
strategic locations in the community to keep a diary of times and dates when they detect
smells, to start building up a pattern of odour problems over time, which can then be
associated with other factors such as wind direction and site activities. You shouldn’t expect
individuals to keep such records for a long time. And if you don’t do anything to improve
things, reporting rates will usually fall. But if you ask for and act upon information, you can
improve your relations with key members of the community and have less of an impact on
everyone else.

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 19

Monitoring

You should keep complete and accurate records of any such monitoring.

Community members who gather information on odour may wish to remain anonymous.
Where people are identified the data is more useful but you must comply with the Data
Protection Act, 1998. In particular, you must tell people what the information will be used for
and to whom it may be sent. You can find more details on how to comply with the Data
[Protection Act, 1998 on the Information Commissioner (ICO) website http://www.ico.gov.uk.](http://www.ico.gov.uk/)

**5.6** **Grab samples and dilution olfactometry**

**Dynamic Dilution Olfactometry:** The standard method for measuring odour in Europe is
Dynamic Dilution Olfactometry (BS EN 13725:2003). This involves diluting a grab sample in
the laboratory to a point where each member of the panel can just begin to detect the odour.
The result is the number of dilutions used when half of the panel can detect the odour. So a
dilution detection level of 10,000:1 would be a concentration of 10,000 odour units m [3]
(ouE/m [3] ) (1ouE m [3] = the level of detection under laboratory conditions). This method is only
suitable for concentrated samples, collected at source, which are relatively stable. If you are
testing highly variable emission sources, you will need to ensure that representative samples
are taken. The BS standard provides information on the level of accuracy for the method
which should be considered in these investigations. The use of accredited laboratories and
sampling services is strongly recommended. A minimum of 3 samples are typically required
to assess the variability of results.

Olfactometry (BS EN 13725:2003) is not suitable for measuring odours in an ambient
context. VDI 3940 defines methods by which odour exposure can be measured directly in
the field. A working group CEN WG64/TC27 is currently developing European standard
methods for assessing long term odour exposure in the field, based on the grid method
described in VDI / DIN 3940.

**Hedonic Tone Analysis** is a sensory odour analysis technique that enables the relative
offensiveness or pleasantness of odours to be determined. This technique can provide
useful data for assessing the overall offensiveness of the odour produced by your facility and
thereby assist in deciding the appropriate standard to use in modelling. A standard method
(VDI 3882:1997, Part 2 Determination of Hedonic Tone) has been published by VDI
Germany. See also Appendix 2 and Appendix 3.

**Taking samples**

Many odorous chemicals stick to or react with their surroundings. So you should use nonstick, inert sample containers as suggested in BSEN13725. (e.g. silica-lined steel canisters,
Tedlar bags, etc.). Using the lung principle avoids the degradation of sample in the pump.

You won’t be able to measure odorous chemicals that dissolve into the water phase in a
sample therefore you need to take steps to avoid condensation. The BSEN13725 standard
covers sampling requirements.

**5.7** **Chemical monitoring techniques**
A range of chemical monitoring techniques can be used under some circumstances. For
example:

 - Non-specific instruments (flame ionisation [FID], electrochemical detectors).
Instruments that use a flame ionisation detector will respond to all volatile
hydrocarbons, whether odorous or not. Landfill gas emissions are dominated by

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 20

Monitoring

methane. So the instrument can often still provide a good measure of methane and,
by association, odour. It may also be useful for detecting fugitive emissions - see
below.

 Long path-length monitoring (e.g. LIDAR) also just measures Volatile Organic
Compounds (VOCs). It can, though, be useful for detecting odour sources because it
allows you to take measurements across an emissions plume. Concentrations that
are highly variable over a short period of time (i.e. seconds) probably come from
nearby. More stable concentrations may suggest an emissions point which is further
away. For ground level emissions it should be possible to move the monitor upwind
of the suspected source to assess background levels. Some instruments allow for
the quantitative assessment of dispersed emissions, as well as an assessment of
relative emissions across a large area.

 - Gold foil instruments (e.g. Jerome 631X) can measure extremely low levels of H 2 S
(ppb range). But they may seriously underestimate the overall odour exposure if
organosulphide chemicals (mercaptans) or other odorous chemicals are present.
Hydrogen sulphide instruments based on metal-oxide semiconductors will typically
have sensitivities in the ppm range and so are limited to the assessment of relatively
concentrated odour sources.

 A gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) can, theoretically, be used to give
speciation or a finger print of a particular chemical combination. However, the
chemicals causing the odour are usually minor components so that the results may
not be representative of the odour.

 - Electrochemical detectors (electronic noses) used in arrays can be useful to detect a
change of state in operating conditions as process controls. They are unlikely to be
of value in measuring exposure in ambient air.

Chemical monitoring techniques such as continuous emissions monitoring, analysis of
emissions grab samples and, sometimes, assessments of ambient air, may be useful as
process controls. Where known, the investigator will need to consider the odour threshold of
chemicals being investigated compared with the detection threshold of the analytical method
being used. This is particularly a problem for chemical analysis of highly odorous chemicals
in ambient air where the human nose may be more sensitive than any analytical instruments.

**5.8** **Measuring odour surrogates and process controls**

In a few cases, you will be able to monitor for odour surrogates. For example:

 - odorous chemicals found as part of the mix (e.g. hydrogen sulphide or ammonia);

 - non-odorous chemicals associated with odours (e.g. methane from landfills).

Process measurements, such as pH in a scrubber or anaerobic conditions in a composting
windrow, can be good indications of whether the odour is under control.

With surrogate measurements, the key is that the ratio of surrogate concentration to odour
units must be relatively constant and known. The issues associated with the Jerome
instrument above is a good example of this.

Most of the chemical instrumentation listed above can be used as surrogates - that is they
may be measuring a single substance which is not actually the odorous chemical but is
present in a constant relationship to it.

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 21

Monitoring

**5.9** **Fugitive emissions**

Finding fugitive (including diffuse) emissions can sometimes be quite straightforward, be it
open doors on a waste plant or the spreading of manure on farm land. But it is important that
you don’t focus only on sources that are easy to identify and measure. Don’t ignore sources
that are less obvious, episodic or otherwise inconvenient. Looking for fugitive emissions in a
complex process (e.g. a refinery or chemical plant) requires a detailed knowledge of valves,
flanges and vents, what processes are taking place and what substances are where.

A flame ionisation instrument provides instant readings of hydrocarbons and may be useful in
specific cases. These are where there are significant releases of hydrocarbons, they can be
associated with odorous emissions and there are no other significant sources of
hydrocarbons. You should also consider safety and other practical issues when monitoring.
For example, you probably wouldn’t undertake a leak survey outside when it was windy.
Also, if your survey reveals a leaky valve, for example, you don’t need to quantify the leakyou should just fix it.

If you do need to measure odour concentration, then use a grab sample, followed by dilution
olfactometry. Grab samples will only be suitable for relatively stagnant or stable air
conditions, such as from a stack, enclosed room or flux box.

**Flux boxes** quantify fugitive odour emissions from a surface such as a windrow or pond. A
number of variations are possible. Flux boxes can be open, sealed or purged. The surface
area covered can also vary. There are significant issues to be aware of such as whether the
presence of the box will significantly affect emissions. Area emissions are usually
inconsistent across an emitting surface and over time. For example, emissions between the
top and the bottom of a windrow may differ. Also, fugitive emissions from a landfill may
increase when the barometric pressure is falling, or when there are technical difficulties with
the landfill gas extraction system. Emissions measured over time won’t give the peak
emission rates that we usually look for in odour investigations.

You can find an example of using flux boxes to assess surface emissions in the Environment
Agency Guidance LFTGN 07, _[Guidance on Monitoring Landfill Gas Surface Emissions](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/108918.aspx)_ . As
always, the limitations have to be understood and the results need to be carefully interpreted.

**Tracer gas** techniques may be useful when assessing the integrity of containment features
such as tanks or buildings. The Environment Agency does not promote or condone the use
of SF6 for this purpose as it is an extremely potent greenhouse gas.

**5.10 Monitoring records**

Whatever monitoring you undertake, your records need to include enough information about
the emissions measurement for you to use that data in your analysis. For example, results
for a grab sample analysed by laboratory-based olfactometry must, include:

 - date, time and details of emissions point sampled, and why you chose them;

 - how you preserved the samples (condensation, holding time and conditions);

 - method of sampling (e.g. stack sampling through a 3 metre stainless sampling tube);

 - the laboratory where the results were analysed, and any certification status;

 - any laboratory observations that might affect how you interpret results;

 - process parameters;

 - weather conditions.

**Appendix 1 - Forms**

This appendix provides examples of a report form for sniff testing, a complaint form and an
odour diary. Word versions of these are [available](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/36414.aspx#Horizontal_guidance) [11] .

**Odour reporting form (sniff testing)**

You may need to carry out an assessment either to work out whether you are complying with
your permit, or as a part of an investigation into a complaint.

You can use routine assessments to build up a picture of the impact the odour has on the
surrounding environment over time. You can develop ‘worst case’ scenarios by doing
assessments during adverse weather conditions or during particularly odorous cycles of an
operation. Ideally, you should use the same methodology to follow up complaints.

Please note:

 Staff normally exposed to the odours may not be able to detect or reasonably judge the
intensity of odours off-site. You might be better off using office staff or people who have
not recently been working on the site to do this.

 - Anyone who has a cold, sinusitis or a sore throat, is likely to underestimate the odours.

 - To improve (or to check) data quality, you can get two people to do the test
independently at the same time.

 - Those doing the assessment should avoid strong food or drinks, including coffee, for at
least half an hour beforehand. They should also avoid strongly scented toiletries and
deodorisers in the vehicle used during the assessment.

Where you test will depend on:

 - whether you are responding to a complaint;

 - whether you are checking your state of compliance at sensitive receptors;

 - whether you are trying to establish the source of an odour;

 - wind direction.

The assessment may involve someone walking along a route that you have selected either
because of these factors, or in response to the conditions they found when they got there.
Another option is to choose fixed points so that you can evaluate the changing situation over
several weeks or months. Or the test points may vary from test to test according to local
conditions, which would help you identify worst case conditions.

You should also keep a note of any external activities (such as agricultural practices) that could
be either be the source of the odour, contribute to the odour, or be a confounding factor.
Remember that an odour will become diluted and may change character as this happens.

You should also take the factors given in Section 5.2 Monitoring - Ambient Air into account.

**Appendix 2 - Important odour information**

The information in this appendix is intended to help you understand odour issues and terms. It is
also intended to be useful background for modelling exposure as described in Appendix 3.

**Odour detection thresholds and odour units**

Within any group of people, odour detection thresholds will vary widely. This variation between
people with a healthy sense of smell across a community correlates well with the distribution
shown in Figure A2.1.

**Figure A2.1: Normal range of odour sensitivities**

No. of Individuals

Sensitivity

Odour detection threshold values for individual chemicals are based on the concentration at
which half of a test group can just detect the odour. That is, half of the population should detect
the odour, while the other half does not. Published values may vary widely and should be used
with caution.

Recognition thresholds and annoyance / nuisance etc benchmarks are expressed as multiples of
the odour threshold concentration.

An **odour unit** is a measure of the concentration of a mixture of odorous compounds. It is
determined by means of olfactometry.

Odour unit values are determined by a standard method given in BSEN13725; 2003 on
olfactometry. An odour unit as defined by the CEN standard is 1 ou E . (European Odour Unit)

1 ou E /m [3] is the point of detection.

A rapidly fluctuating odour is often more noticeable than a steady background odour at a low
concentration. People can detect and respond to odour exposure that lasts as little as one or
two seconds.

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 28

**Hedonic scores**

The measurement scale for hedonic tones typically ranges from +4 for very pleasant odours
(bakeries, say) to -4 for foul ones (rotting flesh, for example). Neutral odours score 0 This score
refers to the type of smell, irrespective of its strength (intensity) and can help to decide how
offensive an odour may be.

**Table A2.1: Hedonic scores for everyday odours** **[12]**

|Description|Hedonic<br>Score|
|---|---|
|Bakery (fresh bread)|3.53|
|Coffee|2.33|
|Hay|1.31|
|Raw potato|0.26|
|||
|Rope (hemp)|-0.16|
|Kippery-smoked fish|-0.69|
|Paint|-0.75|
|Mothballs|-1.25|
|Disinfectant, fresh tar|-1.60|
|Wet wool, wet dog|-2.28|

**Adaptation**

Raw potato is about neutral. Even smells that most
people describe as positive and delicious (such as fried
chicken or baking bread) can become annoying to
anyone subjected to them continuously.

The hedonic score of an emission may be altered by
various treatment methods that chemically change
some components to less odorous compounds. Odour
neutralising compounds can work in this way. It may be
possible to achieve this at source for example by dosing
the fluid in an odorous sewer.

Adaptation to odours varies with the odour. People can adapt to individual odours within
fractions of a second. Adaptation also happens in proportion to both the intensity of the odour
and how long someone is exposed to it. The person will begin to recover when they’re no longer
exposed to the odour, or when it is reduced. Both adaptation and recovery tend to occur rapidly
at first, then more slowly as time goes on.

Ground level emissions are dispersed in turbulent air. Concentrations of the odour can vary
widely from second to second. As a result, adaptation does not occur. Your neighbour, that is,
continues to be annoyed about it. Meanwhile your staff, who are constantly exposed to the
odour inside the building, become immune to it.

Long-term adaptation can happen when people are exposed to high levels of specific odours for
a long time. Receptor epithelial cells are normally replaced every 30 to 40 days. It can take
healthy individuals, therefore, this long to regain their sense of smell in these circumstances.

Some chemicals, such as ammonia, result in far less adaptation. People will detect the
emissions for as long as they are exposed to them.

The relevance of adaptation is described in the context of monitoring in Section 5.4 - Sniff
testing.

**A suggested table for characterising odour sources**

Surveying a complex site for odour requires a thorough understanding of what is going on at the
site, and of what odorous materials are held or processed there. The table below may help you
compile information on odour sources.

|Col1|Table A3.2 Odour sources|
|---|---|
|**Parameter**|**Example entries**|

|**Potential for**<br>**problems**|Equipment failures or excessive waste inputs may result in extended holding<br>times for feedstock materials. In bad weather, waste may arrive wet, with<br>anaerobic decay already advanced.|

**Cold drainage flow**

Cold drainage flow occurs on clear, still nights, when cooled air flows downhill. This night-time
surface cooling is what sometimes causes ground frost when ambient air temperatures remain
above freezing. Cold drainage can result in localised ground frost conditions which follow low
lying flow paths.

The flow of surface cooled air can happen on smooth slopes above about one degree through to
rough slopes above five degrees. Drainage flow speeds are typically one or two metres per
second. This can concentrate odour in low-lying places.

This phenomenon will only apply to ground level sources. Stack releases will typically be well
above the layer of cold air stratification. We are not aware of any readily available modelling
packages that might help quantitatively anticipate the impact of cold drainage.

A general awareness of this phenomenon may, though, help explain peculiar patterns of
complaint or suggest what further investigations you might need.

In some countries, wind machines are routinely used to protect crops by disturbing the cold air
near the ground and mixing it with warmer air at higher levels. Theoretically this method or
barriers, such as low lying dense vegetation, may help to manage the flow of cold odorous air at
ground level under cold drainage conditions. The application of these longstanding agricultural
methods to odour dispersion is unproven.

Appendices

**Appendix 3 - Modelling odour exposure**

Modelling be a useful source of predictive information to assess the likely impact of odour. It
is important to give evidence from all predictive methods appropriate weight depending upon
their relevance and reliability in the circumstances of a particular site. A detailed discussion
of how to model exposure is beyond the scope of this guidance. Odour modelling is
specialised enough that only those who have a good technical understanding of modelling
methods and who are familiar with the requirements of the Environment Agency should do it.
They will be able to highlight the inherent uncertainties.

The modelling method commonly used in the UK calculates a 98 [th] percentile of hourly
average odour concentrations over a year. The results are expressed as odour unit contours
on a map. You can check unacceptable levels of odour pollution against exposure
benchmarks. When the results are presented and interpreted, they must take uncertainty
into account, especially in terms of emissions and weather data.

You can use modelling to:

 - predict the impact of a new proposal, comparing with benchmarks;

 - as a tool to assist in the investigation of the cause of odour complaints from existing
facilities and the influence of changing weather conditions on odour dispersion;

 - compare the cost effectiveness of odour mitigation options;

 - work out emission limits for point source emissions, either mg/m [3] for a single odorous
substance or ou E /m [3] for mixtures of substances - we don’t use exposure values at
receptors in your permit because they are almost impossible to measure; in the rare
occasions that they are used, modelling first converts them to emission rates from the
point source - we can then use stack monitoring to check compliance;

 - indicate how much improvement is needed or size abatement equipment;

 - calculate a suitable chimney height to provide an acceptable exposure at receptors.

However, there may be much greater uncertainties associated with odour modelling than
with the modelling of other pollutants for the following reasons:

 - The human nose responds to odour exposure over a 1 to 5 second interval. Average
exposure levels may very well be below the detection threshold but still expose
people to short term concentrations which are much higher. See Appendix 2 ).

 - UK odour benchmark levels are based on research at one particular type of site
under distinct dispersion conditions (e.g. ground level emissions in generally flat
terrain).

Some of these uncertainties are discussed in detail in Science Report: SC030170/SR3,
Review of Dispersion Modelling for Odour Predictions See Bibliography.

**Benchmark levels**

The benchmarks are based on the 98 [th] percentile of hourly average concentrations of odour
modelled over a year at the site/installation boundary. The benchmarks are:

 1.5 odour units for **most offensive** odours;

 3 odour units for **moderately offensive** odours;

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 31

Annexes

 6 odour units for **less offensive** odours.

Any modelled results that project exposures above these benchmark levels, after taking
uncertainty into account, indicates the likelihood of unacceptable odour pollution. You should
also take evidence from other assessment methods and site specific influences into account
when drawing final conclusions.

Referring to Figure 1, these benchmarks represent the intersection of the red and amber
zones. It is still necessary to use appropriate measures/BAT to ensure that odour is
minimised in the amber zone. Where a result is close to the benchmark it suggests that
more is likely to have be done to minimise odours in the amber zone.

Local factors may influence these benchmarks. For example if the local population has
already become sensitised, it may be prudent to reduce the benchmark by say 0.5. If there
are short or infrequent episodes of very high odours that are averaged out by the modelling,
they would need to be considered separately.

The following are indicative examples only and do not have definite cut-off points in terms of
the industry types listed. Although this ranking is based upon the views of a number of
people, there may be individuals who respond differently. It should be noted that:

 it is the odour that matters not the activity;

 this assumes the unmodified odour - the character or offensiveness may be changed
by changing the hedonic score for example by excluding difficult wastes from a
landfill, by pre-treating sludge or by adding a modifying chemical to an odorous air
stream;

 odours from processes likely to become anaerobic or septic are more offensive;

 abatement i.e. reducing the amount of the odorous chemicals released does not
change this score, rather, abatement should enable the operator to meet these
benchmarks;

 the character of odours from different parts of a process may differ - for example it
may only be the sludge handling part of a sewage works that attracts the highest

score;

 the character of an odour can sometimes change with distance;

 Offensiveness also takes into account the sensitivity of the receptor. These figures
are primarily for sensitive receptors such as housing.

**Most offensive**

 - processes involving decaying animal or fish remains

 - processes involving septic effluent or sludge

 - biological landfill odours

**Moderately offensive**

- intensive livestock rearing

- well aerated green waste composting

Most odours from the processes we regulate fall into this category i.e. any odours which do
not obviously fall within the “more offensive” or “less offensive” categories

**Less offensive**

Odour modelling requires good quality assessments of emissions rates (source terms).
Where emissions are inconsistent or are released from non-point sources, these emission
rates can be difficult to assess.

The World Health Organisation [13] (WHO 2000) has produced guideline values for the
avoidance of substantial annoyance for a few single substances as surrogates for overall
odours from specific sources, namely carbon disulphide in viscose emissions, hydrogen
sulphide, styrene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene. You may find these useful as part of a wider
assessment but the values should be used with caution as they are based on a different
averaging method and a different assessment of what is acceptable.

On rare occasions when modelling the odour impact of a single substance you may be able
to find detection thresholds which have been determined by experimentation. Sources of
these threshold values may differ and you should justify the value you decide to use. Then
with a knowledge of whether specific chemicals would be considered highly, moderately or
less offensive, a benchmark concentration can be calculated for these also. So, for example,
methyl methacrylate has a reported detection threshold of 0.38mg/m [3 ] . It is highly offensive
and so it should be modelled to 1.5 odour units (see above). Since 1 odour unit is the
detection threshold, the equivalent concentration is 1.5 x 0.38 = 0.57mg/m [3 ]

The Agency does not favour or prescribe the use of any particular dispersion model. It is left
to operators/applicants to justify their choice of model (including the version). However the
chosen model (and specific version) has to be fit for purpose and based on established
scientific principles. It also needs to have been validated and independently reviewed. For
the purpose of transparency, the Agency expects full technical specifications, validation and
review documents of the chosen model (and the specific version) to be publicly available.

There are two types of dispersion models that meet these requirements and can currently be
used to predict a map of the odour concentration frequency caused by odour emissions:

1. Steady state Gaussian models (e.g. Aermod, ADMS). These general-purpose
models are well established and routinely applied for odour assessments, and
represent a good mathematical approximation of odour plume behaviour when the

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 33

Annexes

odour source is located in relatively simple terrain; where the winds are relatively
evenly distributed; and where the frequency of low wind speeds (< approx 1.5 m/s) is
below 2% for each compass direction.

2. Non-steady state Lagrangian models (e.g. Calpuff and the German regulatory model
Austal). Also known as ‘puff’ models. These models are increasingly being used for
odour assessments purposes and are capable of simulating a wider range of
dispersal conditions than steady state models (e.g. valley channelling, cold drainage,
coastal effects, stagnation, high percentage of low wind speeds or calms). They are
therefore useful for odour assessments at sites which are characterised by such
complex air flow/dispersion conditions.

Non-steady state modelling continues to develop and where an operator wishes to use such
models they should seek the advice of the Environment Agency for the latest position.

Irrespective of the model applied, sufficient information should be supplied to enable the
model to be audited.

A sensitivity analysis, to enable the overall uncertainties to be understood, should also be
provided including:

 likely uncertainties in the source term, including a consideration of fugitive emissions;

 the degree to which the emissions are likely to be steady or fluctuating and the impact
of this on the model chosen;

 likely uncertainties associated with the meteorological data;

 plausible worst case scenarios;

These uncertainties should be acknowledged in consideration of the isopleths.

Once built, the model should be run for different design/what if options in order to show that
BAT/appropriate measures are being proposed and to test the uncertainties.

To represent conditions for an “average year” hourly meteorological data for a period of at
least three, preferably five years should be used. Data can be sourced from the following

sources.

 A representative meteorological station;

 If such a station is not available or the site has specific local features that are likely to
influence dispersion significantly, consideration should be given to the use of site
specific predictive meteorological datasets derived from analysis of synoptic data.
Data of sufficient quality for use in steady state and non steady state models is
available commercially from a number of sources (e.g. TAPM data from the Air
Pollution Model; MM5 data derived from the fifth generation Mesoscale Model)

 Your own weather station if you have one on the site. You should demonstrate that
the siting of this will give a true representation of the conditions of the site.

Annexes

**Appendix 4 - What we are looking for in an odour management plan**

Situations where Odour Management Plans (OMPs) would be required are discussed in
Section 2 of this guidance.

This appendix discusses the purpose of OMPs and outlines the elements we consider to be
essential. Odour management at some sites which have a high potential for odour pollution
can be a major challenge. Accordingly, OMPs for these sites will need to be detailed and
robust. Conversely, sites with a low odour potential will require comparatively simple and
concise OMPs.

**Objectives**

OMPs should be designed to:

 - employ appropriate methods, including monitoring and contingencies, to control and
minimise odour pollution;

 - prevent unacceptable odour pollution at all times;

 - reduce the risk of odour releasing incidents or accidents by anticipating them and
planning accordingly.

All OMPs will need to consider sources, releases and impacts, and use these to identify costeffective opportunities for odour management. For a particular activity, some methods may
be more effective/applicable than others. Sample OMPs, templates or plans produced for
other sites are often helpful starting points.

**Primary odour control measures**

**Source materials**

The OMP must include an inventory, with descriptions and quantities, of all potentially
odorous solid, liquid and gaseous materials held on site across the full range of operating
conditions. These should not be confused with emissions to atmosphere, which are
considered under the Releases heading. Understanding the nature and extent of the stock
of odorous materials held on site is key to recognising and exploiting control opportunities.
Management of these materials may involve total quantity limits or holding conditions
designed to reduce the material’s odour potential. Holding times or conditions for feedstock
materials before they arrive at the site are frequently very important for waste management
activities.

**Releases**

Management of releases includes reducing evaporation and, if needed, containment and
abatement. Where odorous gasses are finally released, controlling the height of release
through a stack or the timing of releases through management of activities can influence
dispersion before there is an impact on people.

**Impacts**

Minimising the impacts of odour pollution requires an understanding of the surrounding
community. What activities are people engaged in and how does this influence their
sensitivity? What is the pattern of these activities over time? How do odours from the site

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 35

Annexes

affect exposed community members and what concerns do they raise? How is the tolerance
of the community towards odour pollution affected by broader perceptions of the company,
the site, the activity or individual employees?

**General**

The best OMPs will include a number of simple measures which each make a significant
contribution to the overall objectives. OMPs which rely on single measures, such as
containment and abatement systems, can be vulnerable to minor failures and may not
provide the most cost effective solution.

Where appropriate, control measures should be backed up by professional engineering
assessments. This is particularly important for complex processes or containment and
abatement systems. Where pollution management depends upon enhanced dispersion, the
choice of measures should normally be backed up with modelling to show the difference
made by the enhancement.

**Monitoring**

All monitoring should clearly relate to the assessment of odour control and complete records
must be kept in an auditable format. Appropriate monitoring must be undertaken for every
stage of process control (i.e. emissions, dispersion and impacts). The interpretation of
monitoring results should be considered in advance and, where appropriate, trigger values
should be specified for contingency measures.

**Process**

The only way to determine whether the processes on site are under control, and to keep
them under control, is to do appropriate monitoring. This may involve sophisticated analysis
used by highly qualified individuals. However, visual assessments or simple measurements
of weights and volumes may be equally important.

For example, monitoring of a composting site should seek to ensure that parameters such as
moisture, texture, oxygen levels and temperature are all within suitable ranges and used to
inform process management decisions. Process monitoring will often need to include
parameters relating to feedstock materials before they even arrive at the site. Factors such
as holding times and conditions can have a profound impact on the odour potential of
feedstock materials. The quantity of material held on site, compared to the capacity limit, is
often a key indicator of whether a composting process is under control and likely to cause
odour problems.

Process monitoring should reflect a thorough understanding of the process in question and
factors which could influence odorous releases.

**Emissions**

As with sources, releases monitoring must provide good evidence that emissions are well
managed and that any control measures are working as intended. Particularly in cases
where emissions are released through one or more vents or stacks, it is often appropriate to
specify performance criteria for any abatement equipment. This may be in the form of odour
units through dilution olfactometry (taking volumes into account) or, where available, suitable
surrogate measurements which can be more easily monitored. The Environment Agency will

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 36

Annexes

normally seek to incorporate these performance criteria into the environmental permit in the
form of Emissions Limit Values (ELVs).

**Dispersion**

Meteorological monitoring can identify when dispersion conditions are poor, or help to
interpret exposure or impact monitoring data. Particular attention should be paid to the
location of instruments. Knowing when dispersion conditions are poor can also inform
decisions to implement additional short-term odour control contingency measures. The OMP
should demonstrate that poor dispersion conditions can be identified and dealt with.

**Exposure / impact**

While complaints are never a substitute for comprehensive process and emissions
monitoring, they are a valuable indicator of offsite odour impact. Procedures should be in
place to receive comments from the community and act upon them. The receipt of a
complaint may be an appropriate trigger for an internal investigation into the efficacy of
current control measures.

Undertaking additional odour observations in the community may be useful, but this must be
well planned and its limitations need to be recognised. People who work on odorous sites
may be uniquely unqualified to undertake this assessment, either because of adaptation or
personal assessments of offensiveness. Also, odours can be highly local and transient.
They may have passed by the time an investigator arrives so the mere failure to confirm the
observation would not alone justify a decision to take no further action.

For sites with ongoing odour problems, it may be beneficial to recruit individuals in the
community to undertake periodic offsite odour surveys or to keep odour diaries. This can be
done either on a voluntary or paid basis.

It is not possible to use instruments to measure odour in ambient air directly. However, very
occasionally it may be possible to undertake surrogate measurements which are indicative of
odours. This may be through direct measurement of chemicals which are themselves
odorous, such as hydrogen sulphide. In other cases, odourless chemicals such as methane
may be associated with odorous emissions of landfill gas.

**Contingency control measures**

Where trigger values have been exceeded or observations indicate odour pollution an
operator will be required to take appropriate contingency measures. These measures may be
aimed at:

 - investigating the pollution incident and its cause(s);

 - bringing the process back under control;

 - temporary or permanent establishment or reinstatement of emissions controls; and/or

 - minimising exposure or annoyance effects.

There are several key factors in preparing for effective contingency management

 - anticipate what might go wrong;

 - consider how problems might be revealed in monitoring;

 - decide how incidents should be managed; and

Environment Agency - How to comply with your permit - H4 Odour Management 37

Annexes

 - make appropriate preparations in advance.

In many cases it is reasonable to expect that the site will experience times when there are
poor dispersion conditions and/or where the community is likely to be more sensitive. Under
these conditions, contingency measures may be used to enhance the performance of
existing controls and additional short-term measures can be used to further control odour
pollution.

Contingencies will need to build upon an understanding of your process, emissions and
dispersion, as already discussed. Where appropriate, we will also expect to see an
escalation of contingency measures where more moderate methods are not successful. This
may involve the use of a backstop contingency measure which results in the temporarily
cessation of relevant activities, such as waste acceptance, until the process and emissions
can be brought back under control.

There should also be a method of determining when contingency measures are no longer
needed.

Repeated or long-term problems will need to be dealt with through more permanent changes
to process controls or abatement measures.

**Incidents and emergencies**

Operators must consider what incidents or emergencies might adversely affect the control of
odour pollution. With this knowledge, they must then plan and take appropriate steps to
reduce the likelihood of the incident occurring, minimise any impacts if the incident were to
occur, and recover control of the process as quickly as possible. This analysis and approach
must all be documented in the OMP.

It is not necessary to consider events which are either very unlikely to occur or where odour
would be a minor element of the overall environmental impact. For example, if there were to
be a major flooding event which affected the site and prevented staff from getting to work,
then odours would be a relatively minor aspect of the overall disruption and environmental
impact.

However, events that are uncommon but reasonably foreseeable which could affect the
running of the site and cause odour problems should be addressed e.g. deliveries may be
affected from time to time or staff (internal and external) may be unavailable for some reason
e.g. illness. The OMP should contain measures to deal with such eventualities. Other
examples of reasonably foreseeable events are on-site breakdowns or loss of process
control.

**Organisation**

Once we have reviewed and approved an OMP an operator will be required to implement it
faithfully. We recommend that operators structure an OMP carefully to ensure that all the
issues highlighted in this guidance are addressed and that the resulting document can be
used effectively and with ease by relevant employees. It effectively forms part of your
environmental management system.

Glossary

**Glossary**

**Adaptation:** The normal desensitisation of individuals to particular odours. See Adaptation in
Appendix 2

**Benchmark Levels:** see Benchmark Levels in Appendix 3

**Bespoke Permits:** A regulated site may not qualify for a Standard Permit, either because it
poses a higher environmental risk, because it cannot work within the limitations imposed by
Standard Permits, or because a Standard Permit is not available for the activity or activities
carried out. If so, we will issue a Bespoke Permit. This is tailored to the individual
circumstances and environmental hazards posed by the site. See also: Standard Permits.

**Cold Drainage Flows:** see Cold Drainage Flow in Appendix 2

**Dynamic Dilution Olfactometry (DDO):** This is based on “dilution to threshold” of a gas
sample containing multiple components. See also BS EN 13725 for a detailed description of
the method. Se section 5.6.

**Detection threshold:** The concentration at which an odorous chemical or mixture can be
just detected. This is usually assessed as an average for populations, because individual
people will have very different sensitivities.

**Enforcement Action:** Enforcement means any action we take where we suspect an offence
has occurred or in some cases is about to occur. This may range from providing advice and
guidance, serving notices through to prosecution, or any combination that best achieves the
[desired outcome. See the enforcement pages](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/regulation/31851.aspx) of our web site.

**Hedonic tone:** The generally accepted degree of pleasantness or unpleasantness
(offensiveness) for a particular odour. ISO 5492. See Appendices 2 and 3.

**Intensity:** An assessment of odour strength based on an initial perception. This perception
strength will rapidly diminish with constant exposure. The relationship between odour
intensity and odour concentration depends on the specific intensity of the chemical or mixture
being detected. Assessments can be made using the German method VDI 3882. See
Section 2.

**Isopleth:** A line on a map connecting places registering the same amount or ratio of some
geographical or meteorological phenomenon or phenomena. Commonly used to illustrate
the output of odour models.

**Long path-length monitoring (e.g. Boreal Laser)** can measure Volatile Organic
Compounds (VOCs) or a limited range of individual chemicals. See Chemical Monitoring.
See bibliography entry for ‘Measurement of Fugitive Emissions at a Landfill.

**Odorous materials / substances / wastes:** Materials that contain and have the potential to
emit volatile odorous chemicals.

**Offensiveness:** See Section 3

**Olfactory fatigue:** Often confused with adaptation, this phenomenon is believed to be
exclusively associated with exposure to H2S. At a concentration of about 100ppm, the H2S

Glossary

causes rapid paralysis of nerves in the nose. This results in complete but temporary loss of
smell.

**OMP:** Odour Management Plan.

**Pollution:** See definition and reference in Section 3.

**Recognition Threshold:** The concentration at which an odour can be identified. This is
typically several times the detection threshold.

**Source Term:** This is the quantity of emissions being released from a source. Units for the
purposes of odour will typically be (odour units * cubic metres / sec).

**Standard Permit:** A type of permit issued under the Environmental Permitting Regulations
containing standard rules for defined activities. The permit cannot be tailored to site specific
requirements.

**Tedlar Bags:** These are manufactured from Polyvinyl fluoride PVF (Tedlar) film. They are
generally inert and can be used to collect samples containing common solvents,
hydrocarbons, chlorinated solvents, and many other classes of compounds. They are
commonly used to collect low-level sulphur gases, but only if the bag fittings are non-metallic
(polypropylene, Teflon, or Nylon). Sample hold time will vary for different classes of
compounds
