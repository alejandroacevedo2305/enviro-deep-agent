Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

## Chapter 1

**Introduction And Background**

This manual provides practical guidance to Caltrans engineers, planners,
and consultants who must address vibration issues associated with the

construction, operation, and maintenance of California Department of
Transportation (Caltrans) projects.

Operation of construction equipment and construction techniques such as
blasting generate ground vibration. Maintenance operations and traffic
traveling on roadways can also be a source of such vibration. If its
amplitudes are high enough, ground vibration has the potential to damage
structures, cause cosmetic damage (e.g., crack plaster), or disrupt the
operation of vibration-sensitive equipment such as electron microscopes
and advanced technology production and research equipment. Ground
vibration and groundborne noise can also be a source of annoyance to
individuals who live or work close to vibration-generating activities. Pile
driving, demolition activity, blasting, and crack-and-seat operations are
the primary sources of vibration addressed by Caltrans. Traffic, including
heavy trucks traveling on a highway, rarely generates vibration amplitudes
high enough to cause structural or cosmetic damage. However, there have
been cases in which heavy trucks traveling over potholes or other
discontinuities in the pavement have caused vibration high enough to
result in complaints from nearby residents. These types of issues typically
can be resolved by smoothing the roadway surface.

Freight trains, mass-transit trains, and light-rail trains can also be
significant sources of ground vibration and groundborne noise in the
environment. Caltrans is usually not involved in the construction of rail
projects. There are, however, instances in which construction or
modification of a roadway requires the relocation of existing rail lines. In
these cases, Caltrans must consider the effects on ground vibration
associated with relocated existing tracks.

The guidance and procedures provided in this manual should be treated as
screening tools for assessing the potential for adverse effects related to
human perception and structural damage. General information on the
potential effects of vibration on vibration-sensitive research and advanced
technology facilities is also provided, but a discussion of detailed

assessment methods in this area is beyond the scope of this manual. Most
situations involving research and advanced technology facilities will
require consultation with experts with specialized expertise in this area.

The information in this manual is meant to be informative and educational

to those individuals who must address vibration from construction

equipment, explosives, and facility operations. As such, the information
presented herein is considered both reliable and accurate. However,
because the authors have no control over the conditions under which the

information might be used, any and all risk associated with the use of the
information contained herein lies with the user of this manual. This

document is not an official policy, standard, specification, or regulation
and should not be used as such. Its content is for informational purposes
only.

This manual does not supersede previous Caltrans publications on
earthborne vibration. Rather, it is intended to supplement previous
publications and to improve knowledge and information related to this
issue. Caltrans has been involved in the evaluation of earthborne vibration

since 1958 and has conducted numerous studies since that time. A
Caltrans report titled _Survey of Earth-borne Vibrations due to Highway_
_Construction and Highway Traffic_ (Report CA-DOT-TL-6391-1-76-20)
compiled a summary of results, findings, and conclusions of 23 studies
completed in the 17-year period between 1958 and 1975. A Caltrans
technical advisory titled _Transportation Related Earthborne Vibrations_
_(Caltrans Experiences)_ (Technical Advisory TAV-02-01-R9601) that was
prepared in 1996 and updated in 2002 provides information from these 23
studies and other Caltrans vibration studies. This technical advisory is
provided in Appendix A.

The following is an overview of the information presented in this manual.
Because of the unique nature and effects of blasting, a separate chapter on
that topic is presented.

 - **Chapter 1, “Introduction and Background,”** summarizes the layout

of this manual and provides background information on groundborne
vibration.

 - **Chapter 2, “Basic Physics of Ground Vibration,”** discusses the

basic physics of groundborne vibration.

 - **Chapter 3, “Vibration Sources,”** discusses the various sources of

groundborne vibration that are of concern to Caltrans.

 - **Chapter 4, “Vibration Propagation,”** discusses groundborne

vibration wave types and vibration propagation models.

## Chapter 2

**Basic Physics of Ground Vibration**

### 2.1 Simple Vibratory Motion

Dynamic excitation of an elastic system, such as the ground or a structure,
results in movement of the particles that compose the elastic system. An
idealized system of lumped parameters is commonly used to describe and
evaluate the response of the elastic or vibratory system to excitation. The
simplest lumped parameter system is called a “single-degree of freedom
system with viscous damping.” This system comprises a mass (to
represent the weight of the system), a spring (to represent the elasticity of
the system), and a dashpot (to represent damping in the system). Figure 1
is graphic representation of this idealized system.

The following equation, which excludes the effects of damping, can be
used to describe the vibratory motion of a mass in this simple system:

_D = D_ _pk_ _sin (2_  _ft)_ _(Eq. 1.)_

Where:

_D = displacement from the at-rest position at a given point in time_

_D_ _pk_ _= maximum or peak displacement amplitude from the at-rest_
_position_

 _= ~3.1416_

_f = rate of oscillation expressed in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz)_

_t = time in seconds [sec.]_

Figure 2 depicts the quantities that are used to describe the vibratory
motion.

As the mass oscillates up and down past the at-rest position, the motion
can be described as follows. When the mass is at the maximum point of
displacement with the spring either compressed or extended, the velocity

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 2: Basics of Ground Vibration

of the mass is zero and the acceleration of the mass is at a maximum.

Conversely, as the mass passes through the point of zero displacement, the
velocity is at a maximum and the acceleration is zero.

The velocity (V) of the mass can be determined by taking the time
derivative of the displacement, which is equivalent to multiplying the
displacement by 2  f:

_V = 2_  _f x D_ _(Eq. 2)_

The acceleration (A) of the mass can be determined by taking the second
time derivative of displacement, or the time derivative of the velocity:

_A = 2_  _f x V = (2_  _f)_ _[2]_ _x D_ _(Eq. 3)_

Therefore, if the frequency and amplitude of displacement, velocity, or
acceleration are known, the remaining amplitudes can be determined by
differentiation or integration. For example, if the frequency and amplitude
of velocity are known, the displacement amplitudes can be determined by
### integration (dividing by 2  f) and the acceleration amplitude can be

determined by differentiation (multiplying by 2  f).

### 2.2 Amplitude Descriptors

In describing vibration in the ground and in structures, the motion of a
particle (i.e., a point in or on the ground or structure) is used. The concepts
of particle displacement, velocity, and acceleration are used to describe
how the ground or structure responds to excitation. Although displacement
is generally easier to understand than velocity or acceleration, it is rarely
used to describe ground and structureborne vibration because most
transducers used to measure vibration directly measure velocity or
acceleration, not displacement. Accordingly, vibratory motion is
commonly described by identifying the peak particle velocity (PPV) or
peak particle acceleration (PPA). This is the zero-to-peak amplitude
indicated in Figure 2.

PPV is generally accepted as the most appropriate descriptor for
evaluating the potential for building damage. For human response,
however, an average vibration amplitude is more appropriate because it
takes time for the human body to respond to the excitation (the human
body responds to an average vibration amplitude, not a peak amplitude).
Because the average particle velocity over time is zero, the root-meansquare (rms) amplitude is typically used to assess human response. The

rms value is the average of the amplitude squared over time, typically a 1sec. period (Federal Transit Administration 2006). The rms value is
always positive and always less than PPV; for a single frequency
condition, the rms value is about 70% of the PPV. The rms amplitude is
indicated in Figure 2. The crest factor is the ratio of the peak amplitude to
the rms amplitude. For a sine wave, the crest factor is 1.414. For random
ground vibration such as vibration from trains, the crest factor is 4. For
vibration from pile driving and other impact sources, the crest factor
cannot be readily defined because it depends on the averaging time of the

rms measurement.

Displacement is typically measured in inches (in.) or millimeters (mm).
Velocity is measured in inches per second (in/sec) or millimeters per
second (mm/sec). Acceleration is measured in in/sec per second (in/sec [2] ),
mm/sec per second (mm/sec [2] ), or relative to the acceleration of gravity (g)
(32.2 feet [ft.]/sec [2] or 9.8 meters [m]/sec [2] ).

Decibels (dB) are also commonly used to compress the range of numbers
required to describe vibration. Vibration velocity level (L v ) in dB is
defined as follows (Federal Transit Administration 1995).

_L_ _v_ _= 20 x log_ _10_ _(v/v_ _ref_ _)_ _(Eq. 4)_

Where:

_L_ _v_ _= velocity level in decibels (VdB)_

_v = rms velocity amplitude_

_v_ _ref_ _= reference velocity amplitude_

In the United States, v ref is usually 1 x 10 [-6] in/sec (1 μ-in/sec). For
example, an rms value of 0.0018 in/sec is equal to a vibration velocity
level of 65 VdB (re: 1 μ-in/sec). In this manual, all vibration velocity dB
values are expressed relative to 1 u-in/sec rms. Vibration in terms of PPV
is referred to as vibration velocity amplitude, whereas vibrations in terms
of VdB is referred to as vibration velocity level.

When discussing vibration amplitude, the direction of the particle motion
must be considered. Vibration amplitude can be described in terms a
vertical component; a horizontal longitudinal component; a horizontal
transverse component; and the resultant, which is the vector sum of the
horizontal and vertical components. Caltrans most often uses a vertical
PPV descriptor because vibration amplitude along the ground surface is
usually, but not always, greatest in the vertical direction (Hendriks 2002).
More importantly, the vertical component is usually representative of the
vibration in all three orthogonal directions and is most easily measured.

In addition to the three translational axes discussed above, particle motion
can also be rotational or angular along three rotational axes. Rotational
particle motion is generally not a concern with regard to human or
structure response. However, certain semiconductor tools, radar antennas,
and telescopes are sensitive to rotational vibration. A detailed discussion
of rotational particle motion is beyond the scope of this manual.

**Vibration Sources**

The duration and amplitude of vibration generated by construction and
maintenance equipment varies widely depending on the type of equipment
and the purpose for which it is being used. The vibration from blasting has
a high amplitude and short duration, whereas vibration from grading is
lower in amplitude but longer in duration. In assessing vibration from
construction and maintenance equipment, it is useful to categorize the
equipment by the nature of the vibration generated. Various equipment
categories according to type of vibration and/or activities in each category
are discussed below.

Equipment or activities typical of continuous vibration include:

 - excavation equipment,

 - static compaction equipment,

 - tracked vehicles,

 - traffic on a highway,

 - vibratory pile drivers,

 - pile-extraction equipment, and

 - vibratory compaction equipment.

Equipment or activities typical of single-impact (transient) or low-rate
repeated impact vibration include:

 - impact pile drivers,

 - blasting,

 - drop balls,

 - “pogo stick” compactors, and

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 3: Vibration Sources

 - crack-and-seat equipment.

Equipment typical of high-rate repeated impact vibration includes
jackhammers and pavement breakers.

Because vehicles traveling on highway are supported on flexible
suspension systems and pneumatic tires, these vehicles are not an efficient
source of ground vibration. They can, however, impart vibration into the
ground when they roll over pavement that is not smooth. Continuous
traffic traveling on a smooth highway creates a fairly continuous but
relatively low level of vibration. Where discontinuities exist in the
pavement, heavy truck passages can be the primary source of localized,
intermittent vibration peaks. These peaks typically last no more than a few
seconds and often for only a fraction of a second. Because vibration drops
off rapidly with distance, there is rarely a cumulative increase in ground
vibration from the presence of multiple trucks. In general, more trucks
result in more vibration peaks, though not necessarily higher peaks.
Automobile traffic normally generates vibration amplitudes that are onefifth to one-tenth the amplitude of truck vibration amplitudes.
Accordingly, ground vibration generated by automobile traffic is usually
overshadowed by vibration from heavy trucks.

Freight trains, commuter rail trains, mass-transit trains, and light-rail trains
can also be significant sources of ground vibration in the environment.
Although Caltrans is usually not involved in the construction of rail
projects, there are instances in which construction or modification of a
roadway requires the relocation or existing rail lines. In these cases,
Caltrans must consider the effects on ground vibration associated with
relocated existing tracks. Factors that affect the amount of vibration
generated by a train include:

 - stiffness of the vehicle suspension systems,

 - unsprung mass of the wheel sets and trucks,

 - roundness of the wheels,

 - roughness of the rails and wheels,

 - rail support system,

 - mass and stiffness of the guideway structure, and

 - stiffness and layering of soils supporting the rails.

**Vibration Propagation**

### 4.1 Vibration Wave Types

When the ground is subject to vibratory excitation from a vibratory source,
a disturbance propagates away from the vibration source. The ground
vibration waves created are similar to those that propagate in water when a
stone is dropped into the water. To assess ground vibration propagation
over distance, the ground is modeled as an infinite elastic halfspace. The
body of this type of medium can sustain two types of waves:
“compression” or “primary” waves (P-waves), and “secondary” or “shear”
waves (S-waves). These waves are called “body waves.” The particle
motion associated with a P-wave is a push-pull motion parallel to the
direction of the wave front, whereas particle motion associated with an Swave is a transverse displacement normal to the direction of the wave
front.

In 1885, Lord Rayleigh discovered a third type of wave that can propagate
in a halfspace. The motion of this wave, called a Rayleigh wave (R-wave),
is confined to a zone near the surface or boundary of the halfspace. The Rwave consists of horizontal and vertical components that attenuate rapidly
with depth (Richart 1970). Figure 3 depicts the deformation characteristics
of P-, S-, and R-waves.

P-, S-, and R-waves travel at different speeds. The P-wave is the fastest,
followed by the S-wave, then the R-wave. For a single short-duration
disturbance, the characteristic wave system is shown in Figure 4 (Richart
1970). About 67% of energy is transmitted in the R-wave, 26% in the Swave, and 7% in the P-wave (Richart 1970). As shown in Figure 5, the Pwave arrives first, followed by the S-wave, then the R-wave, with most of
the energy in the R-wave. Along the surface of the ground, the P- and Swaves decay more rapidly than the R-wave. Therefore, the R-wave is the
most significant disturbance along the surface of the ground, and it may be
the only clearly distinguishable wave at large distances from the source
(Richart 1970). However, at higher frequencies the R-wave may not be
identifiable because inhomogeneities and layering complicate the
propagation of these waves.

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 4: Vibration Propagation

### 4.2 Vibration Propagation Models

When the ground is subject to vibratory excitation, body waves propagate
outward radially from the source along a hemispherical wave front, while
the R-wave propagates outward radially along a cylindrical wave front.
All of these waves encounter an increasingly large volume of material as
they travel outward, and the energy density in each wave decreases with
distance from the source. This decrease in energy density and the
associated decrease in displacement amplitude is called spreading loss.
The amplitudes of body waves decrease in direct proportion to the
distance from the source, except along the surface, where their amplitudes
decrease in direct proportion to square of the distance to the source. The
amplitude of R-waves decreases in direct proportion to the square root of
the distance from the source.

The general equation for modeling spreading loss (often called “geometric
attenuation”) is as follows:

_v_ _b_ _= v_ _a_ _(r_ _a_ _/r_ _b_ _)_ [] _(Eq. 5)_

Where:

_v_ _a_ _= vibration amplitude of the source at distance r_ _a_

_v_ _b_ _= vibration amplitude at distance r_ _b_

 _= geometric attenuation coefficient_

As implied above, the geometric attenuation exponent depends on the
wave type and propagation path. Table 1 summarizes the geometric
attenuation coefficient by wave type and propagation path.

Table 1. Geometric Attenuation Coefficients

Source: Amick 2000.

Given that two-thirds of the total input energy is transmitted away from a
vertically oscillating source by the R-wave and that the R-wave decays
much more slowly with distance than body waves, the R-wave is of
primary concern for foundations on or near the ground surface (Richart
1970). Most construction settings involve surface or near-surface sources

and receivers, making the R-wave the primary wave of concern. Even
when the actual vibration source is below the surface, as with pile driving,
R-waves are formed within a few meters of the point on the surface
directly above the source (Dowding 1996). Accordingly, propagation of
vibration from construction sources, including pile driving, is typically
modeled in terms of R-waves (i.e.,  = 0.5). For a buried source, the Rwave emerges at a distance of about five times the depth from the source.

Because soil is not perfectly elastic, another attenuation factor influences
attenuation of R-waves. In real earth materials, energy is lost by material
damping (Richart 1970). Material damping is generally thought to be
attributable to energy loss due to internal sliding of soil particles. Fluid
motion in pores may also produce attenuation. Assuming R-waves are of
primary consideration, the effect of material damping can be added to Eq.
5 as follows (Richart 1970):

_v_ _b_ _= v_ _a_ _(r_ _a_ _/r_ _b_ _)_ _[0.5 ]_ _e_ _[ a(ra - rb) ]_ _(Eq. 6)_

Where:

 _= material damping coefficient_

Many factors affect material damping in soil, including soil type, moisture
content, temperature, and the frequency of the vibration sources. Clays
tend to exhibit higher damping than sandy soils (Wiss 1967). Wet sand
attenuates less than dry sand because the combination of pore water and
sand particles in wet sand does not subject compressional waves to as
much attenuation by friction damping as does dry sand. Propagation of Rwaves is moderately affected by the presence or absence of water (Richart
1970). Frozen soil attenuates less than thawed soil (Barkan 1962). Table 2
summarizes material damping coefficients for various soil types.

California Department of Transportation Chapter 4: Vibration Propagation

Table 2. Summary of Material-Damping Coefficients (Applies to Both P- and S-Waves)

Sources: Amick 2000, Hendriks 2002 (for Hendricks only).

A more simplified model has been suggested by Wiss (1981), who
obtained a best fit of field data with the following equation:

_V = kD_ _[-n ]_ _(Eq. 7)_

Where:

_V = PPV of the seismic wave_

_k = value of velocity at one unit of distance_

_D = distance from the vibration source_

_n = slope or attenuation rate_

The “n” value in this case is not equivalent to the material damping
coefficient, but rather is a composite value or pseudo-attenuation
coefficient that accounts for both geometric and material damping. Woods
and Jedele (1985) developed values for “n” from field construction data.
These values were related to generic soil types as indicated in Table 3.

Table 3. “n” Values Based on Soil Classes

There is a relationship between vibration amplitude and the energy of the
driving force (Hendriks 2002). In general, if the energy of the driving
force changes from E 1 to E 2, the vibration amplitude changes from V 1 to
V 2 according to the following equation:

_V_ _2_ _= V_ _1_ _(E_ _2_ _/E_ _1_ _)_ _[0.5]_ _(Eq. 8)_

In general, if the vibration amplitude of a source at a given distance is
known, Eq. 6 or Eq. 7 can be used to estimate the resulting amplitude at
various distances. This methodology, which does not account for the
frequency dependence of the material-damping coefficient, provides a
convenient and reasonable means of assessing vibration impact on
structures and people. This method does not, however, have enough detail
to be particularly useful for impact assessment for vibration-sensitive
research or advanced technology facilities (Amick 2000). There is a
significant body of knowledge that relates human response and building
damage to the peak velocity amplitude measured in the time domain.
Essentially, this is the function of Eq. 6 and Eq. 7. However, most
assessment of the impact of vibration on research and advanced
technology facilities is based on measurement and analysis in the
frequency domain using frequency spectra (typically one-third octave
spectra). The assessment of frequency-dependent vibration propagation is
beyond the scope of this guidance manual.

For the purposes of assessing vibration effects on people and structures,
use of a frequency- independent material-damping coefficient is supported
by the fact that damage levels in terms of velocity in the frequency range
of 1-80 Hz tend to be independent of frequency. This is also true for
complaint levels in a frequency range of 8-80 Hz. Typical vibration from
transportation and construction sources typically falls in the range of 1030 Hz and usually centers around 15 Hz (Hendriks 2002). Within the

narrow range of frequencies associated with most sources, frequency
independence is a reasonable assumption.

Chapter 7 discusses a suggested method for applying propagation models
to the assessment of groundborne vibration from construction equipment.
Chapter 8 discusses a method relating to blasting.

**Vibration Receivers**

There are three primary types of receivers that can be adversely affected
by ground vibration: people, structures, and equipment.

Ground vibration can be annoying to people. The primary effect of
perceptible vibration is often a concern. However, secondary effects, such
as the rattling of a china cabinet, can also occur, even when vibration
levels are well below perception. Any effect (primary perceptible
vibration, secondary effects, or a combination of the two) can lead to
annoyance. The degree to which a person is annoyed depends on the
activity in which they are participating at the time of the disturbance. For
example, someone sleeping or reading will be more sensitive than
someone who is running on a treadmill. Reoccurring primary and
secondary vibration effects often lead people to believe that the vibration
is damaging their home, although vibration levels are well below
minimum thresholds for damage potential.

Vibration generated by construction activity has the potential to damage
structures. This damage could be structural damage, such as cracking of
floor slabs, foundations, columns, beams, or wells, or cosmetic
architectural damage, such as cracked plaster, stucco, or tile.

Ground vibration also has the potential to disrupt the operation of
vibration-sensitive research and advanced technology equipment. This
equipment can include optical microscopes, cell probing devices, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) machines, scanning electron microscopes,
photolithography equipment, micro-lathes, and precision milling
equipment. The degree to which this equipment is disturbed depends on
the type of equipment, how it used, and its support structure. For example,
equipment supported on suspended floors may be more susceptible to
disturbance than equipment supported by an on-grade slab.

**Vibration Criteria**

Over the years, numerous vibration criteria and standards have been
suggested by researchers, organizations, and governmental agencies.
There are no Caltrans or Federal Highway Administration standards for
vibration, and it is not the purpose of this manual to set standards. Rather,
the following discussion provides a summary of vibration criteria that
have been reported by various researchers, organizations, and
governmental agencies. The information is used in this chapter to develop
a synthesis of these criteria that can be used to evaluate the potential for
damage and annoyance from vibration-generating activities. In addition to
the criteria discussed in this chapter, additional criteria that apply
specifically to blasting are provided in Chapter 11.

### 6.1 People

Numerous studies have been conducted to characterize the human
response to vibration. Table 4 summarizes the results of an early study
(Reiher 1931) on human response to steady-state (continuous) vibration.
Human response to vibration generated by blasting is discussed in Chapter
8.

Table 4. Human Response to Steady State Vibration

Table 5 summarizes the results of another study (Whiffen 1971) that
relates human response to vibration from traffic (continuous vibration).

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 6: Vibration Criteria

Table 5. Human Response to Continuous Vibration from Traffic

Table 6 summarizes the results of another study (Wiss 1974) that relates
human response to transient vibration.

Table 6. Human Response to Transient Vibration

The results in Tables 4-6 suggest that the thresholds for perception and
annoyance are higher for transient vibration than for continuous vibration.

In 1981, the International Standards Organization (ISO) published _Guide_
_to the Evaluation of Human Exposure to Vibration and Shock in Buildings_
_(1 Hz to 80 Hz)_ (ISO 2631). This document, based on the work of many
researchers, suggested that humans are sensitive to particle velocity in the
range of 8-80 Hz. This means that the same velocity at different discrete
frequencies will elicit the same response, such as detection or discomfort.
Below 8 Hz, the body is less sensitive to vibration, and therefore responds
more uniformly to acceleration (i.e., higher velocities are needed to elicit
the same response). Table 7 summarizes the vibration criteria in ISO 2631
for vibration sources with predominant frequencies in the range of 8-80
Hz. It is recommended in ISO 2631 that one-third octave band filtering be
used when the vibration source has many closely spaced frequencies or
contains broadband energy.

Table 7. ISO 2631 Vibration Criteria

Also, FTA (2006) has developed vibration criteria based on building use.
These criteria, shown in Table 8, are based on overall rms vibration levels
expressed in VdB.

Table 8. Federal Transit Administration Vibration Impact Criteria

Note: “Frequent events” is defined as more than 70 events per day. “Infrequent events” is defined as fewer than 70

events per day.

### 6.2 Structures

The effects of vibration on structures has also been the subject of
extensive research. Much of this work originated in the mining industry,
where vibration from blasting is a critical issue. The following is a
discussion of damage thresholds that have been developed over the years.
Mining industry standards relating to structure damage thresholds are
presented in Chapter 7.

A study by Chae (1978) classifies buildings in one of four categories
based on age and condition. Table 9 summarizes maximum blast vibration
amplitudes based on building type. (The study recommends that the
categories be lowered by one if the structure is subject to repeated
blasting.)

Table 9. Chae Building Vibration Criteria

The Swiss Association of Standardization has developed a series of
vibration damage criteria that differentiates between single-event sources
(blasting) and continuous sources (machines and traffic) (Wiss 1981). The

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

criteria are also differentiated by frequency. Assuming that the frequency
range of interest for construction and traffic sources is 10-30 Hz, Table 10
shows criteria for 10-30 Hz.

Table 10. Swiss Association of Standardization Vibration Damage Criteria

Konan (1985) reviewed numerous vibration criteria relating to historic and
sensitive buildings, and developed a recommended set of vibration criteria
for transient (single-event) and steady-state (continuous) sources. Konan
recommended that criteria for continuous vibration be about half the

amplitude of criteria for transient sources. Table 11 summarizes the
recommended criteria.

Table 11. Konan Vibration Criteria for Historic and Sensitive Buildings

Whiffen (1971) presents additional criteria for continuous vibration. These
criteria are summarized in Table 12.

Siskind et al. (1980) applied probabilistic methods to vibration damage
thresholds for blasting. Three damage thresholds have been identified and
are described in Table 13 in terms of PPV for probabilities of 5, 10, 50,
and 90%.

Dowding (1996) suggests maximum allowable PPV for various structure
types and conditions. Table 14 summarizes these values.

damage to structures from intermittent construction or maintenance
activities. Table 15 summarizes the AASHTO maximum levels.

building along with information from a survey of state departments of
transportation on the topic. The report also provides a suggested guideline
approach to assessing these effects. The report can be found at the
following NCHRP website:

### 6.3 Equipment

The operation of equipment for research, microelectronics manufacturing,
medical diagnostics, and similar activities can be adversely affected by
vibration. For the purposes of designing facilities to house this equipment,
vibration criteria that are generic (i.e., applicable to classes of equipment
or activity) rather than specific have been developed (Amick et al. 2005).
These criteria are expressed in terms of one-third octave band velocity
spectra and are summarized in Table 16.

**Vibration Prediction and Screening Assessment**

**for Construction Equipment**

To assess the potential for vibration to annoy people and damage
structures, a reasonable means must be available for estimating or
predicting the PPV from various sources at various distances. This section
describes a simple method for predicting vibration amplitudes from
construction equipment, in terms of PPV, for a variety of vibration sources
and soil types. A method for evaluating vibration from blasting is provided
in Chapter 8. The evaluation of potential vibration impacts on research and
advanced technology production equipment is beyond the scope of this
manual. Individuals with specialized expertise in the evaluation of these
impacts should be contacted in cases where research and advanced
technology equipment could be affected.

This assessment of effects relates to the direct effects of vibration on
people and structures. For pile driving, there are few cases of direct
damage to structures located farther from a pile than the length of that pile.
Settlement of soil as the result of pile driving, however, has potential to
damage surface and buried structures at greater distances. Assessment of
effects related to vibration-related soil settlement is beyond the scope of
this manual. Individuals with specialized expertise in vibration-related soil
settlement should be consulted in cases where construction-induced

vibration could result in soil settlement or liquefaction.

The method presented in this chapter uses reference vibration source
amplitudes and the simplified Wiss propagation model (Eq. 7) described
in Chapter 4. The following discussion is separated into the following
equipment categories: pile drivers, hydraulic breakers, and other
construction equipment. Vibration amplitudes estimated using the method
presented in this chapter are expected to be _typical worst-case values_ and
should be viewed as guidelines only. Actual values from equipment used
by a contractor may result in vibration amplitudes that exceed or are lower
than the estimated values.

Assessment for Construction Equipment

### 7.1 Pile Driving Equipment

A wide variety of impact and vibratory pile driving hammers is used for
driving or extracting various types of piles. Commonly used types of pile
drivers are described below.

 - **Drop hammer:** The simplest form of pile driving hammer is a falling

weight called a gravity or drop hammer. In this case, a weight is raised
to the desired height by an attached crane hoist line and dropped
directly or indirectly onto the pile. The weight can be enclosed in a
steel cylinder.

 - **Pneumatic hammer:** A pneumatic impact hammer, also called a

compressed-air hammer, is essentially a drop hammer in which a
ram/piston in a cylinder is propelled upward by compressed air. The
ram strikes the pile cap at the end of a downward stroke, which may be
in a free fall under gravity (single-acting) or assisted in downward
stroke by pressurized air over the piston head to accelerate the ram
(double-acting).

 - **Diesel hammer:** Diesel impact hammers are similar to pneumatic

hammers. However, whereas pneumatic hammers are one-cylinder
drivers that require compressed air from an external source, diesel
hammers carry their own fuel, from which they generate their power
internally. The falling ram compresses the air in the cylinder, and the
impact atomizes a pool of diesel fuel at the end of the cylinder. The
atomized fuel ignites with the compressed air and propels the ram
upward, ready for the next downward stroke. The burnt gases are
scavenged from the cylinder on the upward stroke of the ram. Some
diesel hammers are provided with an adjustable fuel pump that serves
to regulate the jumping height, and thereby the impact energy.

 - **Hydraulic hammer:** Hydraulic impact hammers are a relatively new

type of hammer. They are similar to the pneumatic impact hammers,
except that the ram is lifted hydraulically, using an external hydraulic
source, and then is left to fall freely or is accelerated downward by
pressurized gas above the piston.

 - **Vibratory pile driver:** Vibratory pile drivers advance the pile by

vibrating it into the ground. They are especially effective for soils that
are vibratorily mobile, such as sands and silts. Vibration is created in
the gear case by rotating eccentric weights powered by hydraulic
motors, and sometimes by electric motors. Only vertical vibration is
created in the gear case. Horizontal vibration is canceled by the paired
eccentrics, which are interconnected with gears to maintain

synchronization. The vibration created in the gear case is transmitted
into the pile being driven or extracted by means of a hydraulic clamp
attached to the bottom of the gear case. The complete vibrator
assembly is held by crane. To prevent the vibration created in the gear
case from affecting the crane line, a vibration suppresser assembly is
attached to the top of the gear case.

The rated energies of most pile drivers are in the range of about 20,000300,000 foot-pounds (ft-lbs.) (Woods 1997). One very large driver, the
Vulcan 6300, has a rated energy of 1,800,000 ft-lbs. Smaller drivers have
rated energies as low as 300 ft-lbs. (Woods 1997.)

#### 7.1.1 Vibration Amplitudes Produced by Impact

**Pile Drivers**

An extensive review of the available literature (Martin 1980; Wood and
Theissen 1982; Wiss 1967, 1974, 1981; Dowding 1996; Federal Transit
Administration 1995; Woods 1997; Schexnayder and Ernzen 1999) and
information provided by the manufacturers (Preston 2002; Morris 1991,
1996, 1997) indicates that the PPV from impact pile drivers can be
estimated by the following equation:

_PPV_ _Impact Pile Driver_ _= PPV_ _Ref_ _(25/D)_ _[n ]_ _x (E_ _equip_ _/E_ _Ref_ _)_ _[0.5 ]_ _(in/sec) (Eq. 9)_

Where:

_PPV_ _Ref_ _= 0.65 in/sec for a reference pile driver at 25 ft._

_D = distance from pile driver to the receiver in ft._

_n = 1.1 is a value related to the vibration attenuation rate through_
_ground_

_E_ _Ref_ _= 36,000 ft-lb (rated energy of reference pile driver)_

_E_
_equip_

_= rated energy of impact pile driver in ft-lbs._

The above equation is based on extensive review of the actual data points
at various distances, measured for a wide range of impact pile drivers. The
data were measured at the ground surface outside or within various types
of buildings.

Literature indicates that the value of “n” in the above equation is generally
1 to 1.5. The suggested value for n is 1.1. The use of values greater than

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

Assessment for Construction Equipment

1.1 would likely result in overestimation of amplitudes at distances closer
than 25 ft and would be slightly conservative at distances beyond 25 ft.

If vibration impacts, based on the above approach, are expected to exceed
the vibration assessment criteria, vibration estimates may be refined
further by using values of “n” that are based on soil type classification,
ranging from Class I-IV soils as outlined in the National Cooperative
Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Synthesis 253 (Woods 1997), and
based on data developed by Woods and Jedele (1985). This step would
require detailed information on soil conditions at the site. Table 17
describes soil materials, soil classes, values of “n” determined by Woods
and Jedele (1985), and suggested values for “n” for the purposes of
estimating vibration amplitude.

Table 17. Measured and Suggested “n” Values Based on Soil Class


September 2013

As indicated by Wood and Theissen (1982), the use of published
attenuation relationships, based primarily on Wiss (1967) and Attewell
and Farmer (1973), relating hammer energies, scaled distances, and PPVs
to predict vibration levels in moderately large commercial buildings or in
buried structures would probably result in overly conservative estimates.
Wiss (1967, 1974, 1981) does not report data points for complete
evaluation, but rather presents only generalized curves.

Research by Wood and Theissen (1982) and an evaluation of the available
literature indicate that predictions based on Wiss and Attewell and Farmer
are likely to be overly conservative. Therefore, it is prudent to be cautious
about the upper range of values presented in FTA’s _Transit Noise and_
_Vibration Impact Assessment_ guidance manual (Federal Transit
Administration 2006) and the NCHRP Synthesis 218 (Schexnayder and
Ernzen 1999) for the impact pile drivers, because these higher values

Assessment for Construction Equipment

appear to be based on Wiss’s curves. The typical values for impact pile
drivers, reported in these publications, appear to be based on the actual
measured data reported by Martin (1980) and form the basis for Eq. 9
above.

#### 7.1.2 Vibration Amplitudes Produced by Vibratory

**Pile Drivers**

Information regarding vibration amplitudes produced by vibratory pile
drivers is scarce in published literature. However, Wood (1982) presents
some data for vibratory pile drivers. International Construction Equipment
(ICE) has also provided some data for the vibratory pile drivers (Morris
1991, 1996, 1997). ICE conducted tests in 1991 with three different
vibratory pile drivers and measured vibration levels at several distances
between 3 and 100 ft. Wiss (1967, 1974, 1981) also presents some data
curves for vibratory pile drivers. A lack of actual data points and
inconsistency in the curves presented in different publications suggests
that some caution be applied in evaluating the data.

Based on review of the available literature (Wood and Theissen 1982;
Wiss 1967, 1974, 1981) and information provided by ICE (Morris 1991,
1996, 1997), vibration amplitudes produced by vibratory pile drivers can
be estimated by the following equation:

_PPV_ _Vibratory Pile Driver_ _= PPV_ _Ref_ _(25/D)_ _[n ]_ _(in/sec)_ _(Eq. 10)_

Where:

_PPV_ _Ref_ _= 0.65 in/sec for a reference pile driver at 25 ft_

_D = distance from pile driver to the receiver in ft._

_n = 1.1 ( the value related to the attenuation rate through ground)_

The suggested value for “n” is 1.1, the same value used for impact pile
drivers. If desired and if soil information is available, the value of “n” may
be changed to reflect soil type classification, as shown in Table 17.

Vibratory pile drivers generate the maximum vibration levels during the
start-up and shut-down phases of the operation because of the various
resonances that occur during vibratory pile driving (Woods 1997).
Maximum vibration occurs when the vibratory pile driver is operating at
the resonance frequency of the soil-pile-driver system. The frequency
depends on properties of the soil strata being penetrated by the pile.

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 7: Vibration Prediction and Screening

Assessment for Construction Equipment

As indicated in the NCHRP Synthesis 253 (Woods 1997), vibration from
vibratory pile drivers is related to the centrifugal force, which is
proportional to the mass of the rotating eccentric elements, the radius of
eccentricity of rotating elements, and the frequency of the rotating
elements. Because of the scarcity of available data, the effect of
centrifugal force on vibration from vibratory pile drivers could not be
evaluated. In the absence of any reliable data, it is recommended that
vibration from vibratory pile drivers be estimated by using Eq. 10 above.

Eq. 10 can be used to estimate the vibration amplitude during the resonant
start-up and shut-down phases of the pile driving operation. Although
there are no actual data that show the relative magnitude of vibration
during the primary driving phase, away from the resonance effects, it is
estimated that it could be 50% or less of the maximum levels that may
occur during the start-up and shut-down phases. The maximum levels
during the start-up and shut-down phases are the important values that
should be evaluated when assessing potential impacts. Vibration generated
during these start-up and shut-down phases is often very perceptible and is
the source of most complaints from vibratory pile driving activity.

The FTA’s _Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment_ (Federal
Transit Administration 2006) and NCHRP Synthesis 218 (Schexnayder
and Ernzen 1999) state that continuous operation at a fixed frequency may
be more noticeable to nearby residents, even at lower vibration levels. In
addition, the steady-state excitation of the ground may increase the
response at the resonance frequency of building components. Response
may be unacceptable in cases of fragile historical buildings or vibrationsensitive manufacturing processes. Impact pile drivers, conversely,
produce high vibration levels for a short duration (0.2 second) any may
have sufficient time between impacts to allow any resonant response to
decay.

Wood and Theissen (1982) state that vibration levels from vibratory pile
drivers may be at least as severe as those from impact pile drivers, and that
the potential for damage from vibratory pile drivers may be greater than
that from impact hammers because of sustained vibration levels. Vibration
data provided by ICE (Morris 1991, 1996, 1997) support the fact that
vibratory pile drivers generate vibration levels that are somewhat similar
to those produced by impact pile drivers. The use of resonance-free
vibratory pile drivers may be an exception to this inference (see
“Vibration Mitigation Measures for Pile Drivers” section below).

#### 7.1.3 Vibration Amplitudes Produced by

**Hydraulic Breakers**

Review of available literature indicates that there is no information
available about measured vibration amplitudes from hydraulic breakers
used in pavement and concrete demolition projects. Hydraulic breakers
(also called hoe-rams, hydraulic hammers, or mounted impact hammers)
are generally rated by the amount of energy being delivered, typically in
the range of 70-15,000 ft-lbs. Because the breakers are rated in a similar
manner to impact pile drivers, it is reasonable to assume that the approach
presented in Eq. 9 can be used for estimating vibration amplitude from
hydraulic breakers. Because hydraulic breakers generally have much
lower energy ratings than impact pile drivers, Eq. 9 should be adjusted for
typical reference energy of only 5,000 ft-lbs. for hydraulic breakers.

Based on the above discussion, vibration produced by hydraulic breakers
can be estimated by the following formula:

_PPV_ _Hydraulic Breaker_ _= PPV_ _Ref_ _(25/D)_ _[n ]_ _x (E_ _equip_ _/E_ _Ref_ _)_ _[0.5 ]_ _(in/sec) (Eq. 11)_

Where:

_PPV_ _Ref_ _= 0.24 in/sec for a reference hydraulic breaker at 25 ft._

_D = distance from hydraulic breaker to the receiver in ft._

_n = 1.1 (the value related to the attenuation rate through ground)_

_E_ _Ref_ _= 5,000 ft-lbs. (rated energy of reference hydraulic breaker)_

_E_
_equip_

_= rated energy of hydraulic breaker in ft-lbs._

The suggested value for “n” is 1.1. Because vibration from the hydraulic
breakers originates primarily near the ground surface, a value of **“** n **”** based
on soil classification may not necessarily be applicable; however, a higher
value of “n” based on site-specific soil conditions could be used for a lessconservative estimation of vibration amplitude.

### 7.2 Vibration Produced by Other Construction

**Equipment**

Review of available literature indicates that there is limited information
available on vibration source levels from general construction equipment.
The most comprehensive list of vibration source amplitudes is provided in

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 7: Vibration Prediction and Screening

Assessment for Construction Equipment

the document entitled _Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment_
(Federal Transit Administration 2006). This document lists vibration
source amplitudes at 25 ft. for various types of construction equipment.
Table 18 summarizes these and other source levels.

Caltrans has conducted several studies related to ground vibration
produced by crack-and-seat operations. A study conducted by Caltrans
(2000) measured and evaluated ground vibration generated by crack-andseat operations along State Route 101 near Santa Maria. A Walker
Megabreaker Model 8-13000 was used. This machine drops an 8-ft-wide
by 10-ft-tall steel plate weighing 13,000 lbs. approximately 4 ft. Operation
of this machine produced the following results:

 - At 12 m, PPV = 1.25 in/sec.

 - At 27 m, PPV = 0.422 in/sec, 0.62 in/sec, and 0.412 in/sec.

 - At 34 m, PPV = 0.290 in/sec.

 - At 63 m, PPV = 0.083.

Another study (Ames et al. 1976) conducted in 1972 produced the
following results:

 - At 10 ft., PPV = 2.99 in/sec.

 - At 38 ft., PPV = 0.275 in/sec.

The Santa Maria data has been used to develop a reference vibration
amplitude for crack-and-seat operation. Using the measurement at 12 m as
the reference distance, the data corresponds to Eq. 12 with N = 1.5. The
reference amplitude at 25 ft. extrapolated from this is 2.4 in/sec and is
shown in Table 18.

Assessment for Construction Equipment

Table 18. Vibration Source Amplitudes for Construction Equipment

Sources: Federal Transit Administration 1995 (except Hanson 2001 for vibratory rollers) and Caltrans
2000 for crack-and seat-operations.

Using these source levels, vibration from this equipment can be estimated
by the following formula:

_PPV_ _Equipment_ _= PPV_ _Ref_ _(25/D)_ _[n ]_ _(in/sec)_ _(Eq. 12)_

Where:

_PPV_ _Ref_ _= reference PPV at 25 ft._

_D = distance from equipment to the receiver in ft._

_n = 1.1 ( the value related to the attenuation rate through ground)_

The suggested value for “n” is 1.1. Because vibration from this equipment
originates primarily near the ground surface, modifying the value of “n”
based on soil classification may not necessarily be applicable; however, a
higher value of “n” based on site-specific soil conditions could be used for
a less-conservative estimation of vibration amplitude. FTA recommends a
value of “n” of 1.5 for vibration assessment. Using a value of 1.5 is less
conservative than using a value of 1.4 or less (as indicated in Table 17)
because it assumes that vibration will attenuate at a greater rate.

### 7.3 Evaluating Potential Vibration Impacts

As shown in Chapter 6, there is limited consistency between the
categorization of effects and damage thresholds; however, it is apparent
that damage thresholds for continuous sources are less than those for
single-event or transient sources. It is also apparent that the vibration from
traffic is continuous and that vibration from a single blasting event is a
single transient event; however, many types of construction activities fall
between a single event and a continuous source. An impact pile driver, for
example, continuously generates single transient events. As a practical
matter and based on the nature of available criteria, the criteria can only be
reasonably separated into two categories: continuous and transient.

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 7: Vibration Prediction and Screening

Assessment for Construction Equipment

To assess the damage potential from ground vibration induced by
construction equipment, a synthesis of various vibration criteria presented
in Chapter 6 has been developed. This synthesis of criteria essentially
assumes that the threshold for continuous sources is about half of the

threshold for transient sources. A vibration amplitude predicted using Eqs.
9-12 can be compared the criteria in Tables 19 and 20 to evaluate the
potential for damage.

Table 19. Guideline Vibration Damage Potential Threshold Criteria

Note: Transient sources create a single isolated vibration event, such as blasting or drop balls. Continuous/frequent

intermittent sources include impact pile drivers, pogo-stick compactors, crack-and-seat equipment, vibratory
pile drivers, and vibratory compaction equipment.

A similar synthesis of criteria relating to human perception has also been
developed and is summarized in Table 19. A vibration amplitude predicted
with Eqs. 1-4 can be compared to the criteria in Table 20 for a simple
evaluation of the potential for annoyance and adverse impact. Some
individuals may be annoyed at barely perceptible levels of vibration,
depending on the activities in which they are participating.

Table 20. Guideline Vibration Annoyance Potential Criteria

Note: Transient sources create a single isolated vibration event, such as blasting or drop balls. Continuous/frequent

intermittent sources include impact pile drivers, pogo-stick compactors, crack-and-seat equipment, vibratory
pile drivers, and vibratory compaction equipment.

#### 7.3.1 Example Calculations

**Example 1:** An 80,000 ft-lb. pile driver will be operated at 100 ft. from a
new office building and 100 ft. from a historic building known to be

fragile. Evaluate the potential for damage to the buildings and annoyance
to the building occupants. No information on the soil conditions is known.

Use Eq. 10 to estimate the PPV from the pile driving at 100 ft. In the
absence of soil information, use N = 1.1.

_PPV = 0.65 (25/100)_ _[1.1 ]_ _X (80,000/36,000)_ _[0.5 ]_ _= 0.21 in/sec_

Table 19 suggests that an appropriate damage potential threshold for new
commercial buildings is 0.5 in/sec when the source is continuous. The
predicted vibration amplitude of 0.21 in/sec is well below this value,
indicating low potential for structural damage to the building.

Table 19 suggests that an appropriate damage potential threshold for a
fragile building is 0.1 in/sec when the source is continuous. The predicted
vibration amplitude of 0.21 in/sec exceeds this value, indicating potential
for structural damage to the building.

Table 20 suggests that a transient vibration amplitude 0.21 in/sec would be
strongly perceptible, indicating that pile driving could lead to annoyance
of building occupants.

**Example 2:** A vibratory roller will be operated 50 ft. from residences
constructed in the 1940s. A detailed soil study is available indicating that
the soil is hard competent rock. Evaluate the potential for damage to the
buildings and annoyance to the building occupants.

Use Eq. 12 and data from Table 18 to estimate the vibration amplitude.
Hard competent rock is in Soil Class IV. Therefore, N = 1.0 should be
used.

_PPV = 0.210 (25/50)_ _[1 ]_ _= 0.11 in/sec_

Table 19 suggests that an appropriate damage potential threshold for older
residential structures is 0.3 in/sec when the source is continuous. The

predicted vibration amplitude of 0.11 in/sec does not exceed this value,
indicating low potential for structural damage to the building.

Table 20 suggests that a continuous vibration amplitude 0.11 in/sec would
be strongly to severely perceptible, indicating that operation of the roller
could lead to a high level of annoyance of residences.

**Example 3:** Crack-and-seat operations will be conducted on a freeway
located 75 ft. from newly constructed residences and residences
constructed in the 1940s. Soil conditions are known to be dense,

compacted sand. Evaluate the potential for damage to the residences and
annoyance to the building occupants.

Use Eq. 12 to estimate the PPV from the pile driving at 120 ft.. Dense,
compacted sand is in Soil Class IV. Therefore, N = 1.1 should be used.

_PPV = 2.4 (25/120)_ _[1.1 ]_ _= 0.43 in/sec_

Table 19 suggests that an appropriate damage potential threshold for older
residential structures is 0.3 in/sec when the source is continuous. The
threshold for new residential construction is 0.5 in/sec. The predicted
vibration amplitude of 0.43 in/sec is below the 0.5 in/sec threshold for new
residential construction but above the threshold of 0.3 for older

construction, indicating low potential for structural damage to the newer
residences but potential for damage to the older structures.

Table 20 suggests that a transient vibration amplitude 0.43 in/sec would be
severely perceptible, indicating that pile driving could lead to annoyance
of residents.

## Chapter 8

**Methods for Reducing Vibration**

This chapter discusses methods for reducing ground vibration. For the
most part, the methods involve reducing vibration at the source. Wave
barriers treat the transmission path between the source and the receiver.
Once ground vibration is transmitted to a receiver, there are few, if any,
means for reducing the vibration.

### 8.1 Wave Barriers

The following discussion is a summary of the discussion of wave barriers
provided in NCHRP Synthesis 253 (Woods 1997). Richart (1970) also
provides useful information on this subject.

The purpose of a barrier is to reflect or absorb wave energy, thereby
reducing the propagation of energy between a source and a receiver. A
wave barrier is typically a trench or a thin wall made of sheet piles or
similar structural members. The depth and width of a wave barrier must be
proportioned to the wavelength of the wave intended for screening. The
wavelength of a seismic wave is a function of propagation velocity and
frequency. Pile driving typically generates ground vibration with
frequencies in the range of 4-30 Hz. With common wave velocities in the
range of 61-610 m/s, typical wavelengths can be in the range of 3-152 m.

Studies indicate that the depth of a wave barrier must be at least two-thirds
of the seismic wavelength to be screened and that the length of the barrier
must be at least one wavelength to screen even a small area. In one case, a
trench wave barrier that was 1.19 wavelengths deep by 1.79 wavelengths
long resulted in an 88% reduction in amplitude in two small areas behind
the trench. Wave barriers must be very deep and long to be effective, and
they are not cost effective for temporary applications such as pile driving
vibration mitigation.

### 8.2 Vibration Reduction for Impact Pile Drivers

Impact pile driving can be the most significant source of vibration at
construction sites. The principal means of reducing vibration from impact
pile driving are listed below. Some of these methods may not be
appropriate in specific situations, but where they are practical, they can
often be used to reduce vibration to an acceptable level.

 - **Jetting:** Jetting is a pile driving aid in which a mixture of air and water

is pumped through high-pressure nozzles to erode the soil adjacent to
the pile to facilitate placement of the pile. Jetting can be used to bypass
shallow, hard layers of soil that would generate high levels of vibration
at or near the surface if an impact pile driver was used.

 - **Predrilling:** Predrilling a hole for a pile can be used to place the pile

at or near its ultimate depth, thereby eliminating most or all impact
driving.

 - **Using cast-in-place or auger cast piles:** Using cast-in-place or auger

cast piles eliminates impact driving and limits vibration generation to
the small amount generated by drilling, which is negligible.

 - **Using nondisplacement piles:** Use of nondisplacement piles such as

H piles may reduce vibration from impact pile driving because this
type of pile achieves its capacity from end bearing rather than from
large friction transfer along the pile shaft.

 - **Using pile cushioning:** With pile cushioning, a resilient material is

placed between the driving hammer and the pile to increase the period
of time over which the energy from the driver is imparted to the pile.
Keeping fresh, resilient cushions in the system can reduce the
vibration generated by as much as a factor of 2 (Woods 1997).

 - **Scheduling for specific times to minimize disturbance at nearby**

**vibration-sensitive sites:** Adverse effects can be avoided if pile
driving is not scheduled for times at which vibration could disturb
equipment or people. For example, if pile driving near a residential
area can be scheduled during business hours on weekdays, many
people will be at work and will therefore not be affected.

 - **Using alternative nonimpact drivers:** Several types of proprietary

pile driving systems have been designed specifically to reduce impactinduced vibration by using torque and down-pressure or hydraulic
static loading. These methods would be expected to significantly
reduce adverse vibration effects from pile placement. The applicability
of these methods depends in part on the type of soil. The following

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 8: Methods for Reducing Vibration

information is provided for informational purposes only. This
discussion is not intended to favor any commercial product; inclusion
of information on these products does not constitute endorsement or
approval by Caltrans.

 - The first nondynamic system is the Fundex Tubex piling system,
manufactured by Fundex in the Netherlands and marketed by
American Piledriving in California. Tubex piles are installed with
minimal vibration by using torque and down-pressure to produce
true soil displacement piles. A patented cast-steel boring drill tip is
welded to the pipe casing; then, the Tubex machine installs the pile
by gripping the outside of the pipe casing with hydraulic clamps
and, in essence, screwing the pile into the ground. Grout injection
ports are located at the base of the tip, which allows for the
injection of water as a drilling medium and for the injection of
grout to produce a soil-cement mixture around the steel casing.
Once the steel shell is installed and grouted, concrete and
reinforcing are conventionally placed inside the pipe as structurally
required by design, or the pile is left unfilled as a simple pipe pile.

Based on vibration tests performed in 2001 by American
Piledriving, the vibration amplitude generated by the Tubex system
is expected to be about 0.05 in/sec at 25 ft. This amplitude is
significantly lower than vibration generated by conventional
impact or vibratory pile drivers. Tubex piles were evaluated by
Caltrans in a test project conducted near Interstate 280 in the San
Francisco Bay Area. The ultimate capacity of the Tubex pile in
terms of tension and compression exceeded all other pile types
evaluated.

 - The second nondynamic system is the Still Worker (Liddy 2002), a
static load piling system, marketed by the Ken-Jet Corporation in
New Jersey. This system hydraulically installs and retrieves Hpiles, pipe, and sheet piles, generating significantly less vibration
than is generally associated with conventional impact and vibratory
pile drivers. The system uses hydraulics to push in piles in a
smooth, fluid motion that virtually eliminates vibration commonly
associated with the installation of piling. Although there are no
available vibration data for the system, it appears to substantially
reduce vibration from pile driving. A product developed by Giken
Engineering Group called the “Silent Piler” operates in a similar
fashion.

 - Using a vibratory pile driver instead of an impact pile driver can
reduce some vibration problems, but vibration amplitudes are
similar to those of an impact pile driver because a resonance can

September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 8: Methods for Reducing Vibration

occur as the vibratory pile driver starts up and shuts down. One
alternative to conventional vibratory pile drivers is a resonancefree vibrator, or variable eccentric moment vibrator. ICE
manufactures two such models. These vibrators do not vibrate

during start up and shut down, thereby avoiding the excessive
vibrations that are commonly associated with traditional vibratory
units. By changing the static moment, these vibrators can vary the
frequency of operation and the force amplitude. Before the vibrator
is started, two parallel rows of eccentric weights are shifted out of
phase, resulting in no vibration during start up. By changing the
relative orientation of the two rows of parallel eccentric masses,
the static moment is changed. After the vibrator reaches full speed,
the eccentric masses are shifted into phase, resulting in maximum
eccentric moment and maximum amplitude to drive the pile
efficiently. Before shut down, the two rows of eccentric weights
are again shifted out of phase, resulting in no vibration during shut
down.

### 8.3 Vibration Reduction for Hydraulic Breakers

If vibration levels from hydraulic breakers are expected to exceed
applicable vibration limits, the following vibration-reducing measures can
be considered. Some of these methods may not be appropriate in particular
situations, but they can often be used to reduce vibration levels to an
acceptable limit where they are practical.

 - A hydraulic crusher (also called smasher, densifier, processor, or

pulverizer) can be used to break up the material. A hydraulic crusher is
an attachment that is generally mounted on the end of a backhoe,
excavator, or skid-steer. It has large jaws that open and close. When
closed, the attachment can cut through and crush concrete and any
rebar used in the concrete. The attachment can be used for demolition

of concrete dividers, such as those used between roadways, and at
locations where the concrete can be placed between the jaws. For
demolition of a sidewalk or pavement, digging or breaking up of the
surface may be required to allow the concrete to be placed between the
jaws.

 - Saws or rotary rock-cutting heads can be used to cut bridge decks or

concrete slabs into small sections that can be loaded onto trucks for

disposal.

 - Hydraulic splitters can be used to break up concrete. These devices

apply lateral force against the inside of holes drilled into the concrete.


September 2013

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 8: Methods for Reducing Vibration

 - Chemicals can be used to split concrete.

 - Pavement and concrete demolition can be scheduled for certain times

to minimize the disturbance at the nearby vibration-sensitive sites.

### 8.4 Vibration Reduction Measures for Other

**Construction Equipment**

In most cases, vibration induced by typical construction equipment does
not result in adverse effects on people or structures. Noise from the
equipment typically overshadows any meaningful ground vibration effects
on people. Some equipment, however, including vibratory rollers and
crack-and-seat equipment, can create high vibration levels.

Because of the nature of these types of devices, the options for reducing
vibration are limited. Maximizing the distance between the source and
receiver might be possible, but there is usually little or no flexibility in this
regard. Conducting work when most people are not in the area (e.g., at
work) or when sensitive equipment is not operating can avoid or minimize
adverse impacts with this type of equipment, but pavement crack-and-seat
operations often must be conducted at night to avoid disrupting traffic. As
such, little can be done to avoid adverse impacts on people. In some
circumstances, temporary relocation of residents during these operations
may be appropriate; this is often done by offering hotel vouchers to
potentially affected residents.

In the absence of measures than can physically reduce induced ground
vibration, informing the public about the project and the potential effects
of construction activities is, in many cases, the best way to avoid adverse
reactions from the public. The suggested process for engaging the public is
discussed in Chapter 9.

### 8.5 Vibration Reduction for Vehicle Operations

Vehicles traveling on a smooth roadway are rarely, if ever, the source of
perceptible ground vibration. However, discontinuities in roadway
pavement often develop as the result of settling of pavement sections,
cracking, and faulting. When this occurs, vehicles passing over the
pavement discontinuities impart energy into the ground, generating
vibration. In most cases, only heavy trucks, not automobiles, are the
source of perceptible vibration. Trucks traveling over pavement
discontinuities also often rattle and make noise, which tends to make the

event more noticeable when the ground vibration generated may only be
barely noticeable.

Because vibration from vehicle operations is almost always the result of
pavement discontinuities, the solution is to smooth the pavement to
eliminate the discontinuities. This step will eliminate perceptible vibration
from vehicle operations in virtually all cases.

### 8.6 Vibration Reduction for Train Operations

Methods for reducing ground vibration generated by rail operations are
described in FTA 2006. These methods include:

 - maintaining wheel and rail smoothness;

 - locating special trackwork for turnouts and crossovers away from

vibration-sensitive areas;

 - specifying vehicles with low unsprung weight, soft primary

suspension, minimum metal-to-metal contact between moving parts of
the truck, and smooth wheels; and

 - use of special track-support systems such as:

 - resilient fasteners,

 - ballast mats,

 - resiliently supported ties,

 - floating slabs, and

 - speed reduction.

Special track support systems require engineering to ensure optimal
effectiveness in reducing vibration.

**General Procedures for Addressing Vibration**

**Issues**

Concerns about vibration generally arise because of complaints about
existing operations or construction and maintenance activities.
(Construction and maintenance activities are collectively referred to here
as “construction activities.”) Concerns can also arise in response to
planned activities, such as the construction and operation of a new facility
or the modification of an existing facility. This chapter discusses the
recommended procedures for addressing vibration concerns about both
existing and planned activities and operations.

### 9.1 Vibration Concerns about Existing

**Activities and Operations**

Pile driving and crack-and-seat operations near homes or businesses are
the primary subjects of vibration complaints. Vibration complaints can
also be generated in response to traffic operations if pavement is in poor
condition. Increases in traffic, heavy truck, or bus operations resulting
from opening of new transportation facilities or the redirection of traffic
can also trigger complaints. Although complaints can come from any type
of receiver, most are from occupants of residences and from businesses
that have vibration-sensitive equipment or operations. Complaints about
vibration require a response from Caltrans.

The first step in investigating complaints is to interview the individuals
making the complaints (i.e., the complainants) and to assess the severity of
the vibration concern. A list of questions, a screening procedure to
determine the severity of the concern, and a vibration complaint form are
provided in Appendix B for this purpose. In assessing the severity of a
vibration concern, the most important issues are:

 - The type and location of the vibration source(s)

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 9: General Procedures for Addressing Vibration Issues

 - The complainant’s concerns (e.g., annoyance, damage, disruption of

operations)

 - The location that is most sensitive, or where vibration is most

noticeable

The screening procedure may indicate that vibration monitoring should be
conducted. Vibration monitoring of existing operations or construction
activity can range from simple, single-location measurements to more
complex, simultaneous, multi-instrument measurements. The simple
approach consists of taking measurements at the most sensitive location or
the location perceived by the complainant to have the worst level of
vibration. Sufficient data should be collected for each location of interest.

For highway traffic vibrations, 10 heavy-truck pass-bys (preferably worstcase combinations of several trucks) for each location should be measured.
For pile driving or crack-and-seat operations, several minutes of
equipment operation should be monitored at each location of interest. The
measurement results can then be compared to the applicable vibration
criteria.

If the simple measurement indicates that vibration approaches or exceeds
applicable criteria, a more detailed study should be conducted. This study
involves placing a sensor close to the source as a reference and one or
more sensors at the critical locations. The reference sensor remains fixed

in one location near the source, whereas the response sensors may be
moved to different locations. The simultaneous measurements can then be

used to positively identify the vibration source, the drop-off rate, and the
response (i.e., vibration level) at the locations of interest. This information
can be used to identify unusual conditions that may be contributing to the
high vibration condition and to identify a course of action to reduce the
impact.

### 9.2 Vibration Concerns about Planned

**Activities and Operations**

Avoiding adverse vibration effects regarding planned construction
activities and facility operations involves using physical methods to
reduce the actual vibration and good public relations to ensure that the
public is well informed about the work and its potential effects. In general,
literature on the subject shows that only blasting, pile driving, and
pavement breaking have documented examples of potential damage to
buildings (American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials [AASHTO] 1990). For pile driving and pavement breaking, the
potential for damage from vibration is at locations in relatively close


September 2013

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 9: General Procedures for Addressing Vibration Issues

proximity to the activity. However, because the threshold of perception for
vibration is much lower than the threshold for damage, claims of damage
often arise because of perceptible vibration and not because of actual
damage.

Chapter 11 outlines a process for avoiding and addressing potential
problems from the public related to blasting. The following process, which
focuses on vibration from construction activities and facility operations, is
modeled after that process. Every attempt should be made to mitigate the
adverse vibration effects from construction activities through the use of
modern techniques, procedures, and products. It is equally important to
develop a process to avoid and, if necessary, address problems identified
by the public that can arise from construction activities, even when the
levels of vibration are well below the levels at which damage to structures
or excessive annoyance to humans are expected to occur. The following
steps should be taken:

1. Identify potential problem areas surrounding the project site

2. Determine conditions that exist before construction begins

3. Inform the public about the project and potential vibration-related

consequences

4. Schedule work to reduce adverse effects

5. Design construction activities to reduce vibration

6. Notify nearby residents and property owners that vibration-generating

activity is imminent

7. Monitor and record vibration from the activity

8. Respond to and investigate complaints

These steps are described below.

#### 9.2.1 Step 1. Identify Potential Problem Areas

**Surrounding the Project Site**

The first step is to identify the types of dynamic equipment that will be
used on the project. As previously discussed, pile drivers and crack-andseat equipment tend to be the most common source of vibration concerns.
In some cases, vibration from the operation of a new or modified highway
may need to be evaluated. Prediction methods discussed in Chapter 7

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 9: General Procedures for Addressing Vibration Issues

should then be used to estimate distances at which vibration could exceed

perception thresholds and structural damage thresholds.

A question that must be answered before determining a preconstruction
survey radius is whether the intent is to prevent structural damage or to
prevent the perception that structural damage is occurring _._ In general it is
impractical to survey all locations where vibration could be perceptible or
where there could be the perception of damage. Regardless of the radius
selected for preconstruction surveys, there have been numerous instances
where claims of damage came from locations far beyond the surveyed
areas. Hence, there is no reasonable standard distance beyond which no
complaints can be assured.

Bearing in mind human perceptions and economic considerations, the best
solution might be to select structures for preconstruction surveys as
follows:

 - those structures or groups of structures closest to the vibration source,

 - structures within a radius where the effects are estimated to be strongly

perceptible and,

 - any structures at greater distances that, because of historic value or

special conditions, are deemed to deserve special attention.

If the surrounding residents do not view the project as necessarily
beneficial to them, or if the project is otherwise unpopular, the distances
should probably be increased accordingly.

After the decision has been made as to the limit of preconstruction
surveys, anticipate that damage claims may come from residents outside
the limit that would have to be resolved through forensic investigation.
This is discussed in Step 8.

In some special circumstances, an assessment of the vibration propagation
characteristics of the project site may be warranted to improve the
accuracy of the vibration predictions. These special circumstances may
include situations with special receivers, such as a hospital, research
facility, or high-technology facility with vibration-sensitive equipment.
Other circumstances might include situations where vibration is known to
propagate efficiently though the soil on the site.

A method that Caltrans has used to determine site-specific vibration dropoff characteristics involves the generation of vibration on the site and
measurement of the response of the ground at various distances. To
generate a strong vibration signal, Caltrans has driven a heavily loaded


September 2013

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 9: General Procedures for Addressing Vibration Issues

water truck or dump truck at high speed over a series of five 2- by 4-in. or
2- by 6-in. wood boards spaced 25 ft. apart. This method has been proven
to generate a recognizable signal at 90 m (300 ft.). Other methods of
generating vibration are also available and include drop-balls, impact
hammers, and vibratory rollers.

With this method, a minimum of two sensors must be used
simultaneously: one reference sensor and one or more response sensors.
Refer to Chapter 10 for a discussion of vibration measurement
instrumentation. The reference sensor remains fixed at 5 m (16 ft.) from
the centerline of travel (or any convenient distance near the source)
opposite the last board to be run over (most forward in line with the
direction of travel). The response sensors are positioned at various
distances from the source. Because of the steepness of the drop-off curve
near the source, it is a good idea to cover shorter-distance intervals near
the source and longer ones away from the source. To adequately cover the
entire range of the drop-off curve, six to eight locations should be
monitored and at least five truck pass-bys measured at each location.
Frequently, simulations are not possible on the site of interest because of
space limitations. Nearby empty lots or open fields, or data from other
sites known or judged to have similar soil conditions, can then be used.
However, care must be exercised in choosing a representative site because
subsurface conditions can vary substantially.

Once the measurements have been made, the data at each location should
be averaged. Using the reference position and at least two others
(including the farthest one), the soils coefficient of attenuation (or alpha
value,  ) can be calculated using Eq. 6. Ideally, the alpha value should
remain constant for each location, but in reality it will vary as a function
of frequency and position. The average of several values can then be used
to develop a drop-off curve. The vibration amplitudes at all measured
locations should then be plotted to determine how well they fit this curve.
Assuming they fit reasonably well, a normalized drop-off curve can be
developed and used with any source reference level, to predict the future
level at any distance within the range of the curve.

Another method that can be used to determine vibration propagation
characteristics on a site involves measuring the transfer mobility of the
ground. This procedure involves dropping a heavy weight on the ground,
and then measuring the forces into the ground and the response at several
distances from the impact. This procedure is discussed in detail in Federal
Transit Administration 1995.

If it is possible to do the simulations at the site, measurement locations
both inside and outside the buildings of concern should be included to
measure the effects of building amplification or attenuation. Ambient
vibration should also be measured both inside and outside the building to

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 9: General Procedures for Addressing Vibration Issues

document vibration before the construction activity. Any claims that a
Caltrans activity or project has increased ground vibration can then be
assessed by comparing project-related vibration compared to the existing
vibration.

Using the information collected from this study, future vibration can be
predicted and compared to existing ambient vibration, perception and
damage thresholds, or any other applicable criteria. In some cases where
disturbance thresholds for sensitive equipment are not known, vibration
measured near the sensitive equipment can be correlated with the
disturbance of the equipment to establish a threshold.

The methods described here are generally sufficient for identifying the
potential for adverse effects on sensitive equipment. Most situations
involving construction operations near sensitive equipment will require
consulting experts with specialized expertise in this area.

#### 9.2.2 Step 2. Determine Conditions That Exist

**Before Construction Begins**

There are various methods that can be used to conduct preconstruction
surveys, but all must meet the primary purpose of documenting all the
defects and existing damage in the structures concerned. An inadequate
preconstruction survey can be worse than no preconstruction survey at all.
Preexisting defects that are not listed in the preconstruction survey will
probably then be attributed to the construction by the property owner.
Unless these can be refuted through forensic investigation, the
complainant will probably be successful.

Secondary purposes of the preconstruction survey include answering any
questions the homeowner may have regarding the project and looking for
anything that might require correcting before construction starts or that
may place an unexpected limit on blast design. Examples include antique
plates that are leaning against a wall or precariously balanced figurines.
These should be secured for the duration of the project if there is any

concern.

Surveys can consist of drawings on paper, high-resolution video, black
and white photography, or any other method that adequately documents
existing defects and damage. It is also helpful if the possible cause of the
defect can be determined and listed. Oriard (1999) and Dowding (1996)
describe preconstruction survey methods in detail.


September 2013

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 9: General Procedures for Addressing Vibration Issues

In some instances, homeowners will prefer that their homes not be
surveyed. This is usually for the sake of the owners’ privacy, and a
notation should be made for that structure as to the time and date, the
specific comment made and the person who made it. On some occasions, a
homeowner may terminate a preconstruction survey before it is complete.
Again, the survey should be annotated accordingly.

It is usually advantageous to conduct postconstruction surveys to verify
that no additional damage has been caused by the construction activity.

All residential structures suffer from normal shrinkage of materials caused
by diurnal thermal strains and possible settling that start to occur soon
after construction. This can present a problem on long-term projects when
relatively new homes are included in the preconstruction survey. The
normal shrinkage cracks and defects may not show up before the
preconstruction survey, but may be there for any postconstruction
inspection. The only solution is to investigate them thoroughly to
determine whether it was possible that construction activity caused the
defect. This will normally require the services of an experienced forensic
investigator.

It is also good practice to examine homes both near and far from the
construction activity. If cracks or other defects are consistent throughout
the area, they are likely the result of thermal stresses or settlement. Cracks
or defects that diminish with distance from the vibration source may be
indicative of effects caused by the source. Cracks that occur only on
surfaces exposed to the sun are indicative of thermal cracking.

There is a tendency for insurance companies to settle smaller claims rather
than pay the cost involved in determining the actual cause. This is not only
technically and philosophically unsound, but also an open invitation for
additional claims from surrounding neighbors.

#### 9.2.3 Step 3. Inform the Public about the Project

**and Potential Construction-Related**
**Consequences**

Good public relations with the neighbors nearest the project, as well as all
interested parties, are always beneficial. Most homeowners do not have
experience with construction vibration, and may have concerns about their
own safety and the safety of their homes.

If the situation warrants, a meeting should be held and a presentation made
that explains the reason for the project, that construction will be necessary,

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 9: General Procedures for Addressing Vibration Issues

what the residents can expect to hear and feel from the construction, any
specific warning signals that will be used, and the intent of the
preconstruction survey. Knowledgeable persons should attend to answer
questions. There should be a handout that explains all of the above
information and includes phone numbers to call if there are problems or
questions. The person or company that will conduct the preconstruction
surveys should be introduced. The main purpose of such a meeting is to
educate the neighbors and to put their minds at ease. Such a meeting,
conducted properly, can greatly reduce the potential for problems with
neighboring property owners.

Another opportunity to conduct good public relations is during the
preconstruction survey. The informational sheet from the meeting should
be distributed during the survey. The person or persons that conduct the
survey should be conversant enough about the project to answer any
questions that homeowners might have.

Homeowners should be provided with a procedure for registering
complaints with Caltrans in the event that vibration is found to be
excessive. This procedure should identify a contact person and phone
number or email address.

#### 9.2.4 Step 4. Schedule Work to Reduce Adverse

**Effects**

As long as safety considerations can be met, construction activity should
be scheduled to occur during times of maximum human activity, rather
than during times of extreme quiet. In some cases, nearby sources of noise
and/or vibration can be used to mask the noise from construction

activities. For example, if highway work can be conducted during daytime
hours, normal traffic noise may mask much of the construction noise.
Night work should be avoided, although night work is required to avoid
disruption of commute traffic flows in many cases.

Other factors may need to be considered as well. A survey of the area
should disclose locations with critical activities that might require close
coordination. For example, if a hospital where surgery is conducted or
other facilities with equipment highly sensitive to vibration are nearby,
coordination is necessary so that construction does not interfere with
operations of those facilities. Medical equipment that is particularly
sensitive to vibration include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems,
scanners, and microscopes.


September 2013

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 9: General Procedures for Addressing Vibration Issues

#### 9.2.5 Step 5. Design Construction Activities to

**Minimize Vibration**

Where adverse vibration effects are anticipated, reasonable efforts should
be made to reduce those effects. Chapter 8 discusses methods to reduce
vibration from construction.

#### 9.2.6 Step 6. Notify Nearby Residents and

**Property Owners That Vibration-Generating**
**Activity Is Imminent**

Once work has been scheduled, nearby residents and property owners
should be notified about the specific times and dates that vibrationgenerating activity will occur. Many complaints occur because a resident
or property owner was not aware that the construction activity would

occur.

#### 9.2.7 Step 7. Monitor and Record Vibration

**Effects from Construction**

Although it is possible to estimate the levels of construction-induced
vibration with some confidence, field monitoring and recording of
vibration effects is sometimes warranted. Monitoring records provide
excellent tools for evaluating the potential for damage from construction
activities. The monitoring and recording should be conducted with
equipment specifically intended for this purpose, including
accelerometers, velocity sensors, and data-recording or data-logging
devices. Equipment used to collect and evaluate vibration data is discussed
in Chapter 10.

In situations in which there is considerable opposition to a project and
damage claims are anticipated, monitoring and recording should be
conducted by a third party. In situations in which there is little chance for
claims or where monitoring is being done solely to ensure that
specifications are being met, the construction contractor could conduct the
monitoring, although it is advisable for the contractor to have a third-party
vibration consultant oversee and approve the monitoring and recording

process.

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 9: General Procedures for Addressing Vibration Issues

#### 9.2.8 Step 8. Respond to and Investigate

**Complaints**

An adequate process for handling complaints should be established.
Neighboring residents should know whom to contact with a concern or
complaint, regardless of whether it involves a claim of damage. In all
instances, a form that documents the details should be initiated on receipt
of a complaint. A sample construction vibration complaint form is
provided in Appendix B.

For minor complaints, responsible, knowledgeable contractor personnel
might conduct the investigation. It is advisable to have a qualified forensic
investigator look into claims of damage. The investigator might be the
same party that conducted the preconstruction survey or conducted the
monitoring. Prompt investigation is advisable. Correction of the problem,
if caused by the construction activity, should also be handled promptly.

A vibration specification can be valuable in avoiding problems resulting
from construction vibration. Because it is impossible to foresee all
variables that may be encountered on various project sites, specifications
should be developed specifically for each construction site. A sample
vibration specification developed for a construction site with nearby
historic structures is provided in Appendix C.

### 9.3 Vibration Study Reports

Any time a vibration field study is conducted, the results should be
documented in a report. Depending on the number of sites measured,
amount of data collected, methodologies used, and the importance of the
study, the report may range from a simple one or two paged memo, to a
report of twenty or more pages long. A vibration study can be considered a
mini-research project, and should contain enough information for the
reader to independently come to the same conclusions.

Normally, a vibration report should contain the following topics:

 - project title and description;

 - introduction;

 - objectives;

 - background;


September 2013

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 9: General Procedures for Addressing Vibration Issues

 - study approach;

 - instrumentation;

 - measurement sites;

 - measurements;

 - data reduction;

 - measurement results;

 - data analysis;

 - results and comparison with criteria;

 - conclusions and recommendations;

 - tables showing all measured data, summaries of results, analysis, and

standards;

 - figures showing site layouts and cross sections, instrument setups,

drop-off curves, and other pertinent illustrations; and

 - references cited.

In short and simple vibration studies, the above topics may be described
within a few sentences in a memorandum. In more complex studies, a
fairly extensive report is usually required. Refer to Appendix A for more
detailed information on vibration study reports.

## Chapter 10

**Vibration Measurement and Instrumentation**

### 10.1 Vibration Measurement Equipment

Ground vibration is typically measured with a sensor that produces an
electrical signal that is proportional to amplitude amplitude of the ground
motion. These sensors are called transducers because they “transduce” the
ground motion into an analogous electronic signal. Transducers can be
designed to produce a signal that is analogous to the displacement,
velocity, or acceleration of the ground motion. Velocity transducers
(seismometers) and acceleration transducers (accelerometers) are the most
widely used transducers for measuring ground motion. Vibration
transducers measure vibration in one axis. These transducers can be

combined into a triaxial array to simultaneously measure vibration in three
orthogonal axes.

During the period between 1958 and 1994, all vibration monitoring
conducted by Caltrans was performed by staff from the Caltrans Translab.
A transducer calibration system consisting of a shaker table mounted on a
concrete vibration isolation pad and a camera/amplifier system that
measured displacement allowed Translab to calibrate its own transducers
with traceability to the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST), formerly known as the National Bureau of Standards (NBS).
Transducers were calibrated by mounting them on the shaker table and
running the table at a known frequency and displacement. Translab is no
longer responsible for vibration studies. These studies are now conducted
by Caltrans headquarters staff and vibration consultants retained by
Caltrans.

Historically, Caltrans used both seismometers and accelerometers to
measure ground motion. Seismometers used by Caltrans measure vibration
at relatively low frequencies, usually between 1 and 200 Hertz (Hz),
through magnetic induction that produced a voltage proportional to
velocity. Because seismometers are typically large and can weigh as much
as about 7 kilograms (kg) (15 pounds [lbs]), they typically can be placed
directly on the ground without special mounting attachments if the
mounting surface is stiff, such as hard soil, a concrete sidewalk, flagstone,

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 10: Vibration Measurement and Instrumentation

or asphalt. If used on soil, the seismometer should be firmly embedded in
the soil by embedding the entire base in the soil.

An accelerometer measures acceleration directly. When used with an
integrator, an accelerometer can also measure velocity and displacement.
Accelerometers used by Caltrans have piezoelectric (charge-generating)
crystals. As the transducer vibrates with the surface it is mounted on,
acceleration changes the compression of the crystal, which in turn causes
variations in the electrical charge across the crystal faces. These charge
variations are proportional to acceleration.

Accelerometers are typically small and not as sensitive as seismometers.
The advantage is that they have a wider frequency range, typically from 1
Hz to several kilo-Hertz (kHz). Because of their small size and lack of
mass, accelerometers should not be placed directly on the ground, floor, or
other vibrating surface without proper mounting. Accelerometers can be
mounted in various ways, depending on the surface. Accelerometers can
be adhered to a vibrating surface such as floors, sidewalks, or walls using
scientific wax, beeswax, or other special wax provided by the
accelerometer manufacturer can be used. Threaded studs adhered to the

surface with epoxy can also be used. For good high frequency (up to 100
Hz) coupling to soil, accelerometers should be mounted to an aluminum
spike.

An accelerometer can also be mounted via a magnet (or adhesive) to a
heavy block of steel weighing 5-10 kg (10-20 lbs). The steel block can
then be placed directly on the ground or other surface if the steel block
does not rock. The mass of the steel block provides adequate coupling of
the accelerometer with the ground for the low-frequency, low-level
vibrations generated by transportation facilities and construction activities.
Other mounting options are also available. Refer to the accelerometer
manufacturer’s recommendations for other mounting options.

The signal from a vibration transducer can be directly conditioned and
displayed with stand-alone equipment or it can be recorded with an analog
or digital recording device for subsequent analysis. Stand-alone or
software-based digital fast fourier transform (FFT) analyzers are
commonly used to evaluate the recorded signal. Most analyzers can
integrate the signal so that velocity and displacement values can be
determined from an acceleration signal. Overall peak amplitudes (i.e.,
PPV) in the time domain can be displayed or, if desired, the frequency
spectrum of the signal can be evaluated in the frequency domain (i.e., onethird octave band or narrow band spectrum). A variety of averaging
methods is often available.

## Chapter 11

**Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting**

### 11.1 Introduction to Blasting

Often, the only means of loosening a rock mass and reducing it to a
material of manageable size is to blast using explosives placed within
drilled holes. Many variables relate to the execution of a blast, only some
of which are within the control of the blaster. Some of these variables are

difficult, if not impossible, to adequately define. As such, blasting is still
part “science” and part “art,” based on the laws of physics and the
capability and experience of the blaster.

#### 11.1.1 Blasting Terminology

The following terms are commonly used in blasting and should be
understood by anyone involved in the subject.

 - **Downhole blasting:** Downhole blasting is a type of blasting in which

explosives are loaded into drilled holes, as opposed to charges being
placed on the surface. Surface charges do not have application in
conventional construction blasting situations, especially in urban
settings.

 - **Burden:** Burden represents that volume of material that a detonating

hole or holes are expected to fragment and shift. There are two types
of burdens: drilled burden and shot burden. Drilled burden is the

distance between a row of holes and the nearest free face, and is
measured perpendicular to the row of holes. It is also the distance
between two rows of holes. Shot burden represents the distance
between a hole that is detonating and the nearest free face that is
developing in the blast. Unless otherwise specified, the term usually
refers to the drilled burden.

 - **Spacing:** Spacing represents the distance between holes in a row. A

drill pattern is always described in terms of (in order) burden and

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

spacing (e.g., a 6-foot by 8-foot pattern has a burden of 6 ft. and a
spacing of 8 ft.)

 - **Subdrilling:** Subdrilling is the amount of hole that is drilled below the

intended floor of the excavation. Except in situations in which the rock
is in flat bedding planes, the detonating charge usually leaves a crater
at the bottom of the hole rather than shearing the rock on a horizontal
plane. Accordingly, it is not uncommon to subdrill a distance that
approaches half of the burden distance to be able to excavate to the
intended depth.

 - **Stemming:** To confine the energy from the explosive, the top portion

of the hole is stemmed (back-filled) with inert material. Because of
their proximity to the hole, drill cuttings are usually used, although
other material such as stemming plugs can be used. Crushed stone
chips are superior to drill cuttings for stemming material because they
tend to lock in place under pressure.

 - **Decks or decking:** Decks or decking is a means of separating two or

more charges within a hole. This step is usually taken to (1) reduce the
amount of explosive detonating in a given instant by having the decks
fired on different delays, or (2) to avoid loading explosives in weak
zones or mud seams in the rock. Decks are separated by inert
stemming material and require some means of initiating each deck.
Most blasters prefer to avoid the use of decking, however, because it
increases the chances for misfired holes and is fairly labor intensive.

 - **Primary (production) blast:** A primary (or production) blast is

intended to adequately fragment a given volume of rock. The rock may
be removed in one or more primary blasts. If the depth of an
excavation is sufficient to require removal in more than one lift, each
lift would be removed using one or more primary blasts.

 - **Secondary blast:** Secondary blasts may be required to remove or

reduce material that is not adequately fractured in primary blasts (i.e.,
trimming blasts or removing high bottom). Also secondary blasts are
used for boulders whether or not primary blasting was conducted.

 - **Powder factor:** The powder factor is the ratio between explosives

consumed and material blasted, usually defined in pounds per cubic
yard for construction blasts. When discussing powder factors, it is
important to know whether one is using “shot powder factor” or “pay

[or yield] powder factor.” Shot powder factor includes the material in
the subdrilling zone in the calculations, while pay powder factor does

not.

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

 - **Detonator:** Detonators are devices, either electric or nonelectric, that

are used to detonate the explosive charges.

 - **Delay:** The delay is the time interval between detonators (and their

corresponding explosive charges) exploding. Because modern
initiation systems provide for further subdividing of the delay times in
conventional detonators, delay times can be tuned for specific blasting
needs.

 - **Initiation system:** The initiation system is the entire system for

initiating the blast, including the blasting machine or starter,
detonators, delay devices, and interconnecting parts.

 - **Dynamite:** Dynamite was one of the earliest explosive charges. It was

originally sensitized with nitroglycerin, but now uses other sensitizers.

 - **Slurry, watergel, emulsion:** These products are modern explosive

products in which portions of the ingredients have been replaced with
water and various emulsifiers, gums, and other substances. These
products come in either packaged or free-flowing form, and poured or
pumpable forms.

 - **ANFO:** ANFO is an inexpensive blasting agent consisting of 94%

prilled ammonium nitrate and 6% #2 diesel fuel (by weight). There are
variations of this product in which other materials are added to
increase the energy yield. Because of the reduced sensitivity of this
material, it requires the use of a more-sensitive explosive for initiation.

 - **Booster:** A booster is a fairly sensitive charge that is used to initiate

less-sensitive explosive charges. A booster is often in a cast form with
a detonator well or detonating cord tunnel, but it can also be a
cartridge product.

 - **Detonating Cord:** Detonating Cord consists of a core charge of

pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) wrapped with layers of plastics and
textiles. It is available in various core loadings, all of which detonate at
approximately 23,000 ft/sec. Originally developed as an initiation
system, it has also been used in specialized blasting situations as the
primary charge. Because of the extremely high noise level, this
product is not normally used on urban blasting projects. (PETN is also
the base charge in most detonators and is an ingredient in most cast
boosters.)

 - **Presplitting:** Presplitting is a procedure in which a row of lightly

loaded holes is detonated ahead of the main production blast. It is
intended to propagate a crack along the row of holes to protect the

final perimeter wall by allowing expanding gases to vent and
preventing back-break from subsequent detonating production holes. It
has been shown that a presplit crack has little or no effect in reducing
vibration from subsequent blasts; in fact, a presplitting blast creates
more vibration per unit of explosive than other forms of blasting.

 - **Smooth blasting:** Smooth blasting is similar to presplitting, except

that the holes are detonated after the production holes in the main
blast. The intent is not to form a crack, but to blast loose the remaining
burden with the lighter charges without causing excessive damage to
the perimeter wall. In this instance, the charge weights in the nearest
production holes are usually reduced.

 - **Sinking cut:** A sinking cut is a blast in which no free vertical (or

sloped) face exists and in which it is necessary to ramp down into a
horizontal surface. In this type of blast, a portion of the blasted
material must be expelled upward to make room for the expanding
material from subsequent holes detonating. Some flyrock may occur
and must be taken into account.

 - **Throw or heave:** Throw or heave is movement or shifting of the

blasted material an intended distance and direction.

 - **Flyrock:** Flyrock is material that is expelled from the blast and travels

farther than expected or intended.

 - **Blasting mats:** Blasting mats are mats used to cover a blast in an

urban situation where flyrock cannot be tolerated and where the
situation dictates that explosives be loaded fairly high in the holes. (It
is not practical to cover large blast areas, and prevention of flyrock is
best addressed in blast design for those situations.) Blasting mats are
usually fabricated from sections of rubber tires, manila rope, used
conveyor belting, or other similar materials. Many contractors cover
the blast with soil, sand, or other fine material; this step can be
successful, but it is necessary to use a sufficient amount of covering
and to use covering that does not contain rock or other projectiles.
Blast covering with any of these materials or devices must be done
carefully so that the initiation system is not damaged.

 - **Scaled distance (square root or cube root):** Scaled distance is a

means of scaling a ratio of distance and charge weight so that effects
from various blasts can be compared or estimated. Once a blaster has
recorded data from a given blast site, scaled distance can be used as a
tool to assist in designing future blasts. Square-root scaled distance is
derived by dividing the distance between the detonating charge and the


September 2013

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

object of interest by the square root of the charge weight. Square root
scaling is used for vibration estimations where linear charges (length is
more than twice the diameter) are used. Cube-root scaled distance is
derived similarly, using the cube root of the charge weight instead of
the square root. It is conventional to use cube root scaling for
estimating air overpressure and for infrequent instances in which
vibration estimations involve a spherical charge (diameter is greater
than half the length).

 - **Overburden:** Overburden is soil and other materials that overlay the

rock to be blasted. Overburden is usually removed before drilling, but
it is occasionally left in place to confine the blast and to allow loading
explosives higher in the hole (nearer to the top of the rock).

#### 11.1.2 Blasting Process

After the decision has been made to conduct blasting at a construction site,
the necessary permits obtained, and arrangements made for explosives
storage, the first consideration is usually the size of the drill that will be
used. For large excavations, large-diameter drills (4-6 in.) will provide
better production than smaller drills, but will result in larger material. A
larger number of smaller holes (2-3 in.) will take longer to drill and load,
but will provide better fragmentation and easier handling of material.
Other considerations are the size of the digging and hauling equipment,
the location of any local utilities, nearby structures, vibration and air
overpressure or airblast limitations for the specific site, and the lengths of
drill steel available.

The blaster uses the borehole diameter and the considerations above to
formulate blast designs--laying out burden and spacing, depth of hole
(including subdrilling), type of initiation system, explosive products, and
sequence of initiation. The blaster often uses timing and the sequence of
initiation to control the direction of heave and to allow time for the earlier
rows’ burden to begin to move before the later rows detonate.

At this point, the blaster can document his intentions on a blasting plan,
but he must have the latitude to make changes as drilling progresses and
more is learned about the site geology. One or more test blasts are not
unusual. The rock from a preceding blast will usually be removed before
the succeeding blast is loaded and shot, thus providing a space for the
expansion, or swell, of the material in the succeeding blast. If
circumstances dictate, however, a portion of the shot rock may be left in
place to help contain the material in the front row of the succeeding blast.

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

The actual loading process will depend on the type of explosives to be
used, but will generally consist of the following. (Please note that only the
blaster and those persons necessary for the loading process are allowed
within 50 ft. of a blast while it is being loaded.)

1. The detonators are laid out near the holes according to the desired

initiation sequence.

2. The primer is made up by inserting the detonator securely into the

priming charge and is lowered to the bottom of the hole.

3. A denser bottom charge (if desired) is loaded. If there is water in the

holes, a water-resistant explosive is loaded until the column builds up
out of the water. The main explosive charge then is loaded. Holes are
normally loaded to a specific height; however, in cases where the exact
quantity of explosive is critical, holes might be loaded with a specific
number of cartridges or containers of bulk product. If bulk loading
equipment is used, the density of the product and the quantity loaded
can be controlled by the operator.

4. A second primer is added, if desired.

5. After a hole is loaded with the desired quantity of explosive, the

remainder of the hole is stemmed or backfilled with inert material.

6. After all holes are loaded and stemmed, the initiation system, except

for the starter or blasting machine, is connected and checked. In the
case of electric detonators, a Blaster’s Galvanometer or Blaster’s
Multimeter is used to check the resistance of the system. Other
systems are usually checked visually.

7. Blasting mats or other coverings are put in place, if they are to be used.

8. When the blast is ready to be detonated, the area is cleared, the

blasting signals are initiated, and the blaster prepares to connect the
starter or blasting machine.

9. Just before initiation, the blaster connects the starter or blasting

machine, then detonates the blast at the proper time.

10. During and immediately following the blast, the blaster and his crew

watch for any sign of a possible misfire. If a misfire is suspected, the
area remains secured and no one, including the blaster, is allowed to
approach the blast for at least 30 minutes. (This is a California
Occupational Health and Safety Administration-mandated time

period. Although seldom used in construction blasting, the use of cap
and fuse would mandate a 60-minute wait.)

### 11. As soon as it is safe to do so (and following the mandatory wait if a

misfire is suspected), the blaster inspects the site.

12. After any misfires are cleared and the site inspection is complete, the

“all clear” signal can be given and personnel are allowed back into the
blast area.

As blasting proceeds through the project, the blaster can fine-tune his blast
designs. Quite often, the best blasts will occur near the end of the blasting
program because the blaster will have gradually increased his or her
knowledge of how the rock on the site breaks.

### 11.2 Vibration and Air Overpressure Concerns

**that Arise from Blasting**

When a blast is detonated, only a portion of the energy is consumed in
breaking up and moving the rock. The remaining energy is dissipated in
the form of seismic waves expanding rapidly outward from the blast,
either through the ground (as vibration) or through the air (as air
overpressure or airblast). While a blaster can quite easily design his blasts
to stay well below any vibration or air overpressure levels that could cause
damage, it is virtually impossible to design blasts that are not perceptible
by people in the vicinity.

As seismic waves travel outward from a blast, they excite the particles of
rock and soil through which they pass, causing them to oscillate. Spherical
spreading, imperfect coupling, and other factors cause seismic waves to
dissipate rapidly with distance, normally by two-thirds for each doubling
of distance from the source. The motion of particles at a given point in the
earth is measured when blast vibration is recorded. Blast vibration is

described using the following terms.

 - **Displacement:** Displacement is the farthest distance that the ground

moves before returning to its original position. For blasting,
displacement is usually only a few thousandths or ten-thousandths of
an inch.

 - **Particle velocity:** Particle velocity is the velocity at which the ground

moves.

 - **Peak particle velocity (PPV):** PPV is the greatest magnitude of

particle velocity associated with an event.

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

 - **Acceleration:** Acceleration is the rate at which particle velocity

changes. Acceleration is measured in in/sec [2], mm/sec [2], or g.

 - **Frequency:** Frequency is the number of oscillations per second that a

particle makes when under the influence of seismic waves. Frequency
is measured in Hz.

 - **Propagation velocity:** Propagation velocity is the speed at which a

seismic wave travels away from the blast. Propagation velocity is
measured in ft/sec. (Please note that propagation velocity is several
orders of magnitude greater than particle velocity.)

When blast vibration is recorded with a seismograph, three mutually
perpendicular sensors record particle velocities in longitudinal (radial),
transverse, and vertical axes; the PPVs recorded for each axis are the main
data of interest for comparison with damage criteria. Because the data are
recorded against a time base, other information such as frequency,
displacement, acceleration, and true vector sum (resultant) can be
calculated and included on the record.

The resultant particle velocity is the highest particle velocity in any
direction. Although the resultant particle velocity is the highest particle
velocity in any direction, the conventions and standards currently in use
are based on data that were gathered when it was impractical to obtain true
resultant data. Resultant values have become easily obtainable since the
development of the digital seismograph and digital recording techniques.
Therefore, when using modern prediction curves or blasting level criteria
that are based on older data, one should use individual axis peaks rather
than the resultant. If it is desirable to use the resultant instead of individual

peaks, allowances need to be made that consider the higher numbers that
would be obtained. (The true resultant PPV could be as much as 1.73
times the highest individual peak, although in actual practice it is usually
only about 10-20% greater.)

In all instances, body waves (compression and shear waves that pass
through the ground) and surface waves (waves that travel along the
surface of the ground) diminish with distance, although they dissipate at
differing rates. Body waves typically have a higher frequency than surface
waves and are dominant close to the blast; therefore, the frequencies of the
PPVs closer to the blast will be higher. As the distance from the blast
increases, body waves dissipate faster than surface waves; therefore, the
surface waves become dominant and the frequencies (and intensities) of
the PPVs are lower. Exceptions can occur when waves propagate in
underlying stiff soil or rock, and emerge as the dominant wave at large
distances.

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

When the distance between the recording point and the blast is large
enough, waves that have traveled different paths arrive at different times
with spreading and some overlap. Recorded at greater distances, the entire
blast begins to take on the characteristics of a single point detonation of
relatively long duration.

Although residential structures may not be as strongly constructed as
engineered structures, it is unusual to find damage to them from blast
vibration. In numerous instances, vibration levels far greater than the
maximum levels recommended by the U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) or
Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation Enforcement (OSMRE) failed
to cause damage. With regard to residences, the main issue with blast
vibration is the perception of some residents that, because they could hear
and feel the blast vibration, the vibration must have caused some damage
to their residence. It is not unusual for a homeowner to be unaware of

cracks or other defects in his or her residence that have developed slowly
because of settlement or thermal strains. When a nearby blast is detonated
and the homeowner examines his or her structure more closely, it is not
surprising that defects are attributed to the event.

Homeowners with wells, especially in times of drought, can have major
concerns over the effects of blast vibration on their water source, although
vibration alone would not be expected to damage a well. If a blast was
detonated in close enough proximity that rock-block movement pinched
off a well, the well could sustain damage, but it would not have been
caused by vibration (Robertson 1980; Rose 1991). In some situations,
vibration is used by the oil industry to enhance permeability and well
production.

### 11.3 Methods of Predicting Blast Vibration and

**Air Overpressures**

To predict the intensities of blast-induced vibration and air overpressures
from blasting, a scaling method is usually used that considers the energy
released, the distance to the blast, and their relationship to the intensities
derived. Other variables affect the intensities to a lesser extent.

#### 11.3.1 Predicting Blast Vibration

Square-root scaled distance is a scale that divides the distance from the
point of interest to the blast by the square root of the largest charge weight
detonated on one delay period. All explosives detonating within any given
8-millisecond (ms) time period are typically counted as having been

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

detonated on the same delay. (The blaster may be separating his
detonating charges by more or less than 9 ms. In any case, all explosives
detonating within any 8-ms period are combined for typical prediction
calculations.)

The most commonly accepted blast vibration prediction curves in use were
developed by Lewis L. Oriard, a noted seismologist from Huntington
Beach, California (now retired), and are based on data gathered from a
large number of blasts in various geological settings. Other researchers
have come to similar conclusions, with their estimations falling within
Oriard’s parameters.

Figure 6 contains curves representing Oriard’s upper and lower bounds for
typical down-hole blasting, with a higher approximation for those
instances where there is very high confinement, such as in presplitting.
Because of the many variables involved in blast design and site-specific
geology, data points could fall above or below the bounds for typical data
shown on the graph.

Oriard’s basic formula for predicting blast vibration is:

_(Eq. 13)_
_PPV = K (Ds)_ _[ -1.6 ]_

Where:

_PPV = peak particle velocity (in in/sec),_

_Ds = square-root scaled distance (distance to receiver in ft._

_divided by square root of charge weight in lbs.)_

_K = a variable subject to many factors, as described below_

This equation is similar to Eq. 7 presented in Chapter 4 and Eqs. 1-4 in
Chapter 2. The K factor (and the resulting PPV) decreases with the
following:

 - decreased confinement of energy,

 - decreased elastic moduli of the rock,

 - increased spatial distribution of the energy sources,

 - increased time of energy release or timing scatter, and

 - decreased coupling of the energy sources.

PPV increases when these changes are reversed. Of the factors listed
above, confinement of the explosive energy will probably be the mostimportant factor after charge weight and distance. Confinement of the
energy is increased as the burden, depth of burial, and quality of rock
increase. The combined K factor for Oriard’s upper and lower bounds are
242 and 24, respectively. Most conventional blasts will fall between these
bounds. The combined K factor for a blast under extremely high
confinement is 605.

An exponent of -1.6 is typical. This exponent may be more negative for
body waves in very close proximity to the blast or less negative where
surface waves dominate.

The exponent -1.6 is more negative than the value of -1.0 to -1.4
recommended for construction equipment in Table 17. This suggests that
blast vibration amplitudes in general attenuate at a higher rate than
vibration from construction equipment. Persons experienced in blast
vibration prediction will use the range given in the curves (or formulas) as
a basis and adjust them for any blast-specific variables that they can
quantify through experience. They will need information from the blaster
(or the blaster’s records) regarding charge weights per delay, timing
schemes, and other factors.

In addition to ensuring that the charge weights obtained from the blaster
are accurate, the correct number of holes per delay should be verified and,
if more than one hole or deck will detonate simultaneously, the spatial
separation of those holes or decks should be noted. Two holes that
detonate simultaneously will not generate the same vibration as a single
hole containing the same weight as the two holes combined; the greater
the distance between holes detonating simultaneously, the less they
cooperate in increasing vibration.

With regard to distance measurements, blast-induced ground vibration can
travel only through the ground; it cannot jump across an open space. The
shortest path through the ground between the detonating hole and the
object of interest should be the distance used. The correct square-root
scaled distance is the lowest number calculated for various configurations
within the blast and will more closely relate to the intensity of vibration.
Technically speaking, there are as many square-root scaled distances as
there are holes detonating. If all the holes are loaded identically and are
detonated on individual delays, the closest hole will naturally yield the
lowest number. If the blast has varying charge weights (the shot may be
deeper in some areas), the lowest square-root scaled distance may actually
be calculated from a hole that is farther away.

A site-specific prediction curve is initiated when results from several
recorded blasts have been plotted on a graph, although it should not be

September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

assumed that all future blasts will follow the results of just a few blasts.
The confidence level increases as additional data are added, although
some scatter in the data points can be expected. It is also helpful to have
PPV readings over a wide range of distances (and square-root scaled
distance) to provide linearity to the plot. If all recordings are made at one
distance, the data points will be clustered in a general zone on the chart
and it will be difficult to obtain a reasonable regression plot.

#### 11.3.2 Predicting Air Overpressures from Blasting

Air overpressures from blasting can be predicted by using curves in a
manner similar to vibration prediction; however, cube-root distance
scaling, not square-root distance scaling, is normally used. Figure 7
depicts curves that are based on data gathered from blasts in various
locations and from research conducted by various individuals and
organizations, including USBM. Again, because of the variables, many of
which are difficult to quantify, data points for a given event may fall
above or below the bounds shown on the graph. The prediction curves
were established using the basic formula for estimating air overpressures:

_Peak air overpressure (in pounds per square inch [psi]) = K ( Ds )_ _[-1.2]_ _(Eq. 14)_

Where:

_Ds = cube-root scaled distance (distance to receiver in ft, divided_

_by cube root of charge weight in lbs.)_

The curves representing the normal upper and lower bounds for confined
charges use combined K factors (intercepts at a D s of 1) of 2.5 and 0.78,
respectively. The curve for unconfined charges uses a combined K factor
of 82.

The attenuation slope of -1.2 is typical for static conditions and represents
a reduction of approximately 7.2 dB for each doubling of distance. Some
researchers have used attenuation slopes as flat as -1.0 (corresponding to 6
dB per doubling of distance), but the difference does not become a major
factor until a considerable distance has been reached. Atmospheric
variables such as wind and temperature inversions have a greater effect on
attenuation.

In addition to charge weight and distance (which affect the cube-root
scaled distance), the following factors affect air overpressure intensity.

 - depth of burial of the charge;

 - terrain features, trees, foliage, and other screening;

 - orientation of the blast face (facing toward the recording point

increases intensity);

 - velocity of blast progression (across the face or along the surface);

 - explosive composition (elapsed time of energy release, a minor effect

that can normally be disregarded for conventional explosive products);

 - atmospheric conditions:

 - changes in barometric pressure (a minimal effect normally
disregarded), and

 - humidity (normal daily fluctuations may be disregarded, but the
difference between a very dry day and a rainy one can be quite
noticeable); and

 - temperature gradients:

 - normal or lapse conditions (temperature decreases with elevation;
sound energy is refracted upwards and the air overpressure will
attenuate at a greater rate than isothermal conditions),

 - inversion conditions (temperature decreases with elevation; sound
energy is refracted downwards and air over pressure will attenuate
at a lower rate than for isothermal conditions; a temperature
inversion has little effect in the immediate area of the blast and

usually only affects air overpressure beyond a radius equal to the
height of the inversion layer), and

 - wind direction and velocity (wind can have a major impact on air
overpressure; downwind from the blast, the overpressure will not
attenuate as rapidly as it would upwind from the blast because the
wave front and the sound energy is being refracted or bent
downward; this can add from several to as much as about 20 dB to
the overpressure).

If it is desirable to convert psi to decibels, the following formula can be
used:

_dB = 20 log ( psi / 2.9 x 10_ _[-9]_ _)_ _(Eq. 15)_

In addition to the cautions concerning charge weights and delays discussed
above, the shortest distance through the air should be used. Depending
upon terrain, this may not always be a straight line.

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

The estimation of air overpressures is more difficult than estimating
vibration due to variables that can change from moment to moment. For
this reason, allow a greater margin of error when estimating air
overpressures. Gathering data for specific sites and accurately noting
weather conditions at blast times can assist in building prediction curves
for specific operations or specific sites.

### 11.4 Criteria for Assessing Human Response to

**Blasting and Potential for Structural**
**Damage**

#### 11.4.1 Human Response

Human response to blast vibration and air overpressures from blasting is
difficult to quantify. Ground vibration and air overpressures can be felt at
levels that are well below those required to produce any damage to
structures. The duration of the event has an effect on human response, as
does the frequency. Events are of short duration, 1-2 seconds, for
millisecond-delayed blasts. Typically, the longer the event and the higher
the frequency, the more adverse the effect on human response. Factors
such as frequency of occurrence, fright or “startle factor,” level of
personal activity at the time of the event, health of the individual, time of
day, orientation of the individual (standing up or lying down), the
perceived importance of the blasting operation, and other political and
economic considerations also affect human response.

Although the duration of an event affects human response, some
researchers have found that fewer blasts of a longer duration are preferable
to many blasts with shorter durations. There would be fewer times of
perceived disturbance. Fixed locations such as quarries may be able to
take advantage of this. Construction projects, however, usually have
constraints such as smaller volumes of material to be blasted and sequence
of the work that would preclude this.

Table 21 indicates the average human response to vibration and air
overpressures that may be anticipated when the person is at rest, situated
in a quiet surrounding.


September 2013

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

Table 21. Human Response to Blasting Ground Vibration and Air Overpressure

In reviewing the above responses, one must distinguish between the
average individual and those who may reside at either end of the human
response spectrum. At one end are persons who might perceive some
financial benefit or common good from the project. Although they may
not appreciate the inconvenience of the blasting, unless they are physically
damaged in some manner, they may not complain. At the other end of the
spectrum, individuals who do not want the project to take place may be
disturbed by the slightest inconvenience and will generally make their
feelings known.

The listing of vibration levels and air overpressure levels on the same
comparison chart above does not indicate that there is any connection
between the two, except as the particular levels apply to human response.
In blasting, an increase in vibration can often be accompanied by a
decrease in air overpressures, and vice versa.

#### 11.4.2 Effect of Blast Vibration on Materials and

**Structures**

Table 22 summarizes the effects of peak particle velocities on structures
and materials that have been documented by various researchers and
organizations. The listing is intended to provide some idea of what various
particle velocities represent and the effects that might be expected. This
listing is not intended to be used to establish specific limits. In some
instances equivalent velocity levels were derived from strain

measurements.

Several valuable points can be drawn from review of Table 22 and
associated references:

 - Concrete is difficult to damage with normal construction blast

vibration, although unsupported concrete slabs can eventually crack
from their own weight. Extremely close blasts could damage concrete
from rock block movement, but this would not be considered vibratory
damage.

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

 - The average residence experiences far greater stress from daily

environmental changes than from construction blasting if blast
vibration intensities are kept at or below USBM or OSMRE limits.

 - Water wells and buried pipelines can survive rather high-vibration

intensities because they are constrained by the soil and bedding
materials surrounding them.

#### 11.4.3 Government-Published Vibration Limits

##### 11.4.3.1 U.S. Bureau of Mines

In 1974, USBM began a study to gather and update available blast
vibration data. Work was included in the area of structural and human

response to vibration. This resulted in the publishing in 1980 of USBM RI
8507, “Structure Response and Damage Produced by Ground Vibration
From Surface Mine Blasting.” Some of the conclusions contained in the
report are as follows:

 - PPV is the most practical descriptor of vibration as it applies to the

damage potential for residential structures.

 - The potential for damage to residential structures is greater with low
frequency blast vibration (below 40 Hz) than with high frequency blast
vibration (40 Hz and above).

 - The type of residential construction is a factor in the vibration

amplitude required to cause damage.

 - For low-frequency blast vibration, a limit of 0.75 in/sec for modern

drywall construction and 0.50 in/sec for older plaster-on-lath
construction was proposed. For frequencies above 40 Hz, a limit of 2.0
in/sec for all types of construction was proposed.

 - Alternative blasting-level criteria were also proposed that used the

above limits over a wide range of frequencies and included some
limits on displacement.

Figure 8 depicts the alternative blasting level criteria proposed by USBM.
(These curves also have been applied to impact rate driving vibration.)

##### 11.4.3.2 Office of Surface Mining and

**Reclamation Enforcement**

In 1983, OSMRE established regulations controlling vibration at all
surface coal mining operations. Three optional methods of limiting
vibration are allowed:

1. The first option limits PPV based on the distance to the nearest

protected structure. Each blast must be monitored by a seismograph.
With this option, velocities must be kept at or below the following
levels:

 - Distances up to 300 ft.: 1.25 in/sec

 - Distances of 301-5,000 ft.: 1.00 in/sec

 - Distances beyond 5000 ft.: 0.75 in/sec

2. The second option does not require monitoring, but requires the

operator to design his blasts utilizing Square-Root Scaled Distances
(D s ). The calculated Scaled Distances must not fall below the
following values:

 - Distances up to 300 ft.: 50

 - Distances of 301-5000 ft.: 55

 - Distances beyond 5000 ft.: 65

3. The third option requires an operator to monitor his blasts with a

seismograph and use PPV limits that vary with frequency, similar to
the alternative blasting level criteria proposed in USBM Report of
Investigations (RI) 8507. The OSMRE option differs from RI 8507 in
two areas: (1) it does not differentiate between drywall and plaster-onlath construction, allowing 0.75 in/sec in the medium frequencies for
either case, and (2) it allows a particle velocity of 2.0 in/sec down to a
frequency of 30 Hz rather than 40 Hz.

Figure 9 depicts OSMRE optional criteria. An analysis of the OSMRE
options discloses the following:

 - Option 1 is reasonable for mine-type blasts, which are usually larger

than construction blasts and generally result in larger charge weights
and lower frequencies. The nearest structures of concern are usually at
greater distances than would be expected in construction blasts where

charges are usually smaller and frequencies higher. Option 1 would be
somewhat conservative for construction blasts.

 - Option 2 is quite conservative and uses blast design criteria rather than

limiting the effects of the blast. Because no recording is required, a
larger safety factor is built into this option. Unfortunately, this option
also has the unintended effect of limiting the blaster’s use of modern
technology to improve blast efficiency while at the same time keeping
adverse effects within acceptable limits.

 - Option 3, which requires vibration recording with a capability of

determining frequencies, is a more practical limit and can be equally
applied to both mine and construction blasting.

##### 11.4.3.3 Vibration Limits for Other than

**Residential Structures**

Massive concrete structures, bridges, and other well-engineered structures
are far more capable of withstanding blast vibration intensities than
residential structures. Massive structures do not respond adversely to the
relatively high-frequency and low-displacement vibration waves that
result from nearby construction blasting. (On the other hand, the large
displacements and low frequencies encountered in earthquakes must
always be considered when designing these structures.) A PPV limit of
4.0-10.0 or 12.0 in/sec is not uncommon where the mass of a structure

precludes it from being damaged by blast vibration, and it is unusual to
find situations in which rock has been blasted away at the base of such
structures without causing damage. Blast vibration limits are best
addressed for engineered structures on a case-by-case basis.

Buried pipelines, being constrained by the bedding material and soil
surrounding them, can also withstand high-vibration intensities (Oriard
1994; Siskind and Stagg 1993). When blasting in close proximity to these
pipelines or in close proximity to most structures, rock block movement
and cracks emanating from the crater zone toward the object can become
more of a concern than vibration.

Special care should be taken when blasting in close proximity to
historically important structures. Such structures are usually of older, lesscompetent construction, and lower vibration limits for them are often
justified. These should be addressed on a case-by-case basis.

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

#### 11.4.4 Effects of Air Overpressure (Airblast)

Although the term “airblast” has been used to describe all air
overpressures from blasting, it is more correctly applied only to highfrequency air overpressures resulting from the detonation of explosives on
the surface or in the air and that result in high intensities in close
proximity to the detonation. Detonation of such charges should not have a
part in construction blasting, especially in urban settings. Air
overpressures from fully confined charges in normal down-hole blasting
are lower-frequency pressure pulses that result from movement or bulking
of the blasted material, bench-face movement, and the vertical component
of ground vibration waves in the vicinity of an air overpressure recording
device. All blasting involves expanding cases that induce a positive
pressure pulse (hence the term “overpressure”).

Overpressure at higher frequencies can be startling in a quiet surrounding,
but it will not normally cause damage unless it exceeds approximately 150
dB (linear, unweighted). Low-frequency overpressures, although they
might be below the range of human hearing, can impact the side of a
residential structure, resulting in windows rattling and other noise. On
hearing this noise, the average homeowner will not be able to distinguish
between air overpressure or ground vibration as the source but will
generally incorrectly attribute the effect to the latter.

#### 11.4.5 Government-Published Air Overpressure

**Limits**

USBM RI 8485 (1980), “Structure Response and Damage Produced by
Airblast From Surface Mining,” generally recommends a maximum safe
overpressure of 0.014 psi (134 dB, linear, unweighted) for residential
structures. The first occurrence of airblast damage is usually the breakage
of poorly mounted windows at approximately 152 dB (0.11 psi). A limit of
134 dB is sufficiently low to prevent damage but may not address the
annoyance of individuals.

OSMRE also addressed air overpressure limits in its 1983 regulations. It
considered the characteristics of the recording systems and established the
following limits:


September 2013

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

Table 23. OSMRE Overpressure Limits

 - To be used only with prior approval of OSMRE.

Most modern seismographs with air overpressure recording capability
have a frequency response of from 2-250 Hz; hence, the 133-dB limit
would be appropriate where they were used for recording.

For several years, an air overpressure limit of 140 dB was used primarily
to prevent injury to workmen’s’ hearing; it also successfully prevented
damage to structures. In recent times, lower limits have been used, mostly
in attempts to reduce annoyance.

### 11.5 Procedures for Mitigating Blast Vibration

**and Air Overpressures from Construction**
**Blasting**

Every attempt should be made to mitigate the adverse effects from
blasting on construction projects by using modern techniques, procedures,
and products. It is equally important to put in place a process to avoid and,
if necessary, deal with problems from the public that can arise from
blasting, even when the levels of vibration and air overpressure are well
below the levels at which damage to structures or excessive annoyance to
humans is expected to occur. Taking the following steps is suggested to
avoid and/or deal with potential problems from the public.

1. Identify potential problem areas surrounding the project site

2. Determine the conditions that exist prior to commencement of

construction

3. Inform the public about the project and potential blasting-related

consequences

4. Schedule the work to reduce adverse effects

5. Design the blast to reduce vibration and air over pressure

6. Use blast signals to notify nearby residents that blasting is imminent

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

7. Monitor and record the vibration and air overpressure effects of the

blast

8. Respond to and investigate complaints

Steps 1-3 are closely related. Step 1 involves determining the radius
within which a preblast survey should be conducted. Step 2 involves the
actual preblast survey. Step 3 is related to the preblast survey but
incorporates a larger radius and should be offered to all interested parties.

A blasting specification is a tool that can be used to identify blast vibration
limits, surveys, monitoring instruments, and other key methods to avoid
and minimize the effects of blasting. This chapter concludes with a
discussion of blasting specifications.

#### 11.5.1 Step 1. Identify Potential Problem Areas

**Surrounding the Project Site**

The scope of blasting anticipated for a project will be part of the process
of identifying potential problem areas. If only a very small portion of rock
would be blasted at one end of the project, for example, there may be no
need for a preblast survey of structures at the other end. Therefore, it must
be determined how far away from the proposed blasting the surveys must
be conducted. There is no standard distance that would be appropriate for
all projects or all locations.

One method of determining the preblast survey radius is to estimate the
blast vibration and survey to a radius at which the anticipated vibration
levels drop below the threshold of human detection (0.01-0.02 in/sec
PPV). This method would be economically feasible in rural areas where
such a radius might include only a few structures, but may not be
economically feasible in more densely populated areas. In a study
conducted by Caltrans (Egan et al. 2001), it was suggested that a preblast
survey radius of 100 m (328 ft.) appeared to be reasonable to take in all
structures susceptible to blast vibration damage. Any distance selected
must consider the volume of material to be blasted and the probable
charge weights to be used.

One question that must be answered before any preblast survey radius is
mandated is whether the intent is to prevent structural damage or to
prevent the perception that structural damage is occurring. Egan (2001)
notes in his study that structures beyond 35 m (115 ft.) would not have
experienced blast vibration in excess of 2.0 in/sec, the Caltrans threshold
for damage prevention at the time. Although this may have served well to


September 2013

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

prevent damage to structures, such vibration levels will usually result in
claims of perceived damage from nearby neighbors. It would not prove
excessively costly to base the preblast survey radius on preventing actual
damage, but it could be very expensive if the radius were based on
preventing human perception.

Regardless of the radius selected for preblast surveys, there have been
numerous instances in which claims of damage came from locations far
beyond the surveyed areas. Therefore, there is no reasonable standard
distance beyond which no complaints can be assured.

Bearing in mind human perceptions and economic considerations, the best
solution might be to select structures for preblast surveys as follows:

1. those structures or groups of structures closest to the blasting,

2. structures within a radius where the effects are estimated to be strongly

perceptible and,

3. any structures at greater distances that, because of historic value or

precarious condition, are deemed to deserve special attention (if the
project is viewed by the surrounding residents as not necessarily being
to their benefit or is otherwise unpopular, the distances should
probably be increased accordingly).

After a decision has been made about the limit of preblast surveys,
damage claims should be anticipated from residents in other structures that
will probably need to be resolved through forensic investigation. This is
discussed in Step 8.

#### 11.5.2 Step 2. Determine the Conditions That Exist

**Before Construction Begins**

Oriard (1999) and Dowding (1996) describe preblast survey methods in
detail. Various methods can be used to conduct preblast surveys, but all
must meet the primary purpose of documenting all defects and existing
damage in the structures concerned. Secondary purposes of preblast
surveys are to answer any questions homeowners have about the project,
and to look for anything that might require correction before construction
begins or that may unexpectedly limit blast design, such as antique plates
that are leaning against a wall or precariously balanced figurines (which
could probably be secured for the duration of the project). It is usually
advantageous to conduct postblast surveys to verify that no additional
defects have been caused by the blasting.

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

Surveys can be documented using drawings on paper, high-resolution
video, black-and-white photography, or any other method that adequately
documents existing defects and damage. It is also helpful if the possible
causes of defects can be determined and listed. All residential structures

suffer from normal shrinkage of materials, possible settling, and thermal
stresses, which start to occur soon after their construction. Both factors
can present problems on long-term projects for which relatively new
homes are included in the preblast survey. Normal shrinkage cracks and
defects might not be apparent during the preblast survey while being
apparent during a postblast inspection. To determine whether it is possible
that blasting caused the defect, the only solution is to investigate the
defects thoroughly, which will normally require an experienced forensic
investigator.

It is also good practice to examine homes both near and far from the
construction activity. If cracks or other defects are consistent throughout
the area, they are likely the result of regional settlement. Cracks or defects
that diminish with distance from the vibration source may be indicative of
effects caused by the source.

An inadequate preblast survey can be worse than no preblast survey at all;
preexisting defects not listed in the preblast survey will likely be attributed
to the blasting by the property owner. Unless such claims can be refuted
through forensic investigation, the complainant will probably be
successful. Insurance companies tend to settle smaller claims rather than
pay the costs involved in determining the actual cause. Such action is
technically and philosophically flawed, and is effectively an open
invitation for additional claims from surrounding neighbors.

Homeowners will sometimes prefer that their homes not be surveyed,
usually for the sake of privacy. A notation should be made for that
structure as to the time and date, the specific comment made, and the
person who made it. A homeowner might also terminate a preblast survey
before it is complete. Again, the survey should be annotated accordingly.

#### 11.5.3 Step 3. Inform the Public about the Project

**and Potential Blasting-Related**
**Consequences**

Establishing good public relations with those nearest the project and any
other interested parties is always beneficial. Most homeowners do not
have experience with blasting or its effects (other than spectacular events
on television) and may have concerns for the safety of themselves and
their homes.


September 2013

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

A meeting should be held and a presentation made that explains the reason
for the project, the necessity of blasting, the effects that the residents
might experience (hear and/or feel), the specific blasting signals that will
be used, and the intentions of the preblast survey. Knowledgeable persons
should attend to answer questions. A handout should be provided that
explains all of the above and includes phone numbers in case of a problem
or questions. The person or company that will conduct the preblast surveys
should be introduced. The main purpose of this meeting is to educate the
neighbors, but it also tends to put their minds at ease. Such a meeting,
conducted properly, can greatly reduce the potential for problems with
neighboring property owners.

Another opportunity to establish good public relations is the preblast
survey. The informational sheet that was used in the meeting should be
distributed in the course of the survey. The person or persons conducting
the survey should be conversant enough about the project to answer any
questions from homeowners.

Homeowners should be provided with a procedure for registering
complaints with Caltrans in the event that vibration is found to be
excessive. This procedure should identify a contact person and phone
number or email address.

#### 11.5.4 Step 4. Schedule the Work to Reduce

**Adverse Effects**

As long as safety considerations can be met, blasting should be scheduled
for times of maximum human activity rather than times of extreme quiet.
In some cases, other nearby sources of noise and/or vibration can be used
to mask construction activities. (In one case, blasting complaints on a
project near Reno were eliminated by detonating blasts only when planes
were taking off from the nearby airport. Although this is an extreme
example, it illustrates the concept well.)

In situations where only one blast is needed on a project (which are
infrequent), providing a safe viewing location and invite neighboring
residents to view the event can be beneficial. The residents will appreciate
being included and will better understand the blasting process. A safe
viewing location is key; there cannot be any chance that flyrock could
reach the spectators.

There are other considerations in scheduling blasting. A survey of the area
should disclose locations that might require close coordination. If hospitals
where surgery is conducted or other facilities with equipment highly
sensitive to vibration are nearby, coordination is necessary so that blast

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

effects do not interfere with the operations of these facilities. Also, in
areas prone to lightning storms, blasting schedules must be adjusted so
that there is minimal interruption to the work. Blasts may need to be
loaded and detonated during times when thunderstorms are not likely to

occur.

#### 11.5.5 Step 5. Design the Blast to Minimize

**Vibration and Air Overpressure**

Most of the factors involved in blast design are interrelated or interactive;
correcting one problem may prompt others. Safety is paramount. The first
consideration in blast design must be the safety of all personnel and
surrounding structures and objects.

Blast vibration is affected by the following list of variables. These are in
turn affected by blast design factors as indicated. Fixed variables, which
cannot be controlled by the blaster, are listed below.

 - **Distance:** As the distance from the blast increases, the vibration

decreases. However, the blasting must be conducted where it is
needed, and smaller charge weights may be necessary if blasting is
needed in close proximity to structures.

 - **Site geology:** As the distance between the blast and the recording

point increases, geology plays a more dominant role in determining the
frequency of the blast vibration and the speed at which the vibration
dissipates.

 - **Weather:** The blaster cannot control the weather, but can work to

avoid blasting when windy conditions might increase the intensity of
air overpressures at nearby residences.

Variables that the blaster can control are listed below.

 - **Quantity of explosive per delay:** The quantity of explosive per delay

is one of the major variables in blast design for mitigating vibration.
Blast design factors that can affect this include hole diameter and
depth, the number of explosive decks, and the method of initiation.
Generally, reducing this quantity will reduce the vibration generated,
but the powder factor must remain high enough to adequately fracture
the material (see third item in list below).

 - **Confinement of the explosive energy:** Confinement is affected by

burden and spacing, the quantity (and quality) of stemming, amount of
subdrilling, and the location of the initiating device. Highly confined


September 2013

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

blasts, such as presplitting, generate higher vibration levels per unit
weight of explosive. If a certain amount of throw or heave is
acceptable or if means are employed to prevent excessive throw,
reducing burdens can lower vibration levels appreciably. If
confinement is reduced to any great extent, one must be careful of
increased air overpressures. Bottom initiation will generally result in
slightly more vibration than top initiation. However, any vibration
benefit that might be gained from shooting from the top down or from
reducing the amount of subdrilling can be offset by any additional
blasts that may be required if the primary blast does not fracture rock
to the full depth.

 - **Powder factor:** The powder factor is affected by almost all blast

design factors. The keys are to use as close to the optimum amount of
explosive as possible and to distribute it through the material to be
blasted in such a way that it will adequately fracture and shift the
mass. If the powder factor is too low, it will not adequately fragment
the material and a large portion of the available energy will be lost as
seismic energy, resulting in excessive blast vibration. If the powder
factor is too high, it can result in flyrock and excessive air
overpressures, as well as increased vibration intensities.

 - **Explosive/borehole coupling:** Although explosive/borehole coupling

can affect vibration, the effect is minimal. For example, presplitting
uses decoupled charges (there is an annular space between the charge
and the wall of the borehole), but results in high vibration levels
because the increased burden has a greater impact than the decoupling.
Decoupling of explosive charges normally is not used to reduce
vibration.

 - **Spatial distribution of the energy source:** The spatial distribution of

the energy source can affect vibration in terms of intensity and
frequency. There are two examples of this. In the first example, two
holes separated by a reasonable distance and detonated simultaneously
will generate less vibration than one hole containing as much
explosive as the two holes combined. The resulting vibration will also
be of a higher frequency. The extent of this effect depends largely on
the separation distance between the two holes. In a second example, a
long column of explosive will generate less vibration than a spherical
charge of the same weight. Although the detonation velocity of a
column of explosive has some effect on the spatial distribution of
energy (and time of energy release), it is not usually a large enough
factor to consider in blast design. The explosive properties are usually
selected to match the rock conditions. As stated above, it is not wise to
select a low-energy explosive to reduce adverse effects if more blasts
would be needed to excavate the material to grade.

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

 - **Timing of detonating charges:** Some regulatory agencies specify a

minimum of 9 ms between detonating charges and consider all
explosives detonating in any given 8-ms period to have detonated in
the same instant; this is done solely for determining explosive weight
for scaled distance calculations and has no basis in reducing vibration.
In actual practice, while 9 ms may be used in some situations, various
delay intervals may be appropriate depending on the conditions. It is
not unusual for delay intervals of as little as 5 ms to be used in very
close-in blasting situations. When the nearest structures are at greater
distances, longer delay periods are often used. After first considering
safety issues, the blaster should try to determine a delay timing scheme
that would minimize vibration or air overpressures, although this
might not always be possible. Extending the delay time can reduce the
amount of energy released per unit of time, reducing vibration to some

extent.

 - **Timing of blast progression:** Air overpressures from blasting can be

excessive when the velocity of initiation along a free face meets or
exceeds the speed of sound; this occurs to a lesser extent on the
surface of the blast. Reducing the velocity of the blast progression
along the face to half the speed of sound reduces the effect
considerably. The delay timing must not be increased, thereby
reducing the blast progression, to the point of causing misfires through
cutoff in initiation systems or explosive columns. The blaster must
incorporate into the design a buffer zone that consists of several or
more rows of holes between a hole that is detonating and detonators in
holes in which the initiation signal has not been received. If this step is
not taken, misfires often result. Although not required, many
successful blasters prefer to use delay timing between holes in a row of
2-5 ms per foot of burden. Many also prefer to use delay timing from
row to row that is double (or nearly double) the delay timing in a row.

 - **Blast orientation:** Blast orientation is usually mandated by terrain and

the physical layout of the rock. As a general rule, the highest vibration
amplitudes will usually be in a direction opposite of that in which the
rock is being heaved or thrown, although local geology may affect the
actual direction of maximum intensity. In side-hill situations, the rock
movement would be downhill or along the side-hill, almost never
uphill. Site safety conditions will dictate the actual design, but blasting
against gravity can increase problems for flyrock and vibration.

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

#### 11.5.6 Step 6. Use the Blast Signals to Notify

**Nearby Residents That Blasting Is Imminent**

Although blasting signals were originally intended to provide a means of
clearing a blast site before the blast is detonated, they also serve to alert
nearby residents that a blast is about to occur. This helps to reduce the
“startle” effect. After hearing 5- and 1-minute warnings, the average
resident will anticipate the event and the intensities will not appear as
severe as they would have if the person had not been warned. The blasting
signals currently mandated by the California Occupational Safety and
Health Administration for blasting on construction sites are contained
under “Sample Specifications” in Appendix D.

#### 11.5.7 Step 7. Monitor and Record the Vibration

**and Air Overpressure Effects of the Blast**

Although blast-induced vibration and air overpressures can be estimated
with some confidence, monitoring and recording these effects is far more
effective. Records from blasting seismographs, when combined with the
written blaster’s report, provide excellent tools for evaluating the potential
for damage from blast-induced vibration and air overpressure. Recording
should be conducted with calibrated seismographs specifically intended
for the purpose. Such instruments include a microphone channel for
recording air overpressures; most have the ability to print a graph that
compares vibration magnitudes and frequencies against accepted national
standards.

In situations where there is considerable opposition to a project and
damage claims are anticipated, third-party monitoring should be
conducted. In situations where there is little chance for claims or where

monitoring is being done solely to ensure that specifications are being met,
the contractor might conduct his or her own monitoring. In such a case, a
third-party vibration consultant is advisable to oversee and approve the
contractor’s monitoring and recording process. Damage claims should
always be anticipated.

#### 11.5.8 Step 8. Respond to and Investigate

**Complaints**

An adequate process for handling complaints should be established.
Neighboring residents should know whom to contact with a concern or
complaint, whether or not it involves a claim of damage. In all instances, a

Transportation and Construction Vibration Guidance Manual 
September 2013

California Department of Transportation Chapter 11: Vibration and Air Overpressure from Blasting

form that documents the details of a complaint should be initiated when
the complaint is received. A sample construction/blast complaint form is
provided in Appendix B.

For minor complaints, responsible, knowledgeable contractor personnel
might conduct the investigation. A qualified forensic investigator is
advisable to look into claims of damage. The investigator could be the
same person that conducted the preblast survey, the monitoring, or both. A
prompt investigation is advisable. If the problem was caused by the
blasting, correction of the problem should also be handled promptly.

### 11.6 Blasting Specifications

Anticipation of all variables that may be encountered on various project
sites is not possible. For each project, a site-specific blasting specification
should be developed that considers the peculiarities of the project location.
In particular, the areas of blast vibration limits, preblast surveys, the
number of recording instruments and their locations, the times and days of
scheduled blasting, and cautious blasting techniques (if any) should be
addressed. A sample blasting specification has been developed to provide
a starting point for writing a blasting specification for construction
blasting; the sample is provided in Appendix D.

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

**INTRODUCTION**

This Technical Advisory is intended to give district environmental, materials, design,

construction and other concerned personnel a basic understanding of transportation

related earthborne vibrations. The advisory covers general vibration principles,

vibrations caused by construction and operation of transportation facilities, criteria

used by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), impacts, vibration

study approaches, possible mitigation, and screening procedures to identify potential

vibration problems in the field.

District personnel are usually the first to be contacted by the public when vibration

problems occur. Until 1994, the district personnel in turn contacted the Caltrans

laboratory (TransLab) and requested either an assesment of the problem or a vibration

field study. In 1994, Translab discontinued the field studies because of a

reorganization. Presently, HQ Division of Environmental Analysis, Noise, Air Quality

and Hazardous Waste Management Office, Noise and Vibration Branch is responsible

for providing guidance on potential vibration problems.

The information in this advisory will enable district personnel to participate in

assessing and screening routine vibration complaints as well as provide background

information for the oversight of more complex studies. This advisory will also be a

useful source of information for developing contract specifications and oversight.

**BACKGROUND**

Caltrans has performed earthborne vibration studies since 1958. In 1976, a landmark

TransLab vibration research report titled "Survey of Earth-borne Vibrations due to

Highway Construction and Highway Traffic", Report No. CA-DOT-TL-6391-1-76-20,

compiled a summary of results, findings, and conclusions of 23 studies completed in

the 17 year period between 1958 and 1975. Since then many more studies have been

performed. Most of these fall into the following three categories:

 - Highway traffic vibrations

 - Construction vibrations

 - Train/light rail vibrations

The main concerns of vibrations involve:

 - Annoyance

 - Damage

 - Disruption of vibration sensitive operations or activities

 - Triggering of land slides

1

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

The sites investigated included private residences, factories, aerospace and defense

plants, electronic laboratories, radio station, movie studio, etc., and even a major cake

and pastry bakery.

Because of similarities between the disciplines of noise and vibrations, the former Noise

Section took over the responsibilities for vibration studies from the Electrical

Instrumentation Testing and Research Section in July, 1980. Almost two-thirds of the

above mentioned studies were performed by the Noise Section, which, in 1994 was

absorbed by the newly created Office of Environmental Engineering of the

Environmental Program. The individual study reports are on file at the Office of

Environmental Engineering. This advisory incorporates information and experience

gained in all Caltrans vibration studies from 1958-1994.

**FUNDAMENTALS OF EARTHBORNE VIBRATIONS**

**Vibration Sources**

Sources of earthborne vibrations include natural phenomena (earthquakes, volcanic

eruptions, sea waves, landslides, etc.), or manmade causes (explosions, machinery,

traffic, trains, construction equipment, etc.). Vibration sources may be continuous

such as factory machinery, and transient, such as explosions.

A distinction must be made between earthborne and airborne vibrations. Some

sources, such as jet aircraft, rockets, explosions, sonic booms, locomotives, and even

trucks under certain conditions, can create low frequency airborne noise of enough

intensity to be felt, as well as heard. These low frequency airborne blasts or rumbles

are often erroneously perceived as earthborne vibrations.

As is the case with airborne sound, earthborne vibrations may be described by

amplitude and frequency.

**Amplitude and Frequency**

In airborne sound, amplitude is described by common logarithm of the square of the

ratio of pressure fluctuations around mean air pressure divided by a reference

pressure, and is expressed in logarithmic units of decibels. The pressure fluctuations

propagate in waves of alternating compressed and rarefied air. The rate at which these

waves radiate outward from their source is called the speed of sound, which is the wave

velocity. Air is an elastic medium through which the waves travel.

In earthborne vibrations, amplitude is described by the local movement of soil particles.

This movement must not be confused with wave velocity.

2

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

To distinguish between wave velocity and particle motion, consider the analogy of

ripples on a lake and a floating cork. Wave velocity (in air, speed of sound) is analogous

to the velocity of the ripples. Particle motion may be compared to the bobbing of the

cork as the ripples pass by. The bobbing of the cork represents the local movement of

the soil particles as earthborne vibration waves pass through the soil. The soil acts as

an elastic medium.

The amplitude of particle motion may be described three ways:

1. **Particle displacement** - the distance the soil particles travel from their original
position. Units are millimeters (mm). inches (in)

2. **Particle velocity** - the velocity of the soil particles. Units are inches per
second (in/sec) or millimeters per second (mm/sec). Sometimes expressed
logarithmically in decibels (dB) with reference to a specified unit of velocity such
as .001 in/sec (1μ in/sec), or 0.001 mm/sec.

3. **Particle acceleration** - the acceleration of the soil particles. Units are inches
per second per second (in/sec [2] ), millimeters per second per second (mm/sec [2] ),
or g-force (g = acceleration of gravity = 32.2 feet per second per second (ft/sec [2] )
= 9.81 meter per second per second (m/sec [2] ). Sometimes expressed
logarithmically in decibels (dB) with reference to a specified unit of acceleration,
such as 1 g, or 0.001g (1μg).

For a perfect sine wave produced by a single vibration frequency there exists a simple

relationship between the above three measures of amplitude (see Appendix). If the

frequency and amplitude of one descriptor is known, the other two can easily be

calculated. For waves consisting of many frequencies, and therefore not sine waves,

the relationships become much more complicated.

There is a 90 degree phase shift between the three descriptors, i.e. velocity is 90

degrees out of phase with displacement, acceleration is 90 degrees out of phase with

velocity, and acceleration is 180 degrees out of phase with displacement. To illustrate

this, we might imagine a pendulum just released from a point furthest away from its

stationary position. If we arbitrarily call this position the extreme positive (+) position of

the pendulum, the stationary point 0, and the region beyond the stationary point a

negative (-) position, we observe the following:

 - at the point of release, the displacement (distance from stationary or 0
displacement position) is maximum and positive (+).

 - the velocity at the point of release is 0.

 - the acceleration at the point of release is at its maximum, in the direction
towards the negative (-).

This can be worked out the same for other pendulum positions. For instance, as the

pendulum swings through the stationary position, the displacement is 0, the velocity is

maximum in the negative (-) direction, and the acceleration is 0. Once past the

3

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

stationary point the pendulum decelerates in the negative (-) direction which is the

same as increasing acceleration in the positive (+) direction.

Vibration amplitudes are usually expressed as either "peak", as in peak particle

velocity, or "rms" (root mean square), as in rms acceleration. The relationship between

the two is the same as with noise. The rms value is approximately 0.71 x the peak

value for a sine wave representing either displacement, velocity, or acceleration.

Finally, the direction in which vibrations are measured, analyzed or reported should be

specified (vertical, horizontal longitudinal, horizontal transverse, or the resultant of all

three motions). For example, Caltrans most often uses a peak vertical particle velocity

descriptor, because vibrations along the ground surface are most often (although not

always) greatest in the vertical direction.

**Propagation**

Propagation of earthborne vibrations is complicated because of the endless variations in

the soil through which waves propagate.

The relationship between frequency (f), period (T), wave length ( Ȝ ), and wave velocity (c)

is the same as that in noise, that is:

f=1/T and f=c/ Ȝ

However, the wave velocity (c, sometimes also called the phase velocity) in soils varies

much more than the speed of airborne sound does, and is often also frequency

dependent (in the atmoshere, the speed of sound only varies with temperature). As a

consequence, wavelength cannot readily be calculated when frequency is known and

vice versa, unless the wave velocity happens to be known also.

There are three main wave types of concern in the propagation of earthborne vibrations:

1. **Surface or Rayleigh waves**, which as the name implies, travel along the ground
surface. They carry most of their energy along an expanding cylindrical wave
front, similar to the ripples produced by throwing a rock into a lake. The
particle motion is retrograde elliptical, more or less perpendicular to the
direction of propagation.

2. **P-waves, or compression waves.** These are body waves that carry their energy
along an expanding spherical wave front. The particle motion in these waves is
longitudinal, "push-pull". P-waves are analogous to airborne sound waves.

3. **S-waves, or shear waves.** These are also body waves, carrying their energy along
an expanding spherical wave front. Unlike P-waves, however, the particle
motion is transverse, or perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

As wave fronts move outward from a vibration source, their energy is spread over an

ever increasing area. The more rapidly this area increases, the more quickly the energy

intensity (energy per unit area) decreases. The areas of cylindrical Raleigh wave fronts

4

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

do not increase as rapidly with distance as do the body (P- and S-) waves.

Consequently, the energy intensities of Raleigh waves attenuate at a lesser rate with

distance than those of body waves.

The spreading of energy over ever increasing areas is called geometric spreading

(geometric attenuation) and the difference in attenuation rates between surface and

body waves is analogous to that of line sources and point sources, respectively, in

airborne sound. Geometric attenuation also results of encountering more soil mass as

the area of the wave front increases.

Geometric attenuation is not the only attenuation encountered with distance.

Hysteretic attenuation, or material damping, results from energy losses due to internal

friction, soil layering, voids, etc. The amount of hysteretic attenuation varies with soil

type, condition, and frequency of the source.

These variations make it much more difficult to predict vibration amplitudes at specific

locations, than it is to predict noise levels.

In general, manmade earthborne vibrations attenuate rapidly with distance from the

source. Even the more persistent Rayleigh waves decrease relatively quickly.

Manmade vibration problems are therefore confined to short distances from the source.

In contrast, natural vibration problems are often wide spread. An obvious example is

an earthquake which can cause damage over large areas, due to the release of

enormous quantities of energy at longer wavelengths.

**TRANSPORTATION RELATED EARTHBORNE VIBRATIONS**

**Sources**

Caltrans is most commonly concerned with three types of transportation related

earthborne vibration sources:

 - Normal highway traffic - heavy trucks, and quite frequently buses, generate the
highest earthborne vibrations of normal traffic. Vibrations from these vary with
pavement conditions. Pot holes, pavement joints, differential settlement of
pavement, etc., all increase the vibration amplitudes.

 - Construction equipment - pile driving, pavement breaking, blasting, and
demolition of structures generate among the highest construction vibrations.

 - Heavy and light rail operations - diesel locomotives, heavily loaded freight cars,
and operations such as coupling create the highest rail traffic vibrations.

Of the above three types, construction vibrations are of greatest concern. The four

operations mentioned under construction vibrations are potentially damaging to

buildings at distances of less than 7.5 m (25 ft) from the source.

5

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

**Descriptor Used By Caltrans**

With the exception of some construction operations such as pile driving, pile hole

drilling, and perhaps some deep excavations, all vibrations generated by construction

or operation of surface transportation facilities are mainly in the form of surface or

Raleigh waves. Studies have shown that the vertical components of transportation

generated vibrations are usually the strongest and that peak particle velocity correlates

best with damage and complaints. For these reasons, Caltrans adopted the Peak

Vertical Particle Velocity descriptor, with units of mm/sec or in/sec.

A great advantage of using this descriptor is that for a frequency range of 1 - 80 Hz

damage amplitudes in terms of velocity tend to be independent of frequency. The same

is true for complaint amplitudes within a range of 8 - 80 Hz. Velocity is the product of

frequency, displacement and a constant (see appendix). It appears that within the

above frequency ranges a doubling of frequency will offset a halving of displacement

and vice versa; i.e. the effects of the product of the two tend to remain equal. Typical

transportation and construction vibrations fall within the above frequency ranges.

They typically range from 10 - 30 Hz, and usually center around 15 Hz.

From the above we can surmise that not only the effects of displacement are frequency

dependent, but also those of acceleration. The latter is related to the former by the

frequency times a constant squared (see appendix). Thus, criteria amplitudes in terms

of displacement or acceleration need to be accompanied by a frequency.

**Propagation of Transportation Related Vibration**

_**Raleigh (Surface) Wave Drop-off**_ - Surface waves generated by traffic, trains, and most

construction operations tend to attenuate with distance according to the following

equation:

V= V 0 (D 0 /D) e 0.5 Į (D0-D) (eq. 1)

where: V = Peak particle velocity at distance D
V 0 = Peak particle velocity at reference distance D 0
D 0 = Reference distance
D = Distance for which vibration amplitude needs to be calculated
e = Base of natural logarithm = 2.718281828

Į = Soil parameter

The soil parameter Į can be determined by simultaneous vibration measurements at a

minimum of two different distances from a source. One distance should be near the

source, ideally between4.5 and 7.5 m (15 -25 ft). The other should be farther away

from the source, ideally at or beyond the farthest point of interest, but at a location

where the source is still measurable and not contaminated by other vibrations. A third

6

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

point in between is recommended for confirmation. Note that the value of Į depends on

the distance units used. The reason for this is that the exponential (D 0 - D) Į needs to

be a constant value while the value of (D 0 - D) changes with the units used (normally,

m or ft). Therefore, the relationship between Į (based on m) and Į (based on ft) is:

Į (based on m) = 3.281 Į (based on ft), and
Į (based on ft) = 0.305 Į (based on m)

Į can be calculated from the vibration measurements by rewriting eq. 1 as:

Į = (lnV [2 ] + lnD - lnV 0 [2 ] - lnD 0 )/2(D 0 - D) (eq. 2)

where "ln" denotes "natural logarithm"

Once Į is calculated from the measurements it can be used in eq. 1 to calculate

vibrations for any other distance, given the same reference source.

Figure 1 shows a drop-off curve expressed as a ratio of V/V 0, using a reference distance

D 0 of 5 m (16 ft). This is a normalized curve for Į = 0.021 (distance in m), or Į = 0.006

(distance in ft), derived from data measured in the City of Lynwood to calculate Į for the

LA-105 Alameda Viaduct vibration study, involving traffic effects on Westech Gear

Corporation (formerly Western Gear) close tolerance manufacturing operations. The

attenuation curve in Figure 1 is valid for the soils stratification derived from Caltrans

boring logs for the Alameda Viaduct, shown in Table 1.

**Distance (D) from Source, m**

The curve is representative of many locations in the L.A. Basin, and also of various

locations in Sacramento, and can be used for estimating traffic, train, and most

construction vibration drop-offs with distance. To use the curve, the vibration

amplitude V 1 must be known at a given distance D 1 near the source, preferably

between 5 and 15 m (16 and 50 ft). The vibration amplitude V 2 at the distance of

interest D can then be calculated as follows:
2

V 2 = (V 2 /V 0 ) / (V 1 /V 0 ) . V 1

8

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

(the ratio’s V 2 /V 0 and V 1 /V 0 can be obtained from Figure 1)

For example, if the vibration amplitude is known to be 3.2 mm/s (peak particle velocity)

at a distance of 12 m, the vibration amplitude at 58 m can be estimated from

(0.09/0.55) x 3.2 mm/s = 0.5 mm/s.

_**Pile Driving Vibration Drop-off**_ - During pile driving, vibration amplitudes near the

source depend mainly on the soil's penetration resistance. In soils such as sand and

silt, this resistance is relatively low with the result that a large portion of the impact

energy is used to advance the pile. Less energy is then available for generating ground

vibrations. In clay soils, however, the penetration resistance is higher and more energy

is available for ground vibrations. The resistance provided by the soils consists of

friction along the sides of the pile as well as compressional resistance due to the

transfer of energy of the pile tip to the soil. This appears to generate body waves as

opposed to surface waves by other construction operations.

The energy of a pile driver is of course also influential on the vibration amplitude at the

source. There is a relationship between vibration amplitude and energy. If pile driver

energy changes from E 1 to E 2, the vibration amplitude at a certain location changes

from V 1 to V 2, where:

V = V 2 1 ( 2 ) (Eq. 3)

Example: E 1 = 68,000 J (50,000 ft lbf)

V = V

2 1 (

E 2 = 111,900 J (82,500 ft lbf)

V 1 = 2.8 mm/s

Then: V 2 = 2.8 ( [111][,][900] ) = 3.6 mm/sec

Vibrations of pile driving appear to drop off differently than the Raleigh waves, probably

due to the presence of a significant proportion of body waves. Pile driving vibrations

tend to drop off with distance according to the following equation:

V = V 0 .(D 0 /D) [k ] (Eq. 4)

where: V, V 0, D 0, and D are same as defined in Eq. 1, and
k = soil parameter (no units)

(Note that Į and k are different parameters; whereas the value of Į is dependent
on the distance units used (m or ft), the value of k - which depends only on the
ratio of distances - is independent of distance units used.)

9

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

Generally, the values of "k" lie between 1 to 1.5 (approaching 1 for sandy soils and 1.5

for clay soils), although values < 1 and > 1.5 have been encountered.

The value of "k" can be determined experimentally at different distances from a pile

driver, similarly to the previously described derivation of Į . For this purpose, Eq. 4 can

be rewritten as:

k = (LogV - LogV 0 )/(Log D 0 - LogD) (eq. 5)

**Caltrans Vibration Criteria**

There are no FHWA or state standards for vibrations. The traditional view has been

that highway traffic and construction vibrations pose no threat to buildings and

structures, and that annoyance to people is no worse than other discomforts

experienced from living near highways.

_**Damage**_ - A considerable amount of research has been done to correlate vibrations from

single events such as dynamite blasts with architectural and structural damage. The

U.S. Bureau of Mines has set a "safe blasting limit" of 50 mm/s (2 in/sec). Below this

amplitude there is virtually no risk of buiding damage.

“Safe” amplitudes for continuous vibrations from sources such as traffic are not as well

defined. The Transport and Road Research Laboratory in England has researched

continuous vibrations to some extent and developed a summary of vibration

amplitudes and reactions of people and the effects on buildings (Table 2). These are the

criteria used by Caltrans to evaluate the severity of vibration problems. Traffic, train,

and most construction vibrations (with the exception of pile driving, blasting, and some

other types of construction/demolition) are considered continuous. The "architectural

damage risk amplitude" for continuous vibrations ( peak vertical particle velocity of 5

mm/sec or 0.2 in/sec) shown in Table 2 is one tenth of the maximum “safe” amplitude

of 50 mm/sec (2 in/sec) for single events.

All damage criteria for buildings are in terms of ground motion at the buildings'

foundations. No allowance is included for the amplifying effects of structural

components. Obviously, the way a building is constructed and the condition it is in

determines how much vibration it can withstand before damage appears. Table 2

shows a recommended upper amplitude of 2.0 mm/s (0.08 in/sec) for continuous

vibrations to which "ruins and ancient monuments" should be subjected. This criterion

amplitude may also be used for historical buildings, or buildings that are in poor

condition.

Relatively little information is available concerning the damaging effects of pile driving.

Although technically a series of single events, pile driver blows occuring often enough in

a confined area could cause damage at a lower amplitude than the single event

criterion of 50 mm/s (2 in/sec). Caltrans has experienced minor damage from

sustained pile driving at about 7.5 - 9 mm/s (0.30 - 0.35 in/sec) peak vertical particle

velocity vibration on the ground next to an existing parking structure. The extent of the

damage was some crumbling of mortar used to fill wall joints. In that instance the

distance to the pile driving was slightly greater than 5 m (17 ft). The pile driver energy

and the soil conditions were unknown. It is likely that the ground vibrations were

amplified by the structure, causing the damage.

On the whole, the architectural damage criterion for continuous vibrations, 5 mm/s

(0.2 in/sec) appears to be conservative even for sustained pile driving. Pile driving

amplitudes often exceed 5 mm/s (0.2 in/sec) at distances of 15 m (50 ft), and 13 mm/s

(0.5 in/sec) at 7.5 m (25 ft). Pile driving has been done frequently at these distances

without apparent damage to buildings (with the previously mentioned exception). The

criterion amplitude for pile driving is therefore somewhere between 5 and 50 mm/s (0.2

and 2 in/sec). The 50 mm/s (2 in/sec) single event criterion is still being used by some

organizations and engineering firms as a safe amplitude for pile driving. Although

never measured by Caltrans, calculations show that this amplitude will be probably

exceeded within 2 m (6 ft) from a 68,000 J (50,000 ft lbf) pile driver. This amplitude is

probably a “safe” criterion to use for well engineered and reinforced structures. For

normal dwellings, however, pile driving peaks should probably not be allowed to exceed

7.5 mm/s (0.3 in/sec). In any case, extreme care must be taken when sustained

pile driving occurs within 7.5 m (25 ft) of any building, and 15-30 m (50-100 ft) of a

historical building, or building in poor condition.

When high amplitudes of construction vibrations (such as from pile driving, demolition,

and pavement breaking) are expected at residences or other buildings, it is

recommended that a detailed "crack survey" be undertaken BEFORE the start of

construction activities. The survey may be done by photographs, video tape, or visual

inventory, and should include inside as well as outside locations. All existing cracks in

walls, floors, driveways, etc. should be documented with sufficient detail for comparison

after construction to determine whether actual vibration damage has occurred.

 _**Annoyance**_ The annoyance amplitudes in Table 2 should be interpreted with care.

Depending on the activity (or inactivity) a person is engaged in, vibrations may be

annoying at much lower amplitudes than those shown in Table 2. Elderly, retired, or ill

people staying mostly at home, people reading in a quiet environment, people involved

in vibration sensitive hobbies or other activities are but a few examples of people that

are potentially annoyed by much lower vibration amplitudes. Most routine complaints

of traffic vibrations come from people in these categories. To them, even vibrations near

the threshold of perception may be annoying.

Frequently, low amplitude traffic vibrations can cause irritating secondary vibrations,

such as a slight rattling of doors, windows, stacked dishes, etc. These objects are often

12

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

in a state of neutral equilibrium and readily respond to very low amplitudes of

vibrations. The rattling sound gives rise to exaggerated vibration complaints, even

though there is very little risk of damage.

_**Other criteria**_ - At times, other criteria may be necessary to address very specific

concerns. For example, vibration sensitive manufacturing or calibration processes,

such as close tolerance machining, laboratories calibrating sensitive electronic

equipment, use of electron microscopes, etc. often require vibration criteria that are

much lower than the threshold of perception amplitude.

Determining the specific criterion amplitude for such sites is no easy task, and requires

the cooperation of the engineers, technicians, or managers involved with the operations.

Frequently, even those experts do not know at what amplitude of vibrations their

operations will be disturbed, and tests involving generation of vibrations (such as

running a heavy truck over 2"x4" wooden boards outside the plant), vibration

monitoring equipment, and a test operation must be performed.

**Typical Traffic Vibration Amplitudes**

From Figure 1 typical relationships of traffic vibrations vs. distance from a freeway can

be developed. For instance, vibration data of truck passbys are characterized by peaks

that are considerably higher than those generated by automobiles. These peaks last no

more than a few seconds and often only a fraction of a second, indicating a rapid drop

off with distance. Figure 1 showed that at 15 m (50 ft) from the centerline of the

nearest lane, truck vibrations are about half of those measured near the edge of

shoulder (5 m, or about 15 ft from the centerline of the near lane). At 30 m (100 ft) they

are about one fourth, at 60 m (200 ft) about one tenth, and at 90 m (300 ft) less than

one twentieth. These rough estimates are supported by years of measurements

throughout California.

Because of the rapid dropoffs with distance, even trucks traveling close together often

do not increase peak vibration amplitudes substantially. In general, more trucks will

show up as more peaks, not necessarily higher peaks. Wavefronts emanating from

several trucks closely together may either cancel or partially cancel (destructive

interference), or reinforce or partially reinforce (constructive interference) each

other, depending on their phases and frequencies. Since traffic vibrations can be

considered random, the probabilities of total destructive or constructive interference are

extremely small. Coupled with the fact that two trucks cannot occupy the same space,

and the rapid drop-off rates, it is understandible that two or more trucks normally do

not contribute significantly to each other's peaks. It is, however, good practice to try

13

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

and include the worst combinations of truck clusters with heavy loads in traffic passby

vibration measurements. This obviously requires a good view of the traffic, or an

observer who is in communication with the instrument operator.

Figure 2 is a plot of maximum highway truck traffic vibrations vs. distance from the

centerline of the nearest freeway lane. The curve was compiled from the highest

measured vibrations available from previous studies. Some of the Table 2 criteria are

also plotted, for comparison. The graph indicates that the highest traffic generated

vibrations measured on freeway shoulders (5 m from center line of nearest lane) have

never exceeded 2.0 mm/s, with worst combinations of heavy trucks. This amplitude

coincides with the maximum recommended “safe amplitude” for ruins and ancient

monuments (and historical buildings). The graph illustrates the rapid attenuation of

vibration amplitudes, which dip below the threshold of perception for most people at

about 45 m (150 ft).

Automobile traffic normally generates vibration peaks of one fifth to one tenth of truck

vibrations. Traffic vibrations generally range in frequencies from 10-30 Hz, and tend to

center around 15 Hz. However, it is not uncommon to measure lower frequencies, even

down to 1-2 Hz. Due to their suspension systems, city buses often generate low

frequencies around 3 Hz, with high velocities (indicating high displacements). It is

more uncommon, but possible, to measure frequencies above 30 Hz for traffic.

**Construction Vibration Amplitudes**

14

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

With the exception of a few instances involving pavement breaking, pile driving, all

Caltrans construction vibration measurements have been below the 5 mm/s (0.2

in/sec) architectural damage risk amplitude for continuous vibrations. The highest

measured vibration amplitude was 73.1 mm/s (2.88 in/sec) at 3 m (10 ft) from a

pavement breaker. This instance marked the only time that the single event safe

amplitude of 50 mm/s (2 in/sec) was exceeded during vibration monitoring by

Caltrans.

Other construction activities and equipment, such as D-8 and D-9 Caterpillars,

earthmovers and haul trucks have never exceeded 2.5 mm/s (0.10 in/sec) or one half

of the architectural damage risk amplitude, at 3 m (10 ft)). Depending on the activity

and the source, construction vibrations vary much more than traffic vibrations.

lbf) energy impact pile driver, for two different soils (clayey and sandy with silt). Clay

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

soils provide more resistance to advancing piles and therefore generate higher vibration

amplitudes near the source than those in sandy soils. Vibrations in clay soils, however,

tend to drop off more rapidly with distance than those in sandy soils.

Frequency ranges of construction vibrations, (including pile driving) tend to be the

same as for traffic vibrations, mostly in the 10-30 Hz range, centered around 15 Hz,

once in a while lower than 10 Hz, and rarely higher than 30 Hz.

**Train Vibration Amplitudes**

Train vibration amplitudes may be quite high, depending on the speeds, load, condition

of track, amount of ballast used to support the track, and the soil. The highest train

vibration measurement was 9.1 mm/s (0.36 in/sec) at 3 m (10 ft), in Sacramento.

Using this information with the drop-off curve in Figure 1, we can construct a train

vibration curve vs. distance. This is shown in Figure 4, beginning at 5 m (16 ft) where

the vibration amplitude is calculated at 7 mm/s. The curve represents maximum

expected amplitudes from trains, and thus is very conservative. Measurements at

various distances at other locations and different freight trains averaged about two

thirds of those shown in the curve.

Train vibrations tend to be in the same frequency ranges as traffic and construction

vibrations. In some cases higher frequencies are encountered, especially in curves,

caused by wheel chatter and squeal.

**Impacts**

_**Architectural and Structural Damage**_ - The above discussions indicate that in any

situation the probability of exceeding architectural damage risk amplitudes for

continuous vibrations from construction and trains is very low and from freeway traffic

practically non-existent. However, if vibration concerns involve pavement breaking,

extensive pile driving, or trains, 7.5 m (25 ft) or less from normal residences, buildings,

or unreinforced structures, damage is a real possibility. This may also be true if these

operations occur within 15 m - 30 m (50 ft- 100 ft) from historical buildings, buildings

in poor condition, or buildings previously damaged in earthquakes.

Pile driving in close proximity (say within 3 m or 10 feet) of structures can cause

additional problems, depending on the soils and configurations of substructures. An

example was the reconstruction of San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Toll Plaza in

June 1987. A number of piles were driven in soft clay soils (“bay mud”) close to the

existing booth access tunnel underneath the freeway. Due to the large number of piles,

and the proximity and configuration of the old substructure, the lateral soil movement,

caused by piles permanently displacing the clay, was resisted. The resulting conflict of

forces was relieved by structure uplift and damage (cracks in the reinforced concrete

tunnel).

 _**Annoyance**_ As was discussed before, the annoyance amplitude shown in Table 2 is

highly subjective, and does not take into consideration elderly, retired, ill, and other

individuals that may stay home more often than the "average" person. Nor does it

account for people involved in vibration sensitive hobbies or activities, and people that

like to relax in quiet surroundings without noticing vibrations. The threshold of

perception, or roughly 0.25 mm/s (0.01in/sec) may be considered annoying by those

people. Low amplitude vibrations may also cause secondary vibrations and audible

effects such as a slight rattling of doors, windows and dishes, resulting in additional

17

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

annoyance. Annoying low frequency airborne noise can sometimes accompany

earthborne vibrations.

_**Vibration Sensitive Operations**_ - Aerospace and electronic laboratories, close tolerance

manufacturing, calibration of sensitive instruments, radio & TV stations, recording

studios, etc., require additional attention. Shutting down their operations, even

temporarily, could be extremely costly to the state. As was previously discussed

vibration criteria for these operations are not well defined, for two main reasons. First,

the operations are often classified and their precise nature is therefore not always

known. Secondly, the engineers involved in the critical operations often do not know

how much vibration can be tolerated, or what operations they may be involved with in

the future.

Heavy truck traffic on freeways within 30 m (100 ft), major construction within 60 m

(200 ft), freight trains within 90 m (300 ft) and pile driving within 180 m (600 ft) may be

potentially disruptive to sensitive operations.

**Mitigation**

Unlike with noise, there are no easy ways to mitigate earthborne vibrations. There are,

however, a limited number of options available.

When designing new transportation facilities, reasonable amounts of care should be

taken to keep these facilities away from vibration sensitive areas.

When dealing with existing transportation facilities, obvious vibration causes, such as

pot holes, pavement cracks, differential settlement in bridge approaches or individual

pavement slabs, etc., may be eliminated by resurfacing. In certain situations a ban of

heavy trucks may be a feasible option.

The use of alternate construction methods and tools may reduce construction

vibrations. Examples are predrilling of pile holes, avoiding cracking and seating

methods for resurfacing concrete pavements near vibration sensitive areas, using

rubber tired as opposed to tracked vehicles, placing haul roads away from vibration

sensitive areas.

Scheduling construction activities (particularly pile driving) for times when it does not

interfere with vibration sensitive operations (e.g. night time) may be another solution,

especially in industrial areas.

Train vibrations may be reduced by using continuous, welded rails, vibration damping

pads between rails and ties, and extra ballast.

18

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

**Link With Historical Data**

A considerable amount of effort has gone into the field measurements, reduction,

documentation and reporting of vibration data since 1958. As data sets are

accumulated with each vibration study, a more complete picture emerges of the

generation and propagation of vibration waves under various conditions of geometry,

soil, and source types.

Due to the lack of accurate subsurface information, empirical data is of utmost

importance and can be used for future estimates when conditions are alike. Historical

data that can be linked to the present and future play a very important role in

estimates and predictions of future vibrations.

Present and future personnel charged with the responsibility of performing vibration

studies and maintaining vibration files should make every effort necessary to maintain

a good correlation between any new and old instrument systems, calibration

procedures, and measuring methods. The link between present and valuable historical

data must be preserved.

**Vibration Monitoring Equipment**

During the period of 1958 - 1994 all of Caltrans vibration monitoring was performed by

Translab. A transducer calibration system consisting of a shake table mounted on a

concrete vibration isolation pad, and an Optron camera/amplifier system, measuring

displacement allowed Translab to calibrate its own transducers with traceability to the

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), formerly known as the National

Bureau of Standards (NBS). Transducers were calibrated by mounting them on the

shake table and running the latter at a known frequency and displacement.

Two types of sensors (transducers) were used by Caltrans. The first type was the

seismometer. A seismometer measures vibrations at relatively low frequencies usually

1 - 200 Hertz (Hz), is very sensitive to low amplitudes of vibrations and, through

magnetic induction produces a voltage proportionally to velocity. It measures velocity

directly via a signal conditioner, and is therefore called a velocity transducer. It is

large, weighs about 7 kg (15 lbs), and, because of its mass, can be placed directly on

the ground without further mounting attachments.

The second type of transducer was an accelerometer. As the name implies, this type

of transducer measures acceleration directly. Used with an integrator it can also

measure velocity and displacement.

19

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

The type of accelerometer used by Caltrans has a piezoelectric (pressure sensitive)

crystal. As the transducer vibrates with the surface it is mounted on, acceleration

changes the compression of the crystal, which in turn causes variations in the electrical

charge across the crystal faces. These charge variations are proportional to

acceleration.

An accelerometer is small, not as sensitive as the seismometer and has a wide

frequency range, from 1 Hz to several KHz (1 KHz = 1000 Hz). Larger, more sensitive

accelerometers, weighing about 1 lb, are available with a narrower frequency range

from 0.1 Hz to 1KHz. Due to their small size and lack of mass, accelerometers should

not be placed directly on the ground, floor, or other vibrating surface without proper

mounting. When properly mounted, accelerometers are excellent transducers for

vibration monitoring. They can be mounted various ways, depending on the surface.

For earthborne vibration work an accelerometer can be mounted via a magnet (supplied

with it) to a block of steel of, say 5-10 kg (10-20 lbs). The steel block can then be

placed directly on the ground, or other surface. However, the steel block should be

firmly embedded in loose soil. On harder surfaces such as pavements, the block can

only be used on friction surfaces that are perfectly amplitude without high spots to

avoid rocking of the block. Correlation tests conducted by Caltrans using this method

and the heavy seimometers, concluded that the mass of the steel block provided

adequate coupling of the accelerometer with the ground for the low frequency, low

amplitude vibrations generated by transportation facilities and construction.

**Vibration Study Approach and Instrument Setup**

Vibration studies can be classified into two main categories:

1. Studies involving existing transportation operations and facilities
2. Studies involving future transportation operations and facilities

 _**Vibration Studies for Existing Construction Operations and Transportation Facilities**_

These studies consist of mainly addressing vibration complaints due to existing traffic,

or construction operations. Understandably, pile driving near homes or businesses will

normally generate many noise and vibration complaints. Other construction operations

can also be responsible. Traffic vibration complaints are often due to poor pavement

conditions. Other reasons may be increases in traffic, heavy trucks, buses, etc.

Sudden increases in traffic vibrations may be due to opening of new transportation

facilities, or redirecting traffic.

Although complaints can originate from the entire spectrum of receptors, most are from

residences, or businesses that have vibration sensitive equipment or operations.

20

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

The first step in investigating complaints should be interviewing the complainant(s).

The screening procedures outlined later in this document cover the most important

questions to ask. For the purposes of performing a vibration study, the most important

issues are:

- The type and location of the vibration source(s)

- The complainant(s)' concerns, i.e., annoyance, damage, disruption of operations.

- The location that is most sensitive, or where vibrations are most noticeable.

Vibration monitoring of existing operations or facilities ranges from simple, single

location measurements to more complex multi-instrument, simultaneous

measurements. The former consists of taking measurements at the most sensitive

location, or location perceived by the complainant to have the worst vibrations. The

latter usually involves placing a sensor close to the source as a reference, and one or

more sensors at the critical location(s) ("response sensors"). Simultaneous

measurements will then positively identify the vibration source, the drop-off and the

response (vibration amplitude) at the location(s) of interest. The reference sensor

remains fixed in one location near the source, while the response sensor(s) may be

moved to different locations.

Sufficient data should be collected for each location. For highway traffic vibrations, 10

passbys of heavy trucks (preferably worst case combinations of several trucks) for each

location should be sufficient. For pile driving, at least one pile closest to the receptor

should be monitored at each location of interest.

The highest vibration amplitude at each location can then be compared to Caltrans or

other appropriate criteria.

 _**Vibration Studies for Future Construction Operations and Transportation Facilities**_

Studies involving predictions of construction and operation vibrations of future

transportation facilities often require vibration simulations to determine a site-specific

drop-off curve. In order to generate vibrations that can still be measured at 60-90 m

(200 to 300 ft) to develop the curve, the site must be free of high ambient vibrations

(preferably less than 0.13 mm/s or 0.005 in/sec at the 90 m or 300 ft distance), and

the generated vibrations must be relatively high. From Figure 1 we can calculate

approximately how high the reference vibration V 0 at 5 m should be to detect the

vibrations at 90 m. The V/V 0 ratio at that distance = 0.038; assuming we want V to be

at least 0.13 mm/s; then V 0 = 1/0.038 x 0.13 = 3.4 mm/s (0.13 in/sec). If a low

vibration site cannot be found, either the distance for the drop off curve must be

shortened, or the reference vibrations increased. Caution must be used to apply the

21

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

drop-off curve to pile driving projections, due to the previously discussed differences in

propagation characteristics.

To generate data for the drop-off curve, a heavily-loaded water truck, or dump truck

(preferably 25 tons or greater GVW) is run at high speed over 2" x 4", or 2" x 6" wooden

boards. Normally, five boards are laid perpendicular to the direction of travel, and

spaced 7.5 m (25 ft) apart along the direction of travel. The advantage of this

arrangement is that the generated vibration "signature" is normally recognizable at 90

m (300 ft).

A minimum of two sensors must be used simultaneously: one reference sensor, and

one or more response sensors. The reference sensor remains fixed at 5 m (16 ft) from

centerline of travel, (or any convenient distance near the source) opposite the last board

to be run over (most forward in line with the direction of travel). The response sensor(s)

is (are) positioned at various distances away from the source. Because of the steepness

of the curve near the source it is a good idea to cover shorter distance intervals near the

source and longer ones away from the source. To adequately cover the entire range of

the drop-off curve, 6 to 8 locations must be monitored, and at least 5 truck passbys per

location.

Frequently it is not possible to do the simulations on the site of interest, because of

space limitations. Nearby empty lots or open fields, or data from other sites known or

judged to have similar soil conditions can then be used.

Once the measurements have been made, the data at each location should be averaged.

Using the reference location, and at least two others (including the furthest one), the

soil parameter “ ǂ ” can be calculated using equation 2. Ideally, “ ǂ ” should remain

constant for each location, but in reality it will vary. The average of several values can

then be used to develop a drop-off curve. The vibration amplitudes at all measured

locations should then be plotted to determine how well they fit this curve. Assuming

they fit reasonably well, a normalized drop-off curve using V/V 0 ratios and distances

(similar to Figure 1) can then be developed and used with any source reference

amplitude, to predict the future amplitude at any distance within the range of the

curve.

If it is possible to do the simulations at the site, inside/outside building locations

should be included to measure the building amplification or attenuation ratio.

The next step is to measure ambient amplitudes at the site. Outside as well as inside

building locations should be included for these measurements.

22

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

Using all the above information, future amplitudes can be predicted and compared to

existing ambient amplitudes, Caltrans guidelines, or any other appropriate or required

standard.

Concerns for vibrations of future transportation facilities are usually raised by vibration

sensitive factories, laboratories, or other vibration sensitive sites. Unless construction

activities are expected to occur very close to residential or other structures, or near

historical buildings, these receptors are not routinely included in vibration studies for

future facilities.

Vibration field studies including simulations are expensive. Unless the consequences

of transportation and construction generated vibrations may be costly to Caltrans, the

curves and techniques described in this document can be used to estimate "ball park"

vibration amplitudes, in lieu of field studies.

**Vibration Reports**

Each vibration field study should be documented in a report. Depending on the

amount of sites measured, amount of data collected, methodologies used, and the

importance of the study, the report may range from a simple one or two paged memo, to

a report of twenty or more pages. A vibration study can be considered a mini-research

project, and should contain enough information for the reader to independently come to

the same conclusions.

As a norm, vibration reports contain the following topics, which will be described in

greater detail:

 - Project title and description

 - Introduction

 - Objectives

 - Background

 - Study Approach

 - Instrumentation

 - Measurement Sites

 - Measurements

 - Data Reduction

 - Measurement Results

 - Data Analysis

 - Results and Comparison with Standards

 - Conclusions and Recommendations

 - Tables showing all measured data, summaries of
results, analysis and standards

 - Figures showing site layouts and cross sections,
instrument setups, drop-off curves, and other
pertinent illustrations

 - References cited

23

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

In short, simple vibration studies, the topics may be described in a few sentences in a

memo. In more complex studies, a fairly extensive report is usually required.

_**Project Title and Description**_ - If the report consists of a short memo this info. can be

put in the "Subject:" space. In a long report it should be put on a separate title page,

with the date, who did the study (Div.or District, Branch, and personnel involved), and

author of report.

_**Introduction**_ - Typical opening sentences: "This report (memo) presents the results of a

vibration study at ........ The study was requested by ......, in response to concerns by

............. that vibrations of ........ would interfere with ..........operations. The study was

performed by ..... (branch or section) on ....... (dates)."

_**Objectives**_ - This is often combined with the introduction. Example: "The purpose of the

study was to provide baseline data for estimating vibration amplitudes in sensitive

areas of Hughes Aircraft facility generated by construction and traffic of the proposed

LA-105 Freeway."

_**Background**_ - Used only when there is a long and complicated history connected with

the reasons for the studies. Useful for documenting all the facts leading up to the

study for litigation purposes. Dates first contacted, correspondence, actions taken, and

other pertinent details may be appropriate in this section. Not necessary in most

studies.

_**Study Approach**_ - May be combined with other sections. A short description of how the

study was done. Example:

"First, vibrations generated by a 25 ton GVW three-axle water truck driven over five

2"x4" wooden boards ........ were measured at various distances to measure the

vibration attenuation with distance. This info. was then used to develop a drop-off

curve....., etc." For simple studies, such as residential complaints: "The sensor was set

up at four different locations where, according to the homeowner, vibrations were most

noticeable. Five heavy truck passbys on Route ..... were measured at each of the

locations. ..."

_**Instrumentation**_ - Always include description, manufacturer, model, serial no. of each

vibration equipment components used. It is also extremely important to include the

date instruments were last calibrated, by whom, where the records are on file, and

whether calibration was traceable to the NIST (National Institute of Standards and

Technology, formerly NBS). Essential in court cases!

24

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

_**Measurement Sites**_ - Include a sketch, preferably to scale, of the relationship between

source and measurement locations. Plot and number the sites on the sketch. Include

typical cross sections if there are significant elevation differences between source and

receptors. Plot significant structures. Show enough dimensions to pinpoint each

measurement location. Show detailed descriptions, and instruments or sensors used at

each location in the text, or in a separate table if there are many. Once locations are

numbered and described, they can be referred to by number only.

_**Measurements**_ - This section may also include the study approach. Basically explains

the methods used, how sensors were mounted, number of measurements taken, what

sources were measured (e.g. heavy trucks on Route 5), descriptor used and why, and

other pertinent information concerning the vibration measurements. When possible,

include a description of soil type and structure. This info. can often be extracted from

nearby boring logs. Be sure to include ambient or background measurements.

_**Data Reduction**_ - A short description of how the data was reduced can effectively be

combined with the measurement section. Only if the reduction method is unusual or

complex should it be discussed in a separate section.

_**Measurement Results**_ - May also be combined with the measurement section. Briefly

summarize data in the text by giving highest values, ranges, and averages. Should be

accompanied by a table summarizing measurement run No. (or just Run No.), date and

time, measurement location, source (heavy truck in N/B lane No.4), distance, vibration

amplitude, dominant frequency, and optional remarks. This table may be put in the

text or in an appendix with all other tables and figures. All individual measurements

should be included as part of the report, for possible future use. Ambient or

background vibration measurements can be expressed as a range of vibrations, typical

frequency ranges, time period during which they were measured, and if possible the

range of sources and distances.

 _**Data Analysis**_ Developing drop-off curves, predicting future amplitudes, calculating

amplitudes at specific distances not measured, etc. all should be in this section. May

not be necessary for simple studies involving residential complaints, monitoring for

compliance with a standard, or any other study involving vibration measurements only.

 _**Results and Comparisons to Standards**_ Existing measured, projected, and predicted

vibration amplitudes and frequencies are summarized and compared to pertinent

standards in this section. This is usually done in tabular form, and accompanied by

Table 1, which shows the vibration criteria used by Caltrans.

25

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

_**Conclusions and Recommendations**_ - Conclusions are drawn from the previous

comparisons with standards. Typically for highway vibration complaints would be:

"Although vibrations generated by heavy trucks on I-5 may at times be felt, they are far

below the 'architectural damage risk amplitude' criterion of 0.2 in/sec used by

Caltrans."

Recommendations for mitigation are rather limited (see "Mitigation" section). However,

in some cases strategies such as pile driving at night may solve interference with

vibration sensitive manufacturing processes during day time. When ever possible, such

recommendations should be included.

_**References**_ - In complex reports, relying partly on previously gathered data, it may be

beneficial to cite other reports or references by number. A listing of these references

should then be included at the end of the report.

**Field Review and Screening of Possible Vibration Problems**

The following procedures were designed to screen vibration complaints near existing

transportation facilities. They are intended to accomplish two things: 1) to evaluate the

severity of the vibration problem, and 2) obtain preliminary information for a vibration

study, should one be necessary.

The procedures are divided in two parts: problem definition and actions to take. An

outline of the steps in each part follows:

**I. Problem Definition**

A. Interview resident at the site of concern. Ask the following questions:

1. What is the exact problem in the resident's opinion?

Many people confuse low frequency airborne noise with earthborne vibrations.

2. What are the sources in the resident's opinion?

Trucks on freeway?; city traffic?; trains? (sources may not be our jurisdiction.)

3. What are the specific concerns?

Annoyance?, interference with activities?, damage to the residence? If damage
is the main concern, ask for evidence look for stucco cracks, cracks in
driveways, walkways, walls, stucco, etc. Compare with other residences further
away from the transportation facility. If these also have cracks, then it is safe to
assume that the facility is not responsible.

4. Where are the vibrations most noticeable?

Which room?; which part of the yard? (Let resident point out the critical
locations.)

5. What time of the day and/or what day of the week does the resident feel
vibrations the most?

26

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

6. When did the resident become aware of the vibrations?

Try to correlate with changes in nearby traffic patterns, due to truck bans
elsewhere, new industrial development, or other reason for truck increases.

B. Feel the vibrations

1. Stand at critical locations and try to feel vibrations when trucks pass by.

Place finger tips on furniture, walls, uncarpeted floor, ground outside the
residence, patio floor, etc.

2. Have someone walk nearby; feel these vibrations and compare with the traffic

 vibrations. Also compare other in house generated vibrations.

Walking, air conditioners, heater blowers, and garbage disposals, etc. often
generate more vibrations than traffic.

3. Stand on freeway shoulder, sidewalk next to highway, or anywhere close to
the suspect source. Feel vibrations and compare with those felt at the receptor.

Place finger tips on ground or pavement surface.

4. Look for obvious causes of excessive vibrations.

Pot holes, pavement joints, sag, and pavement cracks, or anything that could
cause above normal vibrations; also look for drainage or other structures
transmitting vibrations to the receptor without benefit of soil attenuation.

C. Evaluate severity of the problem.

The graphs in Figures 1 - 4 show typical vibration attenuations with distance for

various sources. Use these to evaluate typical relationships of near and far

source vibration amplitudes. If vibrations appear to dropoff at a significantly

lesser rate, then suspect that something unusual is going on. For instance,

vibrations may be transmitted by underground structures, which can cause

problems at the receptor.

1. If vibrations feel as strong (or almost as strong) at the receptor as they do
near the source (such as on a freeway shoulder), consider problem severe.

2. If vibrations at the receptor are readily noticeable and appear to interfere
with activities or vibration sensitive operations, consider problem severe.

3. If vibrations of any amplitude are an issue in litigation, consider the problem

severe.

4. If after this screening procedure uncertainty still exists, consider problem

severe.

**II. Actions To Take**

A. If problem is not severe:

1. If there are obvious causes for excessive vibrations, such as pot holes, etc.,
contact Maintenance or other departments and find out if scheduled for repair
or resurfacing.

2. Write memo to resident explaining your findings.

27

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

If there are obvious solutions such as patching or resurfacing, tell the resident.
If there are no obvious solutions, explain to the resident that although
vibrations may be felt, they are not damaging. Use background info. in this
document.

B. If problem is considered severe, or if the resident keeps insisting on actual

monitoring, consider contracting out vibration monitoring or a complete vibration

study.

A g [= Zero-to-Peak, or Peak Acceleration (Units: "g" = acceleration of gravity), where: ]

1 g = 9.807 m/sec [2]

**Formulae for Sinusoidal Waves**

Units need to be consistent; for example, if D is in mm, then V must be in mm/sec, and

A either in mm/sec [2 ] or units of "g" (9807 mm/sec [2] ).

With displacement, we are normally interested in the peak-to-peak value or in other

words, the total displacement (distance between the + peak and - peak) soil particles

travel. Sometimes, however we may also be interested in the zero-to-peak

displacement, or displacement relative to a stationary (zero) reference position. For

sinusoidal waves, the + side of reference and the - side are symmetrical, and zero-to

peak values are D/2.

With velocity and acceleration, however, we are always interested in the zero-to-peak

values. These give an indication of maximum value, without regard of the direction.

Acceleration is most commonly used in units of g.

Following are formulae expressing the relationships between displacement, velocity,

and acceleration for sinusoidal vibration waves.

30

_Technical Advisory, Vibration_ _TAV-04-01-R0201_

**Velocity and Displacement:**

V = 2 ʌ f(D/2) (Eq.A-1)

V = ʌ fD (Eq.A-2)

D/2 = V/(2 ʌ f) (Eq.A-3)

D = V/( ʌ f) (Eq.A-4)

**Acceleration and Displacement:**

A = (2 ʌ f) [2] (D/2)

A = 2 ʌ [2] f [2] D

A g = ( 2 ʌ [2] f [2] D )/ g

(Eq.A-7)

If D is in inches:

A g = (2 ʌ [2] f [2] D)/386.102 = 0.0511f [2] D (Eq.A-8)

If D is in mm:

A g = (2 ʌ [2] f [2] D)/9807 = 0.00201f [2] D (Eq.A-9)

**Acceleration and Velocity:**

A = 2 ʌ fV (Eq.A-10)

A g [= (2 ] [ʌ] [ fV)/g ] (Eq.A-11)

If V is in inches per second:

A g = (2 ʌ fV)/386.102 = 0.0163fV (Eq.A-12)

If V is in mm per second:

A g = (2 ʌ fV)/9807 = 0.000641fV (Eq.A-13)

**Acceleration or Velocity in Decibels:**

A(dB)= 20Log(A/A 0 ); V(dB) = 20Log(V/V 0 ) (Eq.A-14)

where A = acceleration, A 0 = reference acceleration,

V = velocity, and V 0 = reference velocity (units must be consistent)

_This page intentionally left blank_

Vibration Screening Procedure

The vibration screening procedure is divided in two parts: problem definition and actions to take.

**I. Problem Definition**

A. Interview resident at the site of concern. Ask the following questions.

_1. What is the exact problem, in the resident’s opinion?_

Confirm that the vibration is from a Caltrans facility or activity and that vibration is
really the issue. Many people confuse low frequency airborne noise with earthborne
vibrations.

_2. What are the sources of vibration, in the resident’s opinion?_

Identify the sources of vibration (e.g., trucks on freeway, city traffic, trains, construction
equipment). Sources such as trains may not be within Caltrans’ jurisdiction.

_3. What are the specific concerns?_

Identify the specific concern (e.g., annoyance, interference with activities, damage to the
residence). If damage is the main concern, ask for evidence and look for cracks in
driveways, walkways, walls, stucco, etc. Compare these conditions with other
residences farther away from the transportation facility or construction activity. If
distant locations have similar conditions, it is likely that the damage is not the result of
the facility or construction activity.

_4. Where is the vibration most noticeable?_

Identify where the vibration is most noticeable (e.g., specific rooms, yard outside). Let
resident point out the critical locations.

_5. What time of the day and what day of the week does the resident feel vibrations the_
_most?_

Identify when the vibration is most noticeable.

_6. When did the resident become aware of the vibrations?_

Try to correlate the detection of vibration with changes in nearby traffic patterns,
changes in heavy truck percentages, or the presence of new vibration sources.

B-1

B. Feel the vibrations.

_1. Stand at critical locations and try to feel vibrations when trucks pass by._

Place fingertips on furniture, walls, uncarpeted floor, ground outside the residence, patio
floor, etc., to sense where vibration is most noticeable.

_2. Have someone walk nearby; feel these vibrations and compare with the traffic_
_vibrations. Also compare other vibrations generated in-house._

People walking, air conditioners, heater blowers, garbage disposals, etc. often generate
more vibrations than traffic. Try to see how vibration from these sources compares to
vibration from the sources identified by the resident.

_3. Stand on freeway shoulder, sidewalk next to highway, or anywhere close to the_
_suspected source. Feel vibrations and compare with those felt at the receptor._

Place fingertips on ground or pavement surface to sense vibration near the source of

concern.

_4. Look for obvious causes of excessive vibrations._

Identify potholes, pavement joints, sag, pavement cracks, or anything that could cause
above-normal vibration. Also look for drainage pipes or other structures that can
transmit vibration directly to the receptor without benefit of soil attenuation.

C. Evaluate the severity of the problem.

If the vibration level appears to drop off at a significantly lower rate than would be
expected, something unusual may be occurring on the site. For example, vibration may be
transmitted by underground structures, which can cause vibration to be transmitted over
longer-than-normal distances. A vibration problem should be considered severe if:

1. vibration feels as strong (or almost as strong) at the receptor as it does near the source
(such as on a freeway shoulder),

2. vibration at the receptor is readily noticeable and appears to interfere with activities or
vibration-sensitive operations,

3. vibration at the receptor is readily noticeable and appears to have resulted in structural
or cosmetic damage,

4. vibration of any amplitude is an issue in litigation, or

B-2

5. uncertainty still exists as to the source of vibration.

**II. Actions to Take**

A. If problem is not severe:

_1. Identify the obvious causes for excessive vibrations._ These causes could include
pavement imperfections that result in vibration from truck pass-bys or unusual building
resonances that amplify vibration at the receiver. For issues within Caltrans’ control,
such as pavement conditions, contact the appropriate Caltrans department and find out
whether the pavement is scheduled for repair or resurfacing.

_2. Prepare a memo to explain your findings._ If there are obvious solutions, such as
pavement patching or resurfacing, explain these, along with actions that will or will not
be taken to address the issue. If there are no obvious solutions, explain that, although
vibration may be felt, it is not enough to cause damage.

B. If problem is considered severe, or if the resident keeps insisting on actual monitoring,

conduct a vibration monitoring study to further investigate the issue.

## Appendix D. Sample Blasting Vibration Specifications

_This page intentionally left blank_

**Sample Blasting** **Specifications**

It is impossible to foresee all of the variables that may be encountered on various project sites. A
site-specific Blasting Specification should be developed for each project that takes into
consideration the peculiarities of that project location. In particular, the areas of blast vibration
limits, pre-blast surveys, the number of recording instruments and their locations, the times and
days of scheduled blasting, and cautious blasting techniques (if any) should be addressed.

Considering the foregoing, the following represents a generic blasting specification that provides
a starting point for writing a blasting specification for construction blasting.

1. GENERAL

All blasting operations on this project, including the storage, on-site transportation,
loading and firing of explosives, shall be in strict compliance with this section.

2. PERMITS AND LICENSES

A. All blasting operations shall be conducted under the direct supervision of a blaster
holding a current license issued by the California Division of Occupational Safety and
Health (CALOSHA). The class of license held by the blaster shall include the type of
blasting that is to be accomplished. Prior to commencing blasting operations, a copy of
the Blaster's License shall be provided to the Engineer.

B. The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining any explosives or blasting permits
that may be required by state or local laws.

3. STORAGE OF EXPLOSIVES

Storage of explosives, if anticipated, shall comply with the applicable provisions of
CALOSHA's Construction Safety Orders and with Title 27 CFR 181, Part 55, Subpart K,
Commerce in Explosives. Adequate magazine records shall be maintained for stored
explosives.

4. TRANSPORTATION OF EXPLOSIVES

A. Transportation of explosives to the project site shall be in accordance with current
Federal Department of Transportation and California Highway Patrol regulations.

B. Transportation of explosives on the project site shall comply with provisions of the
CALOSHA Construction Safety Orders.

D-1

5. BLASTING OPERATIONS

A. All blasting operations shall be conducted in compliance with the CALOSHA
Construction Safety Orders and the provisions of this Section.

B. The time and date of blasting shall be coordinated in advance with the Engineer in
order to minimize the impact on traffic and nearby residents.

C. Due to the potential presence of RF emitting devices in the vicinity, only initiation
systems that are not affected by stray current or RF energy shall be utilized. Initiation
systems consisting solely of cap and fuse shall not be used. Procedures in the use of the
initiation system selected shall conform to the system manufacturer's recommendations.
Regardless of other exclusions in this section, if deemed safe by the Contractor, an
electric detonator may be utilized to start the initiation system. The electric cap or other
starter shall not be brought onto the blast site nor shall it be connected to the initiation
system until the area has been cleared and the blast is ready to be detonated.

D. Before commencing loading operations, warning signs shall be posted at points of
access to the blasting site. Only the blaster, his loading crew and necessary supervisory
personnel shall be allowed within 50 feet of the blast site during loading.

E. Only a reasonable quantity of explosives for each blast shall be brought to the blast
loading site. When loading is complete, all excess explosive materials shall be removed
from the site and returned to the storage magazine or the supplier's storage facility. In no
instance shall explosives, blasting agents, detonators or loaded holes be left unguarded or
unattended.

F. A lightning detector of a type approved by CALOSHA shall be utilized to detect the
presence of lightning immediately prior to and during blast loading operations. Prior to
commencing loading operations, if an electrical storm is detected whose approach is
estimated to interfere with loading operations, loading shall not commence and the blast
shall be rescheduled. If an approaching electrical storm is detected during loading that
will present a hazard to loading operations, loading shall be discontinued and all
personnel moved to a safe area. All approaches to the blast site shall be guarded and no
one shall be allowed to return to the blast site until the storm has passed safely out of

range.

G. All refuse from explosives loading such as empty boxes, bags, plastic, paper and
fiber packing shall be removed from the project site and destroyed in accordance with the
provisions of the Construction Safety Orders.

H. Prior to firing a blast, all personnel shall be cleared to a safe distance and all
approaches to the blast site shall be guarded. Traffic shall be stopped at a safe distance

D-2

and held until the all-clear signal. The blaster firing the blast shall be in a position where
he can see the blast site and approaches and shall not detonate the blast until he is certain
that no one remains in a hazardous location.

I. Blasting signals shall be conspicuously posted at the site. The signaling device shall
be sufficiently loud so that the signals can be heard throughout the area to be cleared.
The following blasting signals shall be used:

WARNING SIGNAL
5 minutes prior to the blast...a 1-minute series of long signals

BLASTING SIGNAL
1 minute prior to the blast.....a series of short signals

ALL-CLEAR SIGNAL
Following inspection of the blast....a prolonged signal

J. Misfires.

1. After the blast has been fired, an inspection shall be made by the blaster to
determine that all charges have detonated. Only after the blaster is satisfied that
the area is safe shall the ALL-CLEAR signal be given.

2. If, after a blast has been fired, the blaster suspects that a misfire has occurred,
the Engineer shall be notified. The ALL CLEAR signal shall NOT be given,
traffic shall not be released and the blast site shall continue to remain guarded.
The blaster shall be in charge of investigating the misfire. He shall do so in
accordance with the Construction Safety Orders.

3. If no misfire is found to exist after adequate inspection by the blaster, he shall
so notify the Engineer and the ALL CLEAR signal can be sounded.

4. If a misfire is found to exist, the blaster shall immediately notify the Engineer
and he shall then proceed to clear the misfire. While this is being accomplished,
the blast site shall remain guarded.

5. Following the successful clearing of the misfire and a subsequent inspection of
the blast site by the blaster, he shall give the order to sound the ALL CLEAR
signal.

D-3

6. BLAST DOCUMENTATION (BLAST REPORT)

A. At least 24 hours prior to the loading of a blast, the Contractor shall submit to the
Engineer a copy of the proposed blasting scheme for that particular blast. As a minimum,
the Blast Report shall include:

1. A plan view of the blast showing the number and location of all holes.

2. The hole diameter(s) and depth(s).

3. The burden and spacing dimensions.

4. The type(s) of explosive to be used and the anticipated total quantity of each.

5. The quantity of explosive to be loaded in each hole and in each deck if decking
of charges is anticipated.

6. The type and depth(s) of stemming material to be used.

7. The type, layout and timing of the initiation system to be used.

8. The method of starting the initiation system.

9. The maximum quantity of explosive that will be detonated within any 8
millisecond time period during the blast.

10. The name of the licensed blaster and his license number.

B. It is anticipated that minor changes could be necessary during loading of the blast due
to lost holes, etc. Immediately following the blast, the blaster shall annotate a copy of the
Blast Report with such changes, if any, and shall sign the Report and deliver it to the
Engineer.

7. PROTECTION OF NEIGHBORING FACILITIES

A. The Contractor shall conduct his blasting operations in a manner that will preclude
his causing damage to neighboring facilities. Compliance with the provisions of these
specifications or acceptance by the Engineer of any blasting procedures or techniques
shall not absolve the Contractor from full responsibility for any damage that may result
from his blasting operations.

B. Blasts shall be designed so that vibration and air overpressure levels and flyrock do
not exceed the limits stated in this Section.

D-4

C. All blasts shall be monitored by the Contractor with (qty) blast vibration
seismograph(s). Each seismograph shall record blast-generated vibration in three
mutually perpendicular axes and have a frequency response range of from 2 to 250 Hertz.

D. The seismograph(s) shall have received a factory calibration within the 12 month
period preceding the blast recorded. Each seismograph shall produce a real-time
graphical depiction of the particle velocities recorded for each individual axis for the
duration of the event. The seismograph(s) shall also produce a numeric record of the
peak particle velocities and principle frequencies of the vibration recorded for each axis
during the event.

E. For each blast, the seismograph(s) shall be located in accordance with instructions
from the Engineer. As a minimum, one seismograph shall be located at the nearest
critical structure.

F. The peak particle velocities recorded on each of the three axes shall not exceed the
frequency-dependent limits contained in Bureau of Mines RI 8507 Alternative Blasting
Level Criteria (Figure ) at any of the monitoring locations.

G. Air overpressures from each blast shall be recorded at the monitoring locations using
the airblast channel of the blasting seismographs or with other suitable means. Readings
shall be in decibels or in pounds per square inch (psi) and shall be recorded as a linear,
unweighted value.

H. Air overpressures from blasting shall not exceed 133 dB (0.013 psi) at any of the
monitoring locations.

I. Flyrock will not be tolerated and shall be controlled through proper blast design. If
flyrock occurs, the cause shall be investigated by the blaster. Blasting shall not continue
until satisfactory corrective measures have been taken to preclude further flyrock
incidents.
