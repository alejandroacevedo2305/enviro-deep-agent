# N

#### N-type i-TOPCon bifacial dual glass

Monocrystalline module

## 710W 0~+5W

MAXIMUM POWER OUTPUT POSITIVE POWER TOLERANCE

High customer value

Mono Multi Solutions

PRODUCT: TSM-NEG21C.20

PRODUCT RANGE: 685-710W

## 22.9%

MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY

- The star of LCOE (Levelized Cost Of Energy) .Higher string power

feature effectively reduces BOS (Balance of System)and LCOE

- More energy harvest with cutting-edge N-type i-TOPCon technology

- Designed for compatibility with existing mainstream system components

High power up to 710W

- Up to 22.9% module efficiency with high density interconnect

technology

- SMBB (Super multi-busbar) technology for better light trapping effect,

lower series resistance and improved current collection

High reliability

- Minimized micro-cracks with innovative non-destructive cutting

technology

- Ensured PID resistance through cell process and module material

control

- Resistant to harsh environments such as salt, ammonia, sand, high

temperature and high humidity areas

- Mechanical performance up to 5400 Pa positive load and 2400 Pa

negative load

High energy yield

- Excellent product bifaciality and low irradiation performance,

validated by 3rd party

- Lower degradation:1% first year,0.4% annually thereafter

- Lower temperature coefficient (-0.29%/°C)

- Up to 30% additional power gain from back side depending on albedo
