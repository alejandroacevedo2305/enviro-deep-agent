**The Cat** **[®]** **D6T has earned a reputation for best-in-class**
**versatility, productivity and resale value. Because it**
**excels across a wide range of dozing tasks, customers**
**choose the D6T for everything from dozing, ripping,**
**scraper work and land clearing to finish grading,**
**backfilling trenches, building oil/gas/wind farm pads**
**and working landfills. The D6T offers many of the robust**
**features found on larger tractors, with the reliability and**
**low operating costs customers have come to expect**
**from Cat Track-Type Tractors.**

### Structures

Rugged design for
maximum service

The foundation of every Cat dozer is a rugged frame built
to absorb high impact shock loads and twisting forces.
A reinforced saddle, welded front cross-member and steel
castings on the main case add to the overall strength.

The pivot shaft is bolted to the mainframe and connects
to the rear roller frames to allow independent oscillation.
The pivot shaft distributes impact loads through the case.
This design eliminates alignment problems and the need
for diagonal braces on the roller frames.

The pinned equalizer bar gives the roller frames the ability
to oscillate up and down to better match ground contours
for maximum traction and operator comfort. Bolted end
pins offer longer life and reduce downtime with improved
serviceability and reliability. A remote lubrication point in
the engine compartment provides easy access to lubricate
the center pin of the equalizer bar as part of scheduled
maintenance practices.

### Operator Station

Comfort and Convenience

The D6T cab is designed for operator productivity, safety and
comfort. An isolation-mounted, pressurized cab reduces noise
and vibration. Large single-pane windows offer excellent
visibility. The low rear window enables excellent rearward
visibility and lets the operator see the ripper tip. The tapered
hood, notched fuel tank, and narrow single-shank ripper
carriage give the operator a clear line of sight to front
and rear work areas.

The Cat Comfort Series seat is well padded and adjustable,
with bolsters to help support the operator when working on
slopes. Armrests are adjustable without tools, and heating/
air conditioning vents evenly distribute airflow. The cab
is pre-wired for a radio and equipped with two speakers,
an antenna and a radio mount recessed in the headliner.
A 10-amp, 12-volt power converter is also included to
provide convenient supplemental power for cellular
phones and computers.

### Engine

Power and Sustainability

Every component of a Cat engine is carefully designed to maximize durability and reliability.
Precise controls optimize power and fuel efficiency while reducing emissions.

The D6T features a Cat C9 engine with ACERTTM Technology. A series of Caterpillar engineered
innovations provide advanced electronic control, precision fuel delivery and refined air management,
resulting in outstanding performance and lower emissions.

Modular design and advanced electronic diagnostics enhance the engine’s serviceability. An optional
sand blast grid equips the machine for high airborne debris applications, and a demand fan saves fuel
in low ambient temperature conditions.

**Cooling System**
The D6T cooling system is durable and efficient, utilizing aluminum bar plate construction on the
radiator cores and Air To Air After Cooler (ATAAC). Aluminum bar plate provides durability and
allows for high heat transfer and superior corrosion resistance. The radiator consists of twin unit
cores that act together as one heat exchanger.

The Air To Air After Cooler is part of an advanced air management system that brings cool air
to the engine. This increases life, reduces emissions, and helps maximize fuel effi ciency.

The twin core is designed for easy service. Either half of the radiator can be removed by itself
to reduce downtime and repair costs. A sight gauge makes daily service checks convenient.

The rugged aluminum bar plate construction helps protect against coolant leaks caused by tube
punctures in abrasive applications. The unit core construction also reduces leak potential by
eliminating core seals.

### Power Train

Powerful efficiency

The powershift transmission and differential steering work in
tandem with the Cat C9 engine to deliver outstanding power,
productive performance and reliability.

**Two Pump Hydraulic System**
A dual hydraulic pump design provides dedicated hydraulic
power to steering and implements for a 20 percent steering
improvement. The slip pump design improves response in
simultaneous steering/implement applications for greater
maneuverability. The constant flow in steering circuit
improves hydraulic cooling, increasing cooling capacity.

**Multi Velocity Program (MVP)**

This exclusive machine control system allows the operator
to choose from five speed ranges in Forward and Reverse
to best match machine speed to applications and ground
conditions. MVP improves productivity in light applications
(partial blade loads), where more speed flexibility is desired.

**Differential Steering System**

Differential steering maintains full power to both
tracks, providing best in class turning with a loaded blade.
When one track speeds up, the other slows down an equal
amount. Maneuverability - especially with large blade loads
- is improved, as well as cycle times in some applications.
Greater load capacity, power and speed control are possible
in soft underfoot conditions on steep slopes because both
tracks are powered during turns. Low effort tiller bar,
touch shift control and steering modulation insure ease
of operation.

**Torque Divider**
A single-stage torque divider sends 70 percent of engine
torque through a converter and 30 percent through a direct
drive shaft. This provides greater drive line effi ciency and
higher torque multiplication, delivering more power to
the ground to optimize operator productivity.

### Implement and Steering Controls

Ergonomically designed for ease of operation

**Steering and Transmission Control**

Turns and directional changes are controlled with a single
tiller handle. Buttons change the electronically controlled
powershift transmission. Operators are able to work precisely
in tight areas and around obstacles.

**Dozer and Ripper Control Levers**
The D6T features ergonomically designed dozer and
ripper controls with low-effort, pilot-operated hydraulics.
When equipped with a VPAT blade, the blade control allows
simultaneous six-way control of the blade with a thumb rocker.
The dozer control is equipped as an electro-hydraulic control
when the AccuGradeTM Ready Option is installed.

**Throttle Rocker Switch**

The fingertip rocker switch activates high or low idle.
A decelerator pedal gives the operator full control of engine
speed when the rocker switch is in the high idle position.
Engine speed can be set between high and low idle by
simultaneously using the decelerator pedal and holding
the Rabbit side of the throttle switch for three seconds.

**Work Tool Lock-Out Switch**

Work tool lock-out prevents inadvertent operation of hydraulic
work tool attachments.

**Auto-Shift/Auto-Kickdown**

Operators can pre-select a forward and reverse speed setting
for easy, efficient directional changes. Auto-kickdown allows
the transmission to automatically downshift when signifi cant
load increases are detected.

**Instrument Panel and Cat Monitoring System**

The instrument panel, with easy-to-read gauges and warning
lamps, keeps the operator aware of all system information.
All gauges and readouts are easily visible in direct sunlight.
The Cat Monitoring System has a dash mounted instrument
cluster showing on-the-go operating information and insight
into operation and maintenance needs.

### Integrated Technologies

Solutions to make work easier and more efficient

**AccuGrade System for Track-Type Tractors**
The AccuGrade System automates blade control for greater grading accuracy and more cost effective operation.
Machine-mounted sensors calculate precise blade slope and elevation, which is used by sensors to automatically adjust
the blade to maintain grade. Automated blade control improves efficiency and productivity by reaching grade faster and
in fewer passes, reducing the need for traditional survey stakes or grade checkers.

**AccuGrade Ready Option**
AccuGrade systems and controls can be integrated from the factory, making system installation and setup quick and easy.
Integration also provides greater wear protection and reliability.

**AccuGrade Laser**

Laser signals from a transmitter on the work site are picked up by a machine mounted receiver to provide a constant grade
reference. The system calculates blade adjustments to achieve grade, makes automatic elevation adjustments and provides
automatic blade control. The system also calculates cut/fill requirements for manual blade control.

**AccuGrade GPS**

Using global satellite-based positioning, AccuGrade GPS computes 3-dimensional positioning information on the machine,
compares the position of the blade relative to the design plan, and delivers that information to the operator via an in-cab display.

**Cat Product Link***

Remote monitoring with Product Link improves overall fleet-management effectiveness. Product Link is deeply integrated into
machine systems. Events and diagnostic codes, as well as hours, fuel, idle time and other detailed information are transmitted
to a secure web based application, VisionLinkTM. VisionLink includes powerful tools to convey information to users and
dealers, including mapping, working and idle time, fuel level and more.

_* Product Link licensing not available in all areas. Please consult your Cat dealer for availability._

**7**

### Work Tools

Equipped for the job

**8**

**L-Shaped Push Arms**
L-shaped push arms bring the blade closer to the machine
than diagonal brace designs, providing excellent maneuverability,
balance, and blade penetration. This design provides solid
lateral stability and better cylinder positions for constant
pryout independent of blade height.

**Load Sensing Hydraulics**

Field-proven, load-sensing hydraulics respond to operating
requirements by automatically and continually adjusting
hydraulic power to maximize work tool effi ciency.

**Cat Blades**

Cat blades feature a strong box-section design, made from
Cat DH-2TM steel with high tensile strength to stand up to
the most severe applications. Heavy moldboard construction
and hardened bolt-on cutting edges and end bits add
strength and durability.

**Semi-Universal Blade**

The Semi-Universal blade is built for tough applications
where penetration and capacity are important. The blade
wings are designed for superior load retention and
penetration in tightly packed materials.

**Straight Blade**

The S-blade provides good versatility. Because it has
less blade capacity, it can handle heavier materials than
a larger blade.

**Angle Blade**

The angle blade is secured by outside-mounted push arms
using a pinned connection that allows blade angling and
tilting, left or right. Blade angle is changed manually and
blade tilt is changed hydraulically.

**Variable Pitch Angle Tilt (VPAT) Blade**

The VPAT blade allows the operator to hydraulically adjust
the blade lift, angle, and tilt simultaneously. The operator
can also manually adjust blade pitch when the needs arise.
This versatility gives the D6T the ability to take on a variety
of applications such as finish grading, spreading material,
slot-dozing, side casting, V-ditching, and trench backfi lling.

### Undercarriage

Engineered for performance

The D6T features the Caterpillar elevated sprocket design
that isolates final drives, axles, and steering components
from harsh impacts. The modular design aids serviceability
to help reduce maintenance costs. A variety of undercarriage
configurations and track shoe designs help optimize
performance and undercarriage life.

**SystemOneTM Undercarriage**

SystemOne can help reduce total undercarriage owning and
operating costs in many applications. Lifetime sealed and
lubricated cartridges eliminate bushing turns and sprockets
require no replacement during the life of the chain.
All SystemOne undercarriage components are designed
to work and wear as a system for longer track life.

**Heavy Duty Undercarriage (optional)**
Heavy duty undercarriage is well-suited to aggressive
applications like land clearing, side-slopes, or working
in rocky or uneven terrain. Components are designed
for extended wear life in abrasive conditions and high
impact applications.

### Rear Implements

Versatility and balance

**Multi-Shank Ripper**
The multi-shank parallelogram style ripper is offered
with one, two, or three shanks to best suit job conditions.
Curved or straight ripper shanks are available.

**Winch**

A single lever control actuates both clutch and brake functions
to help improve operator efficiency. See your Cat dealer for
available winch options.

**Rear Counterweight**

Optimize balance for backing up steep slopes or increasing
performance in heavy dozing applications. Rear counterweights
are recommended if another rear attachment is not specifi ed,
and are required with VPAT blades.

**Drawbar**

The D6T can be equipped with a drawbar for retrieving other
equipment or pulling work tools such as disks, compactors, or
chopper wheels. Optional implement towing arrangements allow
for quick setup of a hydraulically controlled towed scraper.

### Serviceability

When uptime counts

**10**

Cat Track-Type Tractors are designed with ease of
serviceability in mind. Modular components, grouped service
points and quick diagnostics help keep machines actively at
work on the job site.

**Power Train Oil Filter and Pressure Taps**
The power train oil filter and pressure taps are remote-mounted
in the right-hand fender. Quick disconnect fittings allow for
fast diagnosis of the power train and hydraulic oil systems.

**Engine Oil Filter**
The engine oil filter is easily accessed on the right side of the
engine compartment. An optional quick oil change attachment
can further reduce maintenance time.

**Water Separator and Fuel Filter**
Easily located just inside the engine access panel, the water
separator functions as the primary fuel filter, just ahead of
the secondary fuel filter. A standard electric priming pump
on the primary filter reduces the effort required to prime
the system.

**Scheduled Oil Sampling Analysis (S·O·S** **[SM]** **)**
Preventive maintenance through Scheduled Oil Sampling is
made easier through live sampling ports for the engine oil,
power train hydraulics and coolant. The ports are color
coded for easy identification of each system.
