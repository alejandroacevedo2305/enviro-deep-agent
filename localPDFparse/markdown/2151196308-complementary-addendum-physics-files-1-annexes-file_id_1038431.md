# INTRODUCTION I N THIS document, guidelines are established for the protec
tion of humans exposed to electric and magnetic fields in
the low-frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum.
The general principles for the development of ICNIRP
guidelines are published elsewhere (ICNIRP 2002). For the
purpose of this document, the low-frequency range extends
from 1 Hz to 100 kHz. Above 100 kHz, effects such as
heating need to be considered, which are covered by other
ICNIRP guidelines. However, in the frequency range from
100 kHz up to approximately 10 MHz protection from both,
low frequency effects on the nervous system as well as high
frequency effects need to be considered depending on
exposure conditions. Therefore, some guidance in this
document is extended to 10 MHz to cover the nervous

system effects in this frequency range. Guidelines for
static magnetic fields have been issued in a separate
document (ICNIRP 2009). Guidelines applicable to
movement-induced electric fields or time-varying magnetic fields up to 1 Hz will be published separately.
This publication replaces the low-frequency part of
the 1998 guidelines (ICNIRP 1998). ICNIRP is currently
revising the guidelines for the high-frequency portion of
the spectrum (above 100 kHz).

# SCOPE AND PURPOSE

The main objective of this publication is to establish
guidelines for limiting exposure to electric and magnetic
fields (EMF) that will provide protection against all
established adverse health effects.

Studies on both direct and indirect effects of EMF have

been assessed: direct effects result from direct interactions

of fields with the body; indirect effects involve interactions

with a conducting object where the electric potential of the
object is different from that of the body. Results of laboratory and epidemiological studies, basic exposure assessment
criteria, and reference levels for practical hazard assessment
are discussed, and the guidelines presented here are applicable to both occupational and public exposure.
The restrictions in these guidelines were based on
established evidence regarding acute effects; currently
available knowledge indicates that adherence to these restrictions protect workers and members of the public from
adverse health effects from exposure to low frequency
EMF. The epidemiological and biological data concerning
chronic conditions were carefully reviewed and it was
concluded that there is no compelling evidence that they are
causally related to low-frequency EMF exposure.
These guidelines do not address product performance standards, which are intended to limit EMF
emissions from specific devices under specified test
conditions, nor does the document deal with the techniques used to measure any of the physical quantities that
characterize electric, magnetic and electromagnetic
fields. Comprehensive descriptions of instrumentation
and measurement techniques for accurately determining
such physical quantities may be found elsewhere (IEC
2004, 2005a; IEEE 1994, 2008).
Compliance with the present guidelines may not necessarily preclude interference with, or effects on, medical
devices such as metallic prostheses, cardiac pacemakers and
implanted defibrillators and cochlear implants. Interference
with pacemakers may occur at levels below the recommended reference levels. Advice on avoiding these problems is beyond the scope of the present document but is
available elsewhere (IEC 2005b).
These guidelines will be periodically revised and
updated as advances are made in the scientific knowledge
concerning any aspect relevant for limiting exposure of low
frequency time-varying electric and magnetic fields.

# QUANTITIES AND UNITS

Whereas electric fields are associated only with the
presence of electric charge, magnetic fields are the result

818

Limiting exposure to time-varying electric and magnetic fields - ICNIRP 819

of the physical movement of electric charge (electric
current). An electric field, _E_, exerts a force on an electric
charge and is expressed in volts per meter (V m [] [1] ).
Similarly, magnetic fields can exert physical forces on
electric charges, if such charges are in motion and/or the
magnetic field varies with time. Electric and magnetic
fields have both magnitude and direction (i.e., they are
vectors). A magnetic field can be specified in two
ways--as magnetic flux density, _B_, expressed in tesla
(T), or as magnetic field strength, _H_, expressed in ampere
per meter (A m [] [1] ). The two quantities are related by the
expression:

_**B**_   _**H**_ (1)

where  is the constant of proportionality (the magnetic
permeability); in vacuum and air, as well as in nonmagnetic (including biological) materials,  has the
value 4   10 [] [7] when expressed in Henry per meter (H
m [] [1] ). Thus, in describing a magnetic field for protection
purposes, only one of the quantities _B_ or _H_ needs to be
specified.
Exposure to time-varying EMF results in internal
electric fields and in body currents and energy absorption
in tissues that depend on the coupling mechanisms and
the frequency involved. The internal electric field _E_ i and
current density _J_ are related by Ohm’s Law:

_**J**_   _**E**_ i (2)

where  is the electrical conductivity of the medium. The
dosimetric quantities used in these guidelines are as
follows:

- electric field _E_ i ; and

- Current _I_ .

A general summary of EMF and dosimetric quantities and
units used in these guidelines is provided in Table 1.

# SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR LIMITING EXPOSURE

scientific literature. Well established criteria were used to

evaluate the scientific validity of the methodology, results and conclusions of reported findings. Only effects
for which there was reliable scientific evidence were

used as the basis for the exposure restrictions.
Biological effects of exposure to low frequency
electromagnetic fields have been reviewed by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),
ICNIRP, and the World Health Organization (WHO)
(IARC 2002; ICNIRP 2003a; WHO 2007a) and national expert groups. Those publications provided the
scientific basis for these guidelines.
As detailed below, the basis for the guidelines is
two-fold: Exposure to low-frequency electric fields may
cause well-defined biological responses, ranging from
perception to annoyance, through surface electric-charge
effects. In addition, the only well established effects in
volunteers exposed to low frequency magnetic fields are
the stimulation of central and peripheral nervous tissues
and the induction in the retina of phosphenes, a perception of faint flickering light in the periphery of the visual
field. The retina is part of the CNS and is regarded as an
appropriate, albeit conservative, model for induced electric field effects on CNS neuronal circuitry in general.
In view of the uncertainty inherent in the scientific
data, reduction factors have been applied in establishing
the exposure guidelines. For details see ICNIRP 2002.

**Coupling mechanisms between fields and the body**
Human and animal bodies significantly perturb the
spatial distribution of a low frequency electric field. At
low frequencies, the body is a good conductor, and the
perturbed field lines external to the body are nearly
perpendicular to the body surface. Oscillating charges are
induced on the surface of the exposed body and these
produce currents inside the body. Key features of dosimetry for exposure of humans to low frequency electric
fields include:

- the electric field induced inside the body is considerably smaller than the external electric field, e.g., five to
six orders of magnitude at 50-60 Hz;

- for a given external electric field, the strongest fields
are induced when the human body is in perfect contact
with the ground through the feet (electrically
grounded), and the weakest induced fields are for the
body insulated from the ground (in “free space”);

- the total current flowing in a body in perfect contact
with ground is determined by the body size and shape
(including posture) rather than tissue conductivity;

- the distribution of induced currents across the various

organs and tissues is determined by the conductivity of
those tissues; and

820 Health Physics December 2010, Volume 99, Number 6

- there is also an indirect effect, where the current in the
body is produced by contact with a conductive object
located in an electric field.

For magnetic fields, the permeability of tissue is the
same as that of air, so the field in tissue is the same as the
external field. Human and animal bodies do not significantly perturb the field. The main interaction of magnetic
fields is the Faraday induction of electric fields and
associated currents in the tissues. Electric fields may also
be induced by movement in a static magnetic field. Key
features of dosimetry for exposure of humans to low
frequency magnetic fields include:

- for a given magnetic field strength and orientation,
higher electric fields are induced in the bodies of larger
people because the possible conduction loops are
larger;

- the induced electric field and current depend on the
orientation of the external magnetic field to the body.
Generally induced fields in the body are greatest when
the field is aligned from the front to the back of the
body, but for some organs the highest values are for
different field alignments;

- the weakest electric fields are induced by a magnetic
field oriented along the principal body axis; and

- the distribution of the induced electric field is affected

by the conductivity of the various organs and tissues.

**Conclusions from the current scientific literature**

**Neurobehavior.** Exposure to low-frequency electric
fields causes well-defined biological responses, ranging
from perception to annoyance, through surface electriccharge effects (Reilly 1998, 1999). Thresholds for direct
perception by the most sensitive 10% of volunteers at
50-60 Hz ranged between 2 and 5 kV m [] [1] and 5% found
15-20 kV m [] [1] annoying. The spark discharge from a
person to ground is found to be painful to 7% of
volunteers in a field of 5 kV m [] [1], whereas it would be
painful to about 50% in a 10 kV m [] [1] field. Thresholds for
the spark discharge from a charged object through a
grounded person depend on the size of the object and
therefore require individual assessment.
The responsiveness of electrically excitable nerve
and muscle tissue to electric stimuli including those
induced by exposure to low-frequency EMFs has been
well established for many years (e.g., Reilly 2002;
Saunders and Jefferys 2007). Myelinated nerve fibers of
the human peripheral nervous system have been estimated to have a minimum threshold value of around 6
V peak m [] [1] (Reilly 1998, 2002), based on theoretical
calculation using a nerve model. However, peripheral
nerve stimulation induced during volunteer exposure to

the switched gradient magnetic fields of magnetic resonance (MR) systems suggested that the threshold for
perception may be as low as about 2 V m [] [1] (Nyenhuis et
al. 2001), based on calculations using a homogeneous
human phantom model. A more accurate calculation of
the electric fields induced in the tissues of a heterogeneous human model based on data from the above MR

study has been carried out by So et al. (2004). These
authors estimated the minimum threshold for peripheral
nerve stimulation of between about 4-6 V m [] [1], based on
the assumption that stimulation took place in the skin or
subcutaneous fat. With stronger stimuli, discomfort and
then pain ensue; the lowest percentile for intolerable
stimulation is approximately 20% above the median
threshold for perception (ICNIRP 2004). Myelinated
nerve fibers of the central nervous system (CNS) can be
stimulated by electric fields induced during transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS); the pulsed fields induced in
cortical tissue during TMS are quite high (  100 V
m [] [1]
peak [), although theoretical calculation suggests that]
minimum stimulation threshold values may be as low as
 10 V m [] [1] peak [(Reilly 1998, 2002). For both sets of]
nerves, thresholds rise above around 1-3 kHz due to the
progressively shorter time available for the accumulation
of electric charge on the nerve membrane and below
about 10 Hz due to the accommodation of a nerve to a
slowly depolarizing stimulus. [†]

Muscle cells are in general less sensitive to direct
stimulation than nerve tissue (Reilly 1998). Cardiac
muscle tissue deserves particular attention because aberrant function is potentially life-threatening: however,
ventricular fibrillation thresholds exceed those for car
diac muscle stimulation by a factor of 50 or more (Reilly
2002), although this drops considerably if the heart is
repeatedly excited during the vulnerable period of the
cardiac cycle. Thresholds rise above about 120 Hz due to
the much longer time-constant of muscle fibers compared with myelinated nerves.
The most robustly established effect of electric
fields below the threshold for direct nerve or muscle

excitation is the induction of magnetic phosphenes, the
perception of faint flickering light in the periphery of the
visual field, in the retinas of volunteers exposed to low
frequency magnetic fields. The minimum threshold flux
density is around 5 mT at 20 Hz, rising at higher and
lower frequencies. In these studies, the phosphenes are
thought to result from the interaction of the induced
electric field with electrically excitable cells in the retina.
This is formed as an outgrowth of the forebrain and can

 - Accommodation does not occur for example in response to the
low-frequency component of trapezoid or rectangular pulses with
quick rise-times but low repetition frequencies such as those found in
the switched gradient fields of MR systems.

be considered a good but conservative model of processes that occur in CNS tissue in general (Attwell 2003).
The threshold for induced electric field strengths in the
retina has been estimated to lie between about 50 and 100
mV m [] [1] at 20 Hz, rising at higher and lower frequencies
(Saunders and Jefferys 2007) although there is considerable uncertainty attached to these values.
The integrative properties of the nervous tissue of
the CNS may render it, and therefore functions such as
cognitive processes like memory, sensitive to the effects
of these physiologically weak electric fields. Saunders
and Jefferys (2002) suggested that the electrical polarization of neurons in the CNS by such weak electric
fields might enhance the synchronization of active
groups of neurons and affect the recruitment of adjacent
non-active neurons, thereby influencing overall nerve
cell excitability and activity. I _n vitro_ evidence from
studies using brain slices suggests that minimum thresholds for these effects lie below frequencies of  100 Hz
and may be as low as 100 mV m [] [1] (Saunders and
Jefferys 2007).
Two research groups have investigated the effects of
weak electric fields applied directly to the head via
electrodes [‡] on brain electrical activity and function in
humans. One group (Kanai et al. 2008) reported that
stimulation of the visual cortex induced the perception of
cortical phosphenes (similar in appearance to phosphenes
induced in the retina) when the stimulus frequency was
characteristic for visual cortical activity either in dark
conditions (around 10 Hz) or in light conditions (around
20 Hz) but not at higher or lower frequencies. The other
group (Pogosyan et al. 2009) applied a 20 Hz signal to
the motor cortex of volunteers during the performance of
a visuo-motor task and found a small but statistically
significant slowing of hand movement during task performance, which was consistent with an increased synchronization of 20 Hz motor cortex activity. No effect
was seen at a lower stimulus frequency. In summary,
both groups of authors found that 10-20 Hz electric
fields, above the threshold for retinal phosphenes, can
interact with ongoing rhythmic electrical activity in the
visual and motor cortices and slightly affect visual
processing and motor co-ordination, carrying the implication that 10-20 Hz EMF-induced electric fields of

sufficient magnitude may have similar effects.
However, the evidence for other neurobehavioral
effects on brain electrical activity, cognition, sleep, and
mood in volunteers exposed to low frequency EMFs is
much less clear (Cook et al. 2002, 2006; Crasson 2003;
ICNIRP 2003a; Barth et al. 2010). Generally, such

 - Transcranial AC stimulation or tACS is applied at levels below
local skin perception thresholds.

studies have been carried out at exposure levels at or
below about 1-2 mT; i.e., below those required to induce
the effects described above, and have produced evidence
of subtle and transitory effects at most. The conditions
necessary to elicit such responses are not well defined at
present.
Some people claim to be hypersensitive to EMFs in
general. However, the evidence from double-blind provocation studies suggests that the reported symptoms are
unrelated to EMF exposure (Rubin et al. 2005; WHO
2007a).
There is only inconsistent and inconclusive evidence
that exposure to low-frequency electric and magnetic
fields causes depressive symptoms or suicide (WHO
2007a).
In animals, the possibility that exposure to low
frequency fields may affect neurobehavioral functions
has been explored from a number of perspectives using a
range of exposure conditions. Few effects have been
established. There is convincing evidence that lowfrequency electric fields can be detected by animals,
most likely as a result of surface charge effects, and may
elicit transient arousal or mild stress. Other possible
field-dependent changes are less well defined (WHO
2007a).
Thus, the perception of surface electric charge, the
direct stimulation of nerve and muscle tissue and the

induction of retinal phosphenes are well established and
can serve as a basis for guidance. In addition, there is also
indirect scientific evidence that brain functions such as

visual processing and motor co-ordination can be transiently affected by induced electric fields. However, the
evidence from other neurobehavioral research in volun
teers exposed to low frequency electric and magnetic
fields is not sufficiently reliable to provide a basis for
human exposure limits.

**Neuroendocrine system.** The results of volunteer
studies as well as residential and occupational epidemiological studies suggest that the neuroendocrine system
is not adversely affected by exposure to 50-60 Hz
electric or magnetic fields. This applies particularly to
circulating levels of specific hormones, including melatonin released by the pineal gland, and to a number of
hormones involved in the control of body metabolism
and physiology released by the pituitary gland. Most
laboratory studies of the effects of 50-60 Hz exposure
on night-time melatonin levels in volunteers found no
effect when care was taken to control possible confounding (WHO 2007a).
From the large number of animal studies investigating the effects of 50-60 Hz electric and magnetic fields
on rat pineal and serum melatonin levels, some reported

822 Health Physics December 2010, Volume 99, Number 6

that exposure resulted in night-time suppression of melatonin, while other studies did not. In seasonally breeding animals, the evidence for an effect of exposure to
50-60 Hz fields on melatonin levels and melatonin
dependent reproductive status is predominantly negative
(ICNIRP 2003a; WHO 2007a). No convincing effect on
melatonin levels has been seen in a study of non-human
primates chronically exposed to 50-60 Hz fields.
No consistent effects have been seen in the stress
related hormones of the pituitary-adrenal axis in a variety
of mammalian species, with the possible exception of
short-lived stress following the onset of low frequency
electric-field exposure at levels high enough to be perceived (ICNIRP 2003a; WHO 2007a). Similarly, while
few studies have been carried out, mostly negative or
inconsistent effects have been seen in the levels of

growth hormone and hormones involved in controlling
metabolic activity or associated with the control of
reproduction and sexual development.
Overall, these data do not indicate that low frequency electric and/or magnetic fields affect the neuroendocrine system in a way that would have an adverse
impact on human health.

**Neurodegenerative disorders.** It has been hypothesized that exposure to low frequency fields is associated
with several neurodegenerative diseases. For Parkinson’s
disease and multiple sclerosis the number of studies has
been small and there is no evidence for an association

between low frequency exposure and these diseases. For
Alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) more studies have been published. Some of these
reports suggest that people employed in electrical occupations might have an increased risk for ALS (Kheifets et
al. 2009). So far, no biological mechanism has been
established which can explain this association, although it
could have arisen because of confounders related to electri
cal occupations, such as electric shocks. Furthermore, studies using more sophisticated exposure assessment methods,
e.g., job-exposure matrices, have generally not observed
increased risks (Kheifets et al. 2009). For Alzheimer’s
disease, results are inconsistent. Strongest associations
have been found in clinic based studies with a large
potential for selection bias, but increased risks have also
been observed in some, but not all, population based
studies. Subgroup analyses within studies strengthen the
impression of inconsistent data (Kheifets et al. 2009).
Statistical heterogeneity between study results speaks
against pooling of available results, although such attempts have been made (Garcia et al. 2008). In addition,
there is some evidence for publication bias. Control of
potential confounding from other occupational exposures
has generally not been made. So far only one residential

study is available, indicating an increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease after long-term exposure, but based on
very small numbers of cases (Huss et al. 2009).
The studies investigating the association between
low frequency exposure and Alzheimer’s disease are
inconsistent. Overall, the evidence for the association
between low frequency exposure and Alzheimer  s disease and ALS is inconclusive.

**Cardiovascular disorders.** Experimental studies of
both short-term and long-term exposure indicate that,
while electric shock is an obvious health hazard, other

hazardous cardiovascular effects associated with low

frequency fields are unlikely to occur at exposure levels
commonly encountered environmentally or occupationally (WHO 2007a). Though various cardiovascular
changes have been reported in the literature, the majority
of effects are small, and the results have not been
consistent within or between studies (McNamee et al.
2009). Most of the studies of cardiovascular disease
morbidity and mortality have shown no association with
exposure (Kheifets et al. 2007). Whether a specific
association exists between exposure and altered autonomic control of the heart remains speculative. Overall,
the evidence does not suggest an association between
low frequency exposure and cardiovascular diseases.

**Reproduction and development.** Overall, epidemiological studies have not shown an association between
human adverse reproductive outcomes and maternal or
paternal exposure to low frequency fields. There is some
limited evidence for increased risk of miscarriage associated with maternal magnetic field exposure, but this
reported association has not been found in other studies
and overall the evidence for such an association is poor.
Exposures to low frequency electric fields of up to
150 kV m [] [1] have been evaluated in several mammalian

species, including studies with large group sizes and
exposure over several generations; the results consistently show no adverse developmental effects (ICNIRP
2003a; WHO 2007a).
Low frequency magnetic field exposure of mammals does not result in gross external, visceral or skeletal
malformations using fields up to 20 mT (Juutilainen
2003, 2005; WHO 2007a). Overall, the evidence for an
association between low frequency and developmental
and reproductive effects is very weak.

**Cancer.** A considerable number of epidemiological
reports, carried out particularly during the 1980’s and
90’s, indicated that long term exposure to 50-60 Hz
magnetic fields, orders of magnitude below the limits of

Limiting exposure to time-varying electric and magnetic fields - ICNIRP 823

the 1998 ICNIRP exposure guidelines might be associated with cancer. While the first studies looked at

childhood cancer in relation to magnetic fields, later
research also investigated adult cancers. In general, the
initially observed associations between 50-60 Hz magnetic fields and various cancers were not confirmed in

studies designed to see whether the initial findings could
be replicated. However, for childhood leukemia the
situation is different. The research that followed the first

study has suggested that there may be a weak association
between the higher levels of exposure to residential
50-60 Hz magnetic fields and childhood leukemia risk,
although it is unclear whether it is causal: a combination
of selection bias, some degree of confounding and
chance could explain the results (WHO 2007a). Two
pooled analyses (Ahlbom et al. 2000; Greenland et al.
2000) indicate that an excess risk may exist for average
exposures exceeding 0.3-0.4  T, although the authors of
those analyses cautioned strongly that their results cannot
be interpreted as showing a causal relationship between
magnetic fields and childhood leukemia.
At the same time, no biophysical mechanism has
been identified and the experimental results from the
animal and cellular laboratory studies do not support the
notion that exposure to 50-60 Hz magnetic fields is a
cause of childhood leukemia.

It should be noted that there is currently no adequate
animal model of the most common form of childhood

leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Most studies
report no effect of 50-60 Hz magnetic fields on leukemia or lymphoma in rodent models (ICNIRP 2003a;
WHO 2007a). Several large-scale long-term studies in
rodents have not shown any consistent increase in any
type of cancer, including hematopoietic, mammary,
brain, and skin tumors.

A substantial number of studies have examined the

effects of 50-60 Hz magnetic fields on chemicallyinduced mammary tumors in rats (ICNIRP 2003a; WHO
2007a). Inconsistent results were obtained that may be
due in whole or in part to differences in experimental
protocols, such as the use of specific sub-strains. Most
studies on the effects of 50-60 Hz magnetic field
exposure on chemically-induced or radiation-induced
leukemia/lymphoma models were negative. Studies of
pre-neoplastic liver lesions, chemically-induced skin tumors, and brain tumors reported predominantly negative
results.

Generally, studies of the effects of low frequency
field exposure of cells have shown no induction of
genotoxicity at fields below 50 mT (Crumpton and
Collins 2004; WHO 2007a). Overall, in contrast to the
epidemiological evidence of an association between
childhood leukemia and prolonged exposure to power

frequency magnetic fields, the animal cancer data, particularly those from large-scale lifetime studies, are
almost universally negative. The data from cellular
studies are generally supportive of the animal studies,
though more equivocal.

**Rationale for these recommended low**
**frequency guidelines**
ICNIRP addresses acute and chronic health effects

and considers recent dosimetric developments in this
guidance.

**Acute effects.** There are a number of well estab
lished acute effects of exposure to low-frequency EMFs
on the nervous system: the direct stimulation of nerve
and muscle tissue and the induction of retinal phosphenes. There is also indirect scientific evidence that
brain functions such as visual processing and motor
co-ordination can be transiently affected by induced
electric fields. All these effects have thresholds below

which they do not occur and can be avoided by meeting
appropriate basic restrictions on electric fields induced in
the body.
Following the recommendations made concerning
guidelines on limits of exposure to static magnetic fields
(ICNIRP 2009), ICNIRP considers that there are occupational circumstances where, with appropriate advice
and training, it is reasonable for workers voluntarily and
knowingly to experience transient effects such as retinal
phosphenes and possible minor changes in some brain
functions, since they are not believed to result in longterm or pathological health effects. Exposure of all parts
of the body in these circumstances should be limited in
order to avoid peripheral and central myelinated nerve
stimulation. ICNIRP notes the relatively narrow margin
between peripheral nerve perception and pain thresholds;
see above. For both types of nerves, thresholds rise above
around 1-3 kHz due to the very short membrane timeconstants resulting from myelination, and below about 10
Hz due to the accommodation to a slowly depolarizing
stimulus.

Avoiding retinal phosphenes should protect against
any possible effects on brain function. Phosphene thresholds are a minimum around 20 Hz and rise rapidly at
higher and lower frequencies, intersecting with the
thresholds for peripheral and central nerve stimulation at
which point limits on peripheral nerve stimulation should
apply. For workers who are not trained and who may be
unaware and not in control of their exposure status the
basic restriction is set at the phosphene threshold in order
to avoid these transient but potentially disturbing effects
of exposure. For members of the public, a reduction
factor of 5 is applied to the phosphene threshold.

824 Health Physics December 2010, Volume 99, Number 6

Exposure to low-frequency electric fields causes
well-defined biological responses through surface
electric-charge effects. Prevention of the painful effects
of surface electric charge induced on the body by such
exposure are addressed by the reference levels.

**Chronic effects.** The literature on chronic effects of

low frequency fields has been evaluated in detail by
individual scientists and scientific panels. WHO’s cancer
research institute, IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), evaluated low frequency magnetic
fields in 2002 and classified them in category 2 B, which
translates to “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” The
basis for this classification was the epidemiologic results
on childhood leukemia.

It is the view of ICNIRP that the currently existing
scientific evidence that prolonged exposure to low frequency magnetic fields is causally related with an increased risk of childhood leukemia is too weak to form

the basis for exposure guidelines. In particular, if the
relationship is not causal, then no benefit to health will
accrue from reducing exposure.

**Dosimetry.** Historically, magnetic field models assumed that the body has a homogeneous and isotropic
conductivity and applied simple circular conductive loop
models to estimate induced currents in different organs
and body regions. Electric fields induced by time varying
electric and magnetic fields were computed by using
simple homogeneous ellipsoid models. In recent years,
more realistic calculations based on anatomically and
electrically refined heterogeneous models (Xi and
Stuchly 1994; Dimbylow 2005, 2006; Bahr et al. 2007)
resulted in a much better knowledge of internal electric
fields in the body from exposure to electric and magnetic
fields.

The most useful dosimetric results for the purpose of
these guidelines have been obtained from high resolution
calculations of induced electric field with voxel sizes

below 4 mm (Dimbylow 2005; Bahr et al. 2007; Hirata et
al. 2009; Nagaoka et al. 2004). The maximum electric
field is induced in the body when the external fields are
homogeneous and directed parallel to the body axis
(E-field) or perpendicular (H-field). According to those
calculations, the maximum local peak electric field
induced by a 50 Hz magnetic field in the brain is
approximately 23-33 mV m [] [1] per mT, depending on
field orientation and body model. There is no conversion
factor for peripheral nerve tissue available at present.
Therefore, the skin, which contains peripheral nerve
endings, was chosen as a worst-case target tissue. The
electric field induced in the skin by such a field is
approximately 20-60 mV m [] [1] per mT. The maximum

local electric field induced by a 50 Hz electric field in the
brain is approximately 1.7-2.6 mV m [] [1] per kV m [] [1],
while in the skin it is approximately 12-33 mV m [] [1] per
kV m [] [1] .

In view of the uncertainties in the available dosim
etry as well as the influence of body parameters in the
derivation of reference levels, ICNIRP is taking a conservative approach in deriving reference levels from the
basic restrictions.

# GUIDELINES FOR LIMITING EMF EXPOSURE

Separate guidance is given for occupational exposures and exposure of the general public. Occupational
exposure in these guidelines refers to adults exposed to
time-varying electric, and magnetic fields from 1 Hz to
10 MHz at their workplaces, generally under known
conditions, and as a result of performing their regular or
assigned job activities. By contrast, the term general
population refers to individuals of all ages and of varying
health status which might increase the variability of the
individual susceptibilities. In many cases, members of
the public are unaware of their exposure to EMF. These
considerations underlie the adoption of more stringent
exposure restrictions for the public than for workers
while they are occupationally exposed.

**Addressing scientific uncertainty**
All scientific data and their interpretation are subject
to some degree of uncertainty. Examples are methodological variability and inter-individual, inter-species,
and inter-strain differences. Such uncertainties in knowl
edge are compensated for by reduction factors.
There is, however, insufficient information on all
sources of uncertainty to provide a rigorous basis for
establishing reduction factors over the whole frequency
range and for all modulation patterns. Therefore, the
degree to which caution is applied in the interpretation of
the available database and in defining reduction factors is
to a large extent a matter of expert judgment.

**Basic restrictions and reference levels**
Limitations of exposure that are based on the physical quantity or quantities directly related to the established health effects are termed basic restrictions. In this

guideline, the physical quantity used to specify the basic
restrictions on exposure to EMF is the internal electric
field strength _E_ i, as it is the electric field that affects
nerve cells and other electrically sensitive cells.
The internal electric field strength is difficult to
assess. Therefore, for practical exposure assessment purposes, reference levels of exposure are provided. Most

Limiting exposure to time-varying electric and magnetic fields - ICNIRP 825

reference levels are derived from relevant basic restric
tions using measurement and/or computational techniques but some address perception (electric field) and
adverse indirect effects of exposure to EMF. The derived
quantities are electric field strength ( _E_ ), magnetic field
# strength ( H ), magnetic flux density ( B ) and currents

flowing through the limbs ( _I_ L ). The quantity that addresses indirect effects is the contact current ( _I_ C ). In any
particular exposure situation, measured or calculated
values of any of these quantities can be compared with
the appropriate reference level. Compliance with the
reference level will ensure compliance with the relevant
basic restriction. If the measured or calculated value ex
ceeds the reference level, it does not necessarily follow that
the basic restriction will be exceeded. However, whenever a
reference level is exceeded it is necessary to test compliance
with the relevant basic restriction and to determine whether

additional protective measures are necessary.

# BASIC RESTRICTIONS

The main objective of this publication is to establish
guidelines for limiting EMF exposure that will provide
protection against adverse health effects. As noted above,
the risks come from transient nervous system responses
including peripheral (PNS) and central nerve stimulation
(CNS), the induction of retinal phosphenes and possible
effects on some aspects of brain function.
In view of the considerations above for frequencies
in the range 10 Hz to 25 Hz, occupational exposure
should be limited to fields that induce electric field

strengths in CNS tissue of the head (i.e., the brain and
retina) of less than 50 mV m [] [1] in order to avoid the
induction of retinal phosphenes. These restrictions
should also prevent any possible transient effects on
brain function. These effects are not considered to be

adverse health effects; however, ICNIRP recognizes that
they may be disturbing in some occupational circumstances
and should be avoided but no additional reduction factor is

applied. Phosphene thresholds rise rapidly at higher and
lower frequencies, intersecting with the thresholds for peripheral and central myelinated nerve stimulation at 400 Hz.
At frequencies above 400 Hz, limits on peripheral nerve
stimulation apply in all parts of the body.
Exposure in controlled environments, where workers are informed about the possible transient effects of
such exposure, should be limited to fields that induce
electric fields in the head and body of less than 800 mV
m [] [1] in order to avoid peripheral and central myelinated
nerve stimulation. A reduction factor of 5 has been
applied to a stimulation threshold of 4 V m [] [1] in order to
account for the uncertainties described above. Such

restrictions rise above 3 kHz.

For the general public for CNS tissue of the head a
reduction factor of 5 is applied, giving a basic restriction
of 10 mV m [] [1] between 10 and 25 Hz. Above and below

these values, the basic restrictions rise. At 1,000 Hz it
intersects with basic restrictions that protect against
peripheral and central myelinated nerve stimulation.
Here, the reduction factor of 10 results in a basic
restriction of 400 mV m [] [1], which should be applied to
the tissues of all parts of the body.
The basic restrictions are presented in Table 2 and
Fig. 1.

**Time averaging**
ICNIRP recommends that the restrictions on internal

electric fields induced by electric or magnetic fields including transient or very short-term peak fields be regarded as
instantaneous values which should not be time averaged
(see also section on non-sinusoidal exposure).

**Spatial averaging of induced electric field**
When restricting adverse effects of induced electric
fields to nerve cells and networks, it is important to
define the distance or volume over which the local

induced electric field must be averaged. As a practical
compromise, satisfying requirements for a sound biological basis and computational constraints, ICNIRP recommends determining the induced electric field as a vector
average of the electric field in a small contiguous tissue
volume of 2  2  2 mm [3] . For a specific tissue, the 99 [th]

percentile value of the electric field is the relevant value
to be compared with the basic restriction.

electric and magnetic fields.

Basically the electric field effects on neurons and
other electrically excitable cells are local effects, but
there are electrophysiological and practical dosimetric
factors that constrain the minimum volume or distance.

The major physical factor disturbing the function of
neurons and neuronal networks is the voltage produced
by the induced electric field over the membrane of the
cell. For isolated nerve fibers aligned along the direction
of the electric field (maximum coupling) this voltage is
integrated from the electric field over the electrotonic
distance varying from 2 to 7 millimeters for invertebrate
nerves (Reilly 1998; Reilly and Diamant 2003). For
myelinated nerve cells a good assumption for the integration distance is approximately 2 mm, which is the
maximum inter-nodal distance between the nodes of

Ranvier. These distances are relevant when considering
stimulation thresholds to isolated nerve cells. In the case

of sub-threshold weak electric field effects, such as
retinal phosphenes, the collective “network” effect of
numerous interacting nerve cells must be taken into
account. The threshold of the effect is considerably lower
than the stimulation threshold of isolated nerve cells,
which is due to summation and integration of small,
induced voltages in the synapses. It has been suggested
that the averaging volume for the induced electric field
should be based on minimum of 1,000 interacting cells,
which is approximately 1 mm [3] in most nerve tissue
(Jefferys 1994). Hence, a biologically reasonable averaging distance might extend from 1 to 7 mm. From a
practical point of view, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory accuracy in the millimeter resolution computation of
the induced electric field, and even more difficult to

measure it. Maximal values in one voxel in a specific
tissue are prone to large stair-casing errors associated
with sharp corners of the cubical voxel. A solution to
obtain more stable peak approximations is based on
choosing for the peak value a value representing the 99 [th]

percentile value of the induced field in a specific tissue.
From the biological point of view however, this is a
somewhat arbitrary choice because the peak value depends on the resolution. Another option for the spatial
averaging is to define the local electric field as an
average in a small volume or along a line segment (Reilly
and Diamant 2003).
As a general rule the averaging volume should not
extend beyond the boundary of the tissue except for
tissues such as the retina and skin, which are too thin to
cover the whole averaging cube. For the skin the same
averaging volume of 2  2  2 mm [3] can be assumed,
and it may extend to the subcutaneous tissue. For the
retina the averaging volume may extend to the tissues in
front and behind it.

**REFERENCE LEVELS**

The reference levels are obtained from the basic

restrictions by mathematical modeling using published
data (Dimbylow 2005, 2006). They are calculated for the
condition of maximum coupling of the field to the
exposed individual, thereby providing maximum protection. Frequency dependence and dosimetric uncertainties
were taken into account. The reference levels presented
consider two distinct effects and approximate a combination of the induced electric fields in the brain,

Limiting exposure to time-varying electric and magnetic fields - ICNIRP 827

relevant for CNS effects, and the induced electric
fields in non-CNS tissues anywhere in the body,
relevant for PNS effects (i.e., at 50 Hz, the factor used
to convert the basic restriction for CNS effects to an
external magnetic field exposure is 33 V m [] [1] per T,
and for PNS effect 60 V m [] [1] per T. An additional
reduction factor of 3 was applied to these calculated
values to allow for dosimetric uncertainty).
In addition, the electric field reference level for
occupational exposure up to 25 Hz includes a sufficient
margin to prevent stimulation effects from contact currents under most practical conditions. Between 25 Hz
and 10 MHz the reference levels are based on the basic

restriction on induced electric fields only and might thus
not provide a sufficient margin to prevent stimulation
effects from contact currents under all possible conditions in that frequency band.
The electric field reference levels for general public
exposure up to 10 MHz prevent adverse indirect effects
(shocks and burns) for more than 90% of exposed
individuals. In addition, the electric field reference levels
for general public exposure up to 50 Hz include a
sufficient margin to prevent surface electric-charge effects such as perception in most people.
Tables 3 and 4 summarize the reference levels for

occupational and general public exposure, respectively,
and the reference levels are illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3.
The reference levels assume an exposure by a uniform
(homogeneous) field with respect to the spatial extension
of the human body.

**Spatial averaging of external electric and**
**magnetic fields**
Reference levels have been determined for the

exposure conditions where the variation of the electric or
magnetic field over the space occupied by the body is
relatively small. In most cases, however, the distance to

the source of the field is so close that the distribution of

the field is non-uniform or localized to a small part of the
body. In these cases the measurement of the maximum
field strength in the position of space occupied by the
body always results in a safe, albeit very conservative
exposure assessment.
For a very localized source with a distance of a few
centimeters from the body, the only realistic option for
the exposure assessment is to determine dosimetrically
the induced electric field, case by case. When the
distance exceeds 20 cm, the distribution of the field
becomes less localized but is still non-uniform, in which
case it is possible to determine the spatial average along
the body or part of it (Stuchly and Dawson 2002; Jokela
2007). The spatial average should not exceed the reference level. The local exposure may exceed the reference
level but with an important provision that the basic
restriction shall not be exceeded. It is the task of

standardization bodies to give further guidance on the
specific exposure situations where the spatial averaging
can be applied. This guidance shall be based on well
established dosimetry. The standardization bodies also
may derive new reference levels for special types of
non-uniform exposure.

**Additivity of exposure to electric and**
**magnetic fields**
Each of the external electric and magnetic field
induces an electric field component, which add vectorially in the tissue. In the case of the exposure analysis
based on the external electric and magnetic fields, a
conservative approach would be to assume that both the
electrically and magnetically induced field components
attain the maximum value in the same critical point at the
same phase. This would imply that the exposures to the
external electric and magnetic fields are additive (Cech et
al. 2008). Such situations, however, are judged to be very

electric fields.

# REFERENCE LEVELS FOR

**CONTACT CURRENTS**

Up to 10 MHz reference levels for contact current
are given for which caution must be exercised to avoid
shock and burn hazards. The point contact reference
levels are presented in Table 5. Since the threshold
contact currents that elicit biological responses in children are approximately one-half of those for adult men,
the reference levels for contact current for the general
public are set lower by a factor of 2 than the values for
occupational exposure. It should be noted that the reference levels are not intended to prevent perception but to

Prevention of excess contact currents is possible by

# SIMULTANEOUS EXPOSURE TO

**MULTIPLE FREQUENCY FIELDS**

It is important to determine whether, in situations of
simultaneous exposure to fields of different frequencies,
these exposures are additive in their effects. The formulae below apply to relevant frequencies under practical
exposure situations. For electrical stimulation, relevant
for frequencies up to 10 MHz, internal electric fields
should be added according to

10 _MHz_ _E_
i,j

_j_   1 _Hz_ _E_ L,j [] [ 1] (3)

where _E_ i,j is the internal electric field strength induced at
frequency _j_, and _E_ L, j is the induced electric field strength
restriction at frequency _j_ as given in Table 2.
For practical application of the basic restrictions, the
following criteria regarding reference levels of field
strengths should be applied:

_E_ R,j [] [ 1]

and applying the multiple frequency rule described
above. This procedure is based on the assumption that the
spectral components add in phase, i.e., all maxima
coincide at the same time and results in a sharp peak.
This is a realistic assumption when the number of
spectral components is limited and their phases are not
coherent, i.e., they vary randomly. For fixed coherent
phases the assumption may be unnecessarily conservative. Additionally, sampling and windowing in FT spectral analysis may create spurious frequencies, which may
artificially increase the linearly summed exposure ratio.
An alternative option to the spectral method is to
weight the external electric and magnetic fields, induced electric field and induced current with a filter

function which is related to the basic restriction or

reference level (ICNIRP 2003b; Jokela 2000). In the
case of a broadband field consisting of harmonic
components the restriction imposed by the filtering
can be presented mathematically as

where _I_ j is the contact current component at frequency _j_,
and _I_ L,j is the reference level of the contact current at
frequency _j_ as given in Table 5.

# NON SINUSOIDAL EXPOSURE

At low frequencies below 100 kHz the electric and
particularly magnetic fields are in most cases distorted by
harmonic components distributed over a large frequency
band. Consequently, the waveforms of the fields show
complex, often pulsed, patterns. It is always possible to
decompose such a field to discrete spectral components
by using, e.g., Fourier Transformation techniques (FT)

where _t_ is time and _EL_ i is the exposure limit at the _i_ th
harmonic frequency _f_ i, where _A_ i,  i, i, are the amplitudes
of the field, phase angles of the field and phase angles of
the filter at the harmonic frequencies. Except the phase
angles, the equation is similar to the summation eqns (3),
(4), and (5). More guidance on the practical implementation
of the weighting (determination of the weighted peak
exposure) is given in the informative annex (Appendix).

# PROTECTIVE MEASURES

ICNIRP notes that protection of people exposed to
electric and magnetic fields could be ensured by compliance with all aspects of these guidelines.
Measures for the protection of workers include
engineering and administrative controls, and personal
protection programs. Appropriate protective measures
must be implemented when exposure in the workplace
results in the basic restrictions being exceeded. As a first
step, engineering controls should be undertaken wherever possible to reduce device emissions of fields to
acceptable levels. Such controls include good safety
design and, where necessary, the use of interlocks or
similar health protection mechanisms.
Administrative controls, such as limitations on access and the use of audible and visible warnings, should
be used in conjunction with engineering controls. Personal protection measures, such as protective clothing,
though useful in certain circumstances, should be regarded as a last resort to ensure the safety of the worker,

830 Health Physics December 2010, Volume 99, Number 6

and priority should be given to engineering and administrative controls wherever possible. Furthermore, when
such items as insulated gloves are used to protect
individuals from shock, the basic restrictions must not be
exceeded, since the insulation protects only against
indirect effects of the fields.

With the exception of protective clothing and other
personal protection, the same measures can be applied to
the general public whenever there is a possibility that the
general public reference levels might be exceeded. It is
also essential to establish and implement rules that will
prevent

- interference with medical electronic equipment and
devices (including cardiac pacemakers);

- detonation of electro-explosive devices (detonators);
and

- fires and explosions resulting from ignition of flammable materials by sparks caused by induced fields,
contact currents, or spark discharges.

# CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING POSSIBLE

**LONG-TERM EFFECTS**

As noted above, epidemiological studies have consistently found that everyday chronic low-intensity
(above 0.3-0.4  T) power frequency magnetic field
exposure is associated with an increased risk of childhood leukemia. IARC has classified such fields as

possibly carcinogenic. However, a causal relationship
between magnetic fields and childhood leukemia has not
been established nor have any other long term effects
been established. The absence of established causality
means that this effect cannot be addressed in the basic

restrictions. However, risk management advice, including considerations on precautionary measures, has been
given by WHO (2007a and b) and other entities.

# APPENDIX

**Informative annex**

**Determination of the weighted peak exposure.**
The weighting may be implemented by computing first
the spectrum of the waveform and then applying eqn (7).
In many applications, however, it is more convenient to
use analog or digital filtering of the waveform in the time
domain. The gain of the filter (ratio of the output to the
input signal) should vary as a function of frequency in
direct proportion to the exposure limit _G_  _EL_ ( _f_ ref )/ _EL_ ( _f_ ),
where _EL_ is the limit at frequency _f_ and _f_ ref is an arbitrary
reference frequency from 1 Hz to 100 kHz. The peak
value of the filtered waveform should not exceed the

exposure limit (basic restriction or reference level) converted to the peak (amplitude) value at the reference
frequency. Table 6 shows an example of the derived peak
limits. In addition to the amplitude physical filters always
influence on the phase of the field, which changes the
peak value of the filtered field. As shown in Figs. 1, 2,
and 3 the limits are divided to the frequency ranges
where the limit varies directly proportional to 1/ _f_ [2], 1/ _f_, _f_ [0]

(constant), or _f_ . On the 1/ _f_ [2], 1/ _f_, _f_ [0], and _f_ ranges the phase
angle of the filter i (see eqn 7) is 180, 90, 0, and  90°,
respectively. The weighting filter can be approximated
with an electronic or digital filter where the attenuation
should not deviate more than 3 dB and phase more than
90° from the exact piecewise linear frequency response.
As an example, Fig. A1 shows the attenuation and phase
as a function of frequency for the filter used for the
weighting of the induced electric field. The approximate
curves are based on a simple approximation with RC
(resistor/capacitor) type filter function. The weighted
peak approach can be used both for coherent and noncoherent fields. In the latter case the measurement time

must be long enough to detect the worst case peak value
with a reasonable probability. In the case of non-coherent
fields, consisting of a few frequencies, the weighted peak
approach is identical to the spectral summation.

**Table 6.** Derived peak limits for non-sinusoidal electric and
magnetic fields. The reference frequency is 50 Hz.
